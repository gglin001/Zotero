Abstract Objective: A novel photoplethysmograph (PPG) probe employs dual photodiodes excited using

28

single infrared light source was developed for local Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) measurement.

29

The potential use of proposed system in cuffless Blood Pressure (BP) techniques was

30

demonstrated. Approach: Initial validation measurements were performed on a phantom using a

31

reference method. Further, an in-vivo study was carried out in 35 volunteers (age = 284.5

32 33

years). Carotid local PWV, carotid to finger Pulse Transit Time (PTTR) and Pulse Arrival Time at the carotid artery (PATC) were simultaneously measured. Beat-by-beat variation of local PWV

34

due to BP changes was studied during post-exercise relaxation. Cuffless BP estimation accuracy

35

of local PWV, PATC, and PTTR was investigated based on inter- and intra-subject models with

36

best-case calibration. Main results: Accuracy of the proposed system, hardware inter-channel

37

delay (< 0.1 ms), repeatability (beat-to-beat variation = 4.15% - 11.38%) and reproducibility of

38

measurement (r = 0.96) were examined. For the phantom experiment, measured PWV values did

39

not differ by more than 0.74 m/s compared to the reference PWV. Better correlation was

40

observed between brachial BP parameters versus local PWV (r = 0.74 – 0.78) compared to PTTR

41

(|r| = 0.62 – 0.67) and PATC (|r| = 0.52 – 0.68). Cuffless BP estimation using local PWV was

42

better than PTTR and PATC with population-specific models. More accurate estimates of arterial

43

BP levels were achieved using local PWV via subject-specific models (root-mean-square-error ≤

44

2.61 mmHg). Significance: A reliable system for cuffless BP measurement and local estimation

45

of arterial wall properties.

1. Introduction

52

Arterial Blood Pressure (BP) measurement in routine clinical diagnostic practice and

53

hypertension management is often performed using cuff-type manometers. The conventional

54

cuff-based methods (auscultatory and oscillometric techniques) provide only intermittent

55

pressure levels with systolic and diastolic values. Short- or long-term continuous BP monitoring

56

and BP variability have been well-recognized as an accurate determinant of cardiovascular

57

diseases (Ding et al 2016, Peter et al 2014). The conventional cuff-based devices cannot be

58

directly used for continuous BP monitoring and tracking of beat-to-beat variations. Continuous

59

measurement of finger arterial pressure has been developed based on the volume-clamp method

using a finger cuff and an inflatable bladder (Bogert et al 2005). However, all cuff-based BP assessment techniques are known to suffer from several limitations (Buxi et al 2015).

7

Cuff-less techniques for continuous BP measurement involving arterial pressure and flow

8

wave dynamics are widely pursued (Ding et al 2016, Mukkamala et al 2015). A number of

9

approaches for continuous cuff-less BP measurement have been developed using regional Pulse

10

Wave Velocity (PWV), Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) (Mukkamala

11

et al 2015). However, the accuracy and reliability of cuffless BP techniques using regional

12

transit time estimates are limited due to the following reasons; (a) variation of pre-ejection

13

period in PAT with cardiac electro-mechanical properties (Martin et al 2016), (b) Regional

14

PWV and PTT obtained from two distinct arterial sites with different mechanical characteristics

15

provide only an average estimate (Pereira et al 2015), (c) Coarse approximation of the pulse

16 17 18 19

propagation distance in regional PWV assessment (Pereira et al 2015, Boutouyrie et al 2009) constituting error in estimated BP parameters, (d) Biomechanical equations relating flow wave dynamics and BP parameters hold true only when no wave reflections occur (Bramwell and Hill

20

1922, Westenberg et al 2012). These inherent sources of error in regional estimates create the

21

necessity for frequent subject- and/or population-specific recalibration and hence, limit the use

22

of such devices in routine clinical diagnostic practice (Mukkamala et al 2015, McCarthy et al

23

2013, Ding et al 2016). It is necessary to overcome aforementioned shortcomings to develop an

24

accurate cuff-free system for continuous BP measurement.

25

Studies have reported that PWV measurement made on a small segment of an artery (local

26

PWV) represent the true blood pulse propagation velocity (Pereira et al 2015, Hermeling et al

27

2010). Precisely measured local PWV values are free from error due to a coarse approximation

28

of propagation distance and multiple wave reflections. Hence, it can be considered as a better

29 30 31 32

marker of arterial pressure levels. In this work, we propose a novel photoplethysmograph (PPG) probe for local PWV measurement. The design consists of two photodiodes placed at adjacent measurement points, excited using a single infrared light source (single-source PPG transducer).

33

A prototype device was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of capturing dual PPG signals

34

and beat-by-beat local PWV measurement using single-source PPG probe. Performance and

35

measurement accuracy of the developed local PWV device was initially validated by conducting

36

in-vitro experiments on a phantom. Real-time signal acquisition, repeatability and

37

reproducibility of the device were further validated on 35 human volunteers. The efficiency of

38

the device to detect beat-to-beat variation in local PWV due to arterial pressure changes was

39

verified on young and healthy volunteers during their post-exercise recovery period. Further,

40

cuffless estimation of arterial BP levels using local PWV with inter- and intra-subject

41

mathematical models was demonstrated. It was also the objective of this study to assess carotid

42 43 44

to finger PTT (PTTR) and arrival time of pulse wave at the carotid artery (PATC) so that it could be compared with local PWV as markers of arterial BP levels.

45

46

2. Design of single-source PPG transducer

47

The proposed single-source PPG probe design has a specific functional structure: two highly

48

sensitive photodiodes symmetrically placed at precise and well-known distance on either side of

49

a single light source. A narrow beam Infrared Light Emitting Diode (IR LED) was used as the

50

light source to illuminate the arterial site under measurement. Infrared wavelength was preferred

51

to ensure deeper penetration of light into the tissue owing to its lower absorption by

52

pigmentation (Cai et al 2008, Delpy et al 1997). Photodiodes were able to capture reflected light

53 54 55

from two distinct measurement locations. The output signals represent underlying blood pulse wave propagation through the illuminated artery (reflectance photoplethysmography principle).

56

A significant transit time delay was observed between simultaneously acquired dual pulse

57

waveforms. This blood pulse transit time delay obtained from a smaller arterial section was used

58

for local PWV measurement. The initial prototype design was optimized for local PWV

59

measurement from the carotid site (carotid local PWV). The carotid artery was preferred since it

23

A three-dimensional (3D) sketch of sensor assembly and packaging of the single-source PPG

24

transducer has been presented in figure 1. The IR LED (OSRAM Opto Semiconductors – SFH

25

4451, 850 nm) was soldered at the middle of a custom designed rectangular (36 mm  8 mm)

26

transducer printed circuit board (PCB). Two highly sensitive photodiodes with 16 mm2 window

27

size (OSI Optoelectronics – 16 CSL) were also soldered on the transducer PCB. Multiple trials

28

on different subjects were conducted to finalize the center-to-center separation distance (δ)

29

between IR LED and photodiodes. Initial experiment results revealed that the sensor

30 31 32

arrangement with δ less than 6 mm does not provide adequate penetration depth for incident light. As a result, PPG probe was not able to detect arterial pulsations. Simultaneous acquisition

33

of dual pulse signal from multiple subjects was difficult when δ greater than 20 mm. Hence, an

34

optimum distance of δ = 12 mm was used in the present prototype design.

35

The IR LED was driven by a high current (more than 45 mA) such that the light intensity

36

was sufficient to obtain dual PPG signals irrespective of artery depth and thickness of tissue

37

layer above the artery. IR LED and photodiodes were kept inside a black colored light absorbing

38

cage. It was used to avoid the permanent saturation of photodiodes due to the direct coupling of

39

incident infrared light. Optimized cage dimensions with 5 mm thick isolating barrier between

40

the IR LED-photodiode pair was preferred. Transducer PCB and isolation cage were attached

41

and enclosed in probe holder. Finally, IR LED and photodiodes were coated with a transparent

42

general purpose silicone sealant (Wacker-GP). Silicone coating on light source and detectors

43 44 45

help to maintain optical continuity between sensing area and the skin surface. The overall size of the developed single-source PPG probe was 36.5 mm  8.5 mm  6.7 mm with 28 mm end-

46

to-end distance between the active windows of photodiodes.

50

3.1. Analog front-end hardware features

51

Arterial blood pulse signal acquired using PPG transducers consists of both static (DC) and

52

pulsating (AC) components (Kamal et al 1989, Lindberg and Öberg 1993). The DC component

53

of PPG signal is proportional to total blood volume in the measurement area. AC component is

54

synchronized with the cardiac cycle and follows arterial blood volume and flow changes. AC

55

component of PPG signal is typically less than 0.2% of DC amplitude. Removal of DC from the

56

PPG waveforms was mandatory for the amplification of AC components without causing

57 58 59

permanent saturation of amplifiers. In practice, it not straightforward to remove DC components from the PPG signals without introducing any additional signal propagation delay. Direct use of

60

resistor-capacitor based signal conditioning filters for DC elimination causes significant inter-

channel delay due to the mismatch between their characteristic time constants. A non-zero inter-

18

channel delay was critical for transit time delay measurements employing sensors placed in

19

close proximity. Hence, an analog front-end (AFE) circuit with negligible inter-channel delay

20

and a high-speed signal acquisition module were desired for reliable blood pulse detection.

21

An application-specific dual-channel AFE was designed and developed for simultaneous

22

acquisition of PPG signals. The basic circuit schematic of the AFE, internal circuit diagram of

23

single-source PPG probe and software architecture of proposed measurement system has been

24

described in figure 2. The proposed AFE design was primarily focused on reducing the inter-

25 26 27

channel delay between analog channels. Extraction of pulsatile components from the raw blood pulse signals using DC subtraction (without any signal conditioning filters and energy storage

28

elements in the principal signal path) significantly reduces the inter-channel delay (Nabeel et al

29

2017). As illustrated in figure 2, the output current signals from photodiodes of PPG transducers

30

were initially converted into a voltage signal using transimpedance amplifiers. Average DC

31

voltage of PPG signal was extracted using an R-C network (corner frequency = 0.05 Hz)

32

implemented in the parallel signal path. Raw PPG signal and its average DC voltage level from

33

each channel were given to the VI+N and VI−N input terminals of precision instrumentation

34

amplifiers (Texas Instruments – INA2126) respectively, via Opamp (Texas Instruments –

35

TL082CP) based voltage buffers. Subtraction of the DC component from original PPG signal

36

and further amplification (gain ≈ 40 dB) was performed by the instrumentation amplifier.

37 38 39

Amplified PPG signals were digitized using a simultaneous sampling data acquisition (DAQ) module (National Instruments® – PXIe-6368). Signals were continuously acquired at a sampling

40

rate of 100 kS/s/ch with 16-bit resolution. Use of a simultaneous sampling DAQ card with high

41

sampling rate helped to eliminate any mismatch due to digital pipelining, data transfer delays

42

and timing error arising from the system sampling clock.

43

44

3.2. Software architecture and signal processing

45

Signal acquisition and processing were performed by a custom program developed using

46

LabVIEW (National Instruments®). Digital domain processing, transit time measurement, and

47

PWV calculation were automatically performed. The measurement algorithm (figure 2) was

48

divided into two steps: signal processing and pulse wave analysis. In the signal processing

49

stage, acquired PPG waveforms were low-pass filtered using Butterworth 2nd order digital filter.

50

Since the expected range of blood pulse signal frequency in human is from 0.7 Hz to 3 Hz, the

51 52 53

low-pass filter was realized with 10 Hz cut-off frequency, thus allowing the fundamental and at least two harmonics, while eliminating the out-of-band noise. Zero phase difference between

54

raw signal and the filtered signal was ensured by applying filter operation in the forward and

55

backward direction (zero-phase shift filter operation). Further, the baseline drift of the PPG

56

waveforms caused by body movement and respiration was removed using wandering removal

57

process (Fedotov et al 2014). Finally, cycle cutting was performed to separate each beat from

58

the signal train and to collate the corresponding proximal and distal cardiac cycle pairs. For this,

59

the diastolic minimum points of proximal PPG signal were automatically detected from each

60

beat. 50 ms prior to the diastolic minimum was taken as the fiducial point for cycle cutting.

Time axis of the proximal and distal cardiac cycle pairs was synchronized by taking same fiducial points in both channels. These cycle pairs were used for beat-by-beat local PWV

7

measurement. The LabVIEW program also provides provision for real-time signal storage of

8

acquired waveforms for future reference.

3.3. Pulse wave analysis

11

The arterial pulse signal is composed of a forward moving blood pulse wave superimposed with

12

reflected signals from various bifurcation points in the arterial tree (Boutouyrie et al 2009). The

13

reflected signals voyage with different propagation velocity and amplitude. Depending on the

14

arterial sites, the reflected signals alter the shape and timing information of original pulse signal.

15

Since the early systolic region of blood pulse is minimally affected by the reflected waves

16

(Hermeling et al 2007), the characteristic points for transit time measurements are often selected

17 18 19 20

from this region. Characteristic points are specific identification points based on the physiological features of blood pulse waveform. The time delay between characteristic points of proximal and distal cycle pair is referred to as transit time (ΔT). Therefore, precise identification

21

of characteristic points is highly desirable for accurate ΔT and PWV calculation.

22

23

3.3.1. Characteristics point identification. The second derivative maximum technique

24

(Kazanavicius et al 2015) was implemented for characteristic point identification. It was

25

reported as an efficient method for repeatable measurements (Chiu et al 1991). The second

26

derivative maximum technique uses the point at which the second derivative of a blood pulse

27

cycle is maximal as its characteristic point. It is typically close to the systolic foot position,

28

where the change in slope is maximum. For a given cardiac cycle with dataset values (Ψ)

29

collected at time intervals (t) having a finite sample number (k), the second derivative can be

30

determined using the formula,

3.3.2. Local ΔT and PWV measurement. The pulse wave analysis phase emphasized on accurate

37

measurement of ΔT to obtain reliable carotid local PWV values. Using characteristic point

38

detection algorithm, local ΔT was calculated from the fiducial points of proximal and distal

39

carotid pulse cycle pair (figure 3). Centre-to-centre distance between the photodiodes was taken

40

as blood pulse propagation distance (ΔD). Within a small distance (ΔD = 24 mm), the carotid

41

artery was assumed to be a homogeneous section with no curvature. Finally, carotid local PWV

42

was estimated from each cardiac cycles in a beat-by-beat manner using (2).

3.4. Finger PPG and ECG signal acquisition

48

Real-time finger PPG and ECG signals were also acquired along with dual carotid PPG for

49

simultaneous measurement of local PWV, PTTR, and PATC. Synchronized acquisition of all

50

four waveforms was performed by the developed local PWV measurement system advanced

51

with two sub-units: one for the finger PPG signal acquisition and another one for real-time ECG

52 53 54 55

signal acquisition. Carotid PPG AFE design was replicated in finger PPG channel for signal acquisition using transmittance type fingertip PPG probe. Reference ECG signal was acquired using a commercial three electrodes system with fully integrated single-lead AFE (Analog

56

Devices Inc. – AD8232). Signals were digitized using a simultaneous sampling DAQ card

57

(National Instruments® – PXIe-6368) at a sampling rate of 100 kS/s/ch. The signal processing

58

software was also modified for simultaneous measurement of local PWV, PTTR, and PATC. As

59

illustrated in figure 3, PTTR was determined as the time delay between fiducial points of

60

proximal carotid PPG signal and finger PPG signal. PATC was determined as the time delay

4. In-vitro validation technique and results

30

Design efficiency and functionality of the single-source PPG probe and proposed local PWV

31

device were experimentally validated by an in-vitro study. The study was performed using a

32

commercially available manikin phantom with realistic carotid artery anatomy (Blue Phantom-

33

CAE Healthcare – BPIJ500-C). Figure 5(a) presents the experimental setup of the performed in-

34

vitro validation study. Arterial pulsations were manually simulated by controlled and repetitive

35

pumping of the provided hand bulb. The study comprised the recording of phantom pulse

36

waveforms, and assessment of pulse propagation velocity of blood mimicking fluid through the

37 38 39 40

phantom (PWVP) using single-source PPG transducer (measured PWVP) and a reference
method (reference PWVP). Conventional two-point PWV measurement technique using dual pressure waves from identical tonometers (Millar® Instruments – SPT-301) was considered as

41

the reference method (Salvi et al 2008, Nabeel et al 2017). Both the tonometers (uncalibrated)

42

were rigidly fixed on the neck above the carotid artery of the phantom model with a separation

43

of 70 mm. The single-source PPG probe was adhered to the phantom between the tonometers

44

using a transparent two-sided adhesive tape as shown in figure 5(a).

45

Phantom pulse waveforms detected by the single-source PPG transducer was acquired and

46

processed using the prototype local PWV device. Tonometer signal acquisition and processing

47

were performed using ADInstruments’ LabChart software via Bridge Amp and PowerLab.

48

Simultaneously acquired proximal and distal phantom pulse waveforms from the tonometers

49

and single-source PPG probe are shown in figure 5(b) and figure 5(c) respectively, exhibiting

50 51 52 53 54

same average pulse rate. Figure 5(d) depicts the reference and measured PWVP values along with their difference (reference PWVP – measured PWVP), obtained from continuous phantom pulse cycles simulated at various pressure level. 80% of the measurements were within an error band of 0.5 m/s, and the maximum difference between the reference and measured PWVP was

55

0.74 m/s. Both methods correlated significantly (r = 0.97, p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman

56

analysis (figure 5(e)) revealed a non-significant bias of –0.015 m/s with standard deviation (SD)

57

of differences equal to 0.38 m/s. Validation measurements in the phantom demonstrated the

58

expected functionality of single-source PPG probe and associated measurement system. The

59

proposed device found to allow accurate and reliable estimation of local PWV in a non-invasive

60

and continuous manner.

5.2. Subject selection Thirty-five normotensive subjects (age = 284.5 years; gender: 23 males and 12 females; height = 16812 cm; weight = 7315 kg) were recruited for the in-vivo validation study. Written

8

informed consent was obtained from all participants after explaining the study objective and

9

protocol. Anthropometric measurements were initially taken and recorded in the subject

10

database. Participants were requested to take 5 min rest in a temperature controlled room

11

(232C) before the study to achieve a steady heartrate and BP state.

5.3. In-vivo study protocol

15

5.3.1. Blood pulse signal acquisition and local PWV measurement. Local PWV measurement

16

was performed on left common carotid artery (sitting posture) by a single operator. Single-

17 18 19 20

source PPG probe was placed at the carotid site after identifying the artery by palpation. Probe placement and orientation were adjusted to acquire dual PPG waveforms. Beat-by-beat local PWV value was recorded for 30 seconds on each subject for repeatability test.

21

22

5.3.2. Local PWV reproducibility evaluation. Reproducibility of the proposed system was tested

23

by performing sequential measurement of local PWV. Consecutive measurements were taken

24

from each volunteer by the same operator for a fixed time interval (15 seconds) with a small

25

break (10 seconds) between each trial. Mean local PWV values of consecutive trials were used

26

for intra-operator reproducibility analysis.

27

28

5.3.3. BP measurement from the brachial artery. Brachial BP measurement on the left arm

29

using a pressure cuff was performed at various stages throughout the validation study. A clinical

30

grade automated oscillometric BP apparatus (SunTech® 247TM) was used for Systolic Blood

31

Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)

32 33

measurement. Average BP values of two consecutive trials were used for analysis.

34 35

5.3.4. Simultaneous measurement of local PWV, PTTR, and PATC. Once the data collection for

36

repeatability and reproducibility analysis was finished, volunteers were prepared with sensors

37

for local PWV, PTTR, and PATC measurement. As explained in the previous section, carotid

38

PPG signals were recorded using single-source PPG probe. A commercially available SpO2 clip

39

(NellcorTM – DS100A) was attached to the left index finger for finger PPG. Disposable ECG

40

skin electrodes with pre-gelled Ag/AgCl sensors were placed on the left hand, right hand and

41

right leg for ECG signal. Brachial BP was recorded before the signal acquisition. Beat-by-beat

42

carotid local PWV, PTTR and PATC were simultaneously measured for 30 seconds. Respective

43

mean values and brachial BP obtained from all 35 subjects were used for correlation analysis

44

and to develop inter-subject cuffless BP models.

45

46 47 48

5.3.5. Local PWV measurement during post-exercise relaxation. An exercise study was conducted to verify the ability of proposed device to detect local PWV variations due to arterial

49 50

pressure changes. Only those individuals with age less than 30 years and no history of any serious diseases were recruited for this study (7 subjects; age = 243 years). After the baseline

51

measurements, volunteers were subjected to running exercise on a treadmill (Afton – XO-150).

52

Starting from minimum speed (1 km/h), exercise continued for 10 min at various speed levels

53

(maximum up to 10 km/h). Volunteers were comfortably seated after the exercise for complete

54

relaxation. During this period, local PWV was continuously acquired from the left carotid

55

artery, and brachial BP was measured at regular time intervals. Measurements were recorded

56

until BP returned to the baseline value or remained steady. The data collected from the exercise

57

study was used to develop intra-subject models for cuffless BP measurement. These models

58

were tested using the second dataset of baseline BP and local PWV values collected at random

59 60

time intervals from same subjects during their routine work.

6.1. Measurement accuracy and potential error sources

8

Before the detailed analysis of in-vivo study observations and results, a brief discussion about

9

the accuracy of the measurement system and potential error sources in the recorded carotid local

10

PWV are presented. Ambiguity in ΔD was controlled by precision placement of photodiodes

11

during the final transducer assembly process. ΔD (= 24 mm) was measured using a digital

12

Vernier caliper (Mitutoyo – Digimatic Caliper - CD-6”VC) with an instrumental error of 0.03

13

mm. Hence, a maximum of 0.125% error in ΔD (%εΔD = 0.125%) was expected in the prototype

14

design of single-source PPG probe.

15

Hardware inter-channel delay and system sampling clock can introduce timing errors in local

16

PWV estimates. Inter-channel delay obtained from five selected subjects with different heartrate

17 18 19

and BP is presented in figure 6. It was measured by feeding carotid PPG signal from a single sensor to both the input channels simultaneously. The band inside each box in figure 6 indicate

20

the median of inter-channel delay values obtained from multiple cycles. Bottom and top of the

21

boxes indicate the first and third quartiles with vertical lines extending to the minimum and the

22

maximum delay values respectively. A maximum of 1.8% error in local ΔT (%εΔT = 1.8%) was

23

expected due to hardware inter-channel delay. Timing errors caused by the sampling of

24

acquisition module (sampling rate = 100 kS/s/ch; clock period = 10 s) was insignificant when

25

compared to the expected local ΔT values. Further, the tissue transit time of infrared light wave

26

is much shorter than the blood pulse transit time. Any difference in tissue transit time at two

27

measurement locations can be neglected due to similar skin and tissue composition within a

28

small section. Therefore, the expected error in carotid local PWV (%εlocal PWV = %εΔD + %εΔT)

29

due to hardware limitations was less than 2%.

30

31 32 33

6.2. Reliability of carotid blood pulse signal acquisition Proximal and distal blood pulse signals for local PWV measurement was acquired from multiple

34

subjects under different physiological conditions. Measurement algorithm was susceptible to the

35

quality of the acquired blood pulse waveforms. The prototype device was able to acquire dual

36

PPG waveforms with signal-to-noise ratio approximately 28 dB, which was adequate for

37

reliable local ΔT measurement using the second derivative maximum technique (Solà et al

38

2009). Figure 7 exhibits carotid blood pulse waveforms (after signal conditioning) acquired

39

from a volunteer (age = 26 years, body mass index (BMI) = 25.05 kg/m2, SBP/DBP = 118/73

40

mmHg). Competency of the single-source PPG transducer to acquire distinct pulse waveforms

41

from adjacent sites makes the proposed design perfect for local PWV measurement. The peak-

42 43

to-peak amplitude of raw pulse waveforms was subjective and varied between 6 to 17 mVPP in individual subjects during the present study. Inter-beat period of acquired PPG signals was

6.3. Repeatability and reproducibility of carotid local PWV measurement

34

The prototype design of single-source PPG probe was efficient and facilitates easy measurement

35

of beat-by-beat carotid local PWV. Artery detection, probe placement and orientation

36

procedures, signal acquisition, and measurement process were completed within 2 min. Baseline

37 38 39 40

carotid PWV estimates were less compared to previously reported carotid-to-femoral and
carotid-to-radial PWV (Reusz et al 2010). Mean carotid local PWV values obtained from 35 subjects were in the range of 2.520.41 m/s. It was consistently observed for multiple subjects

41

with high reproducibility under various physiological conditions. The obtained values were

42

comparable with carotid PWV reported in previous studies using ultrasound and accelerometer

43

transducers (Sorensen et al 2008, Faita et al 2010). Figure 8(a) to 8(c) shows the recorded beat-

44

by-beat carotid local PWV values of three different volunteers (30 seconds data). Beat-to-beat

45

variation was calculated by dividing their SD with mean and expressing it in percentage. The

46

minimum and maximum beat-to-beat variation observed during the study were 4.15% and

47

11.38%. Relatively high beat-to-beat variation (7.01% – 11.38%) was observed in subjects with

48

obesity and weak carotid surface pulsations.

49 50 51 52

Repeated sequential measurement of local PWV by the same operator allowed evaluation of reproducibility of the measurement system. Agreement between two consecutive sets of measurement (Trial I and Trial II) was evaluated via Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and

53

Bland-Altman analysis. Statistical significance on all tests was indicated by p-value < 0.05.

54

Mean carotid PWV from first set measurement did not differ significantly from the second set

55

for each subject. As illustrated in figure 9(a), the Bland-Altman analysis shows a non-significant

56

bias of 0.02 m/s with an SD of the differences equal to 0.11 m/s. Agreement between the two

57

consecutive measurements from multiple subjects has been depicted in figure 9(b). The

58

correlation between two sets of measurements were highly significant (r = 0.96, p < 0.001).

59

Study results favor the reproducibility of developed local PWV measurement system.

6.4. Cuffless BP estimation accuracy of local PWV, PTTR, and PATC

22

Single-source PPG device advanced with finger PPG and ECG sub-units was capable of

23

simultaneous acquisition of required biopotential signals. Reliable estimates of local PWV,

24

PTTR (beat-to-beat variation < 6.39%) and PATC (beat-to-beat variation < 8.01%) were

25

obtained. The absolute value of measured PTTR and PATC were in the range of 229.1627.96

26

ms and 86.7812.61 ms respectively. Mean carotid local PWV, PTTR, and PATC of all recruited

27

volunteers were consolidated along with their brachial BP for statistical analysis and to develop

28

inter-subject mathematical models for cuffless BP measurement. Figure 10(a) to 10(i) shows the

29

relationship between brachial BP parameters (SBP, DBP, and MAP) versus mean local PWV,

30 31 32

PTTR, and PATC pooled overall 35 subjects. PTTR and PATC were preferred over respective regional PWV values in cuffless BP models in order to avoid error due to the coarse

33

approximation of distance between the test points (Pereira et al 2015).

34

The logarithmic function provided the best monotonic fit with maximum correlation for the

35

data points of each BP parameter versus each pulse transit time estimates. Inter-subject

36

mathematical models of the form BP =  ln (υ) +  (υ can be local PWV or PTTR or PATC; , 

37

are population-specific constants), and the absolute value of correlation coefficients (|r|) are

38

summarized in table 1. The correlation coefficients were statistically significant (p < 0.001) and

39

all three transit time estimates were able to track BP parameters. However, carotid local PWV

40

showed better correlation (r > 0.74) with brachial BP levels than PTTR (|r| = 0.62 – 0.67) and

41 42

PATC (|r| = 0.52 – 0.68). Inter-subject models derived from the first group of 35 subjects were used for cuffless BP estimation in a different group of 28 subjects (age = 29.56 years, gender:

43 44 45

20 males and 8 females; height = 1709 cm; weight = 7512 kg). Local PWV, PTTR, PATC and reference brachial BP were recorded from the second group by following the same protocol

46

discussed in Section 5.3.

47

Cuffless BP estimation accuracy of each transit time estimates was compared with the

48

reference brachial BP via Bland-Altman analysis as well as by computing the root-mean-square-

49

error (RMSE). Comparison study results are presented in table 1. Bland-Altman analysis

50

showed non-significant bias (absolute value < 1.6 mmHg) for all estimated BP values. Carotid

51

local PWV yielded good DBP estimates with a RMSE of 6.33 mmHg; it was 34% and 48%

52

lower than the RMSE observed in cuffless DBP prediction using PTTR, and PATC respectively.

53

Local PWV also provided 23% and 14% lower RMSE for cuffless SBP prediction than PTTR,

54 55 56 57 58

and PATC respectively. Statistical comparison of reference versus estimated BP parameters was made using Pearson’s correlation analysis and Student’s paired t-test. The difference between reference and cuffless estimated BP in all nine cases were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). However, local PWV based BP prediction method showed better correlation with reference

59

values (SBP: r = 0.73, DBP: r = 0.79, MAP: r = 0.77; p < 0.001). Similar to PTTR, PATC based

60

BP prediction method was moderately correlated with reference BP parameters (r = 0.59 – 0.66;

p < 0.05). For completeness, conventional PAT (pulse arrival time at the fingertip (PATR))

value and proportional increment in BP parameters were observed after performing the exercise. Instantaneous variation in local PWV due to arterial pressure changes during post-exercise

7

recovery was efficiently tracked by the single-source PPG transducer. Figure 11 displays the

8

post-exercise recovery curve (local PWV, brachial BP parameters, and heartrate as a function of

9

time during the whole recovery period) of one subject (age = 26 years, BMI = 25.05 kg/m2).

10

Dynamics of the curve such as increment from the baseline value, recovery period and final

11

steady values were depended on individual’s physiological factors. Based on the recovery

12

characteristics, post-exercise recovery curve was divided into two phases: (a) transient phase

13

and (b) recovery phase. During the transient phase, local PWV, BP parameters and heartrate

14

decrease rapidly. Local PWV was scattered more in this phase due to heartrate variability,

unstable and fast breathing pattern. Local PWV and BP parameters continued to decrease at a

16 17 18 19 20

lower rate in the recovery phase. Heartrate variability and breathing pattern were fairly stable in the second phase.
Correlation between the intra-subject variation of local PWV versus brachial BP parameters was obtained for each subject. Local PWV correlated equally well with SBP (r = 0.9160.042,

21

p < 0.001), DBP (r = 0.9470.033, p < 0.001) and MAP (r = 0.9290.025, p < 0.001). This

22

statistically significant tight correlation suggested developing cuffless BP technique with intra-

23

subject mathematical models for accurate measurement. Consistent with theory (Mukkamala et

24

al 2015, Poon et al 2008), a logarithmic function provided the best monotonic fit for pairs of

25

local PWV–BP data points. The developed intra-subject mathematical model was specifically of

26

the form BP = Φ ln (local PWV) + Ω; Φ, Ω are subject-specific constants. Local PWV–BP

27

relationship derived from the post-exercise recovery curve shown in figure 11 has been depicted

28

in figure 12(a) to 12(c). Similar models were developed for each subject by finding the curve

29 30 31 32

that best fitted the data points obtained from their post-exercise recovery curve. Local PWV values collected from the recruited subjects during their routine work (second
dataset) were mapped through their respective mathematical models to predict the BP level.

each of the subjects). The proposed technique was able to predict SBP, DBP, and MAP with RMSEs of 2.61 mmHg, 2.32 mmHg, and 2.34 mmHg respectively. The corresponding RMSEs

25

offered by mapping local PWV through inter-subject models were 7.93 mmHg, 6.33 mmHg and

26

6.74 mmHg (refer table 1). In sum, cuffless techniques based on local PWV using inter-subject

27

models and best-case subject-specific calibration could potentially track arterial BP parameters

28

with a level of acceptable accuracy. By introducing more convenient methods for intra-subject

29

model development and improving form factor (example: single-source PPG patch), the

30

proposed single-source PPG device could be used for cuffless, ambulatory BP monitoring at

31

clinic/home and hypertension screening test.

6.6. Limitations and future efforts

34

The present in-vivo validation study was conducted on a small population of young and healthy

35 36 37 38

subjects. On the other hand, the current subjects do represent an important sub-population in the sense of early detection of cardiovascular diseases. An extensive validation study with a larger population, recruited from different age group and various pathophysiological sub-populations

39

would confirm and extend these results. Another limitation concerns the applicability of the

40

proposed device for self-monitoring without the assistance of a trained operator. Future efforts

41

are required to implement fully automated intelligent algorithms in the measurement software,

42

to guide the patient regarding probe placement and orientation to acquire dual PPG with the

43

desired signal quality for reliable measurements. Hence, the proposed device would turn out to

44

be a portable, self-monitoring cuffless BP equipment.

45

7. Conclusion

47

A prototype single-source PPG probe (dimension = 36.5 mm  8.5 mm  6.7 mm) for carotid

48

local PWV measurement was developed and demonstrated. The measurement system consists

49 50 51

of an application-specific AFE circuit (inter-channel delay < 0.1 ms), simultaneous sampling data acquisition module (100 kS/s/ch) and fully automated measurement software (developed

52

using LabVIEW). Real-time measurement accuracy of the introduced local PWV device was

53

demonstrated on an arterial flow phantom using dual tonometer reference setup. There was no

54

significant difference between the reference PWVP and measured PWVP values (absolute

55

difference ≤ 0.74 m/s, r = 0.97, p < 0.001) The device was further validated by conducting an

56

experimental in-vivo study on 35 subjects. It was able to capture high-fidelity blood pulse

57

signals (signal-to-noise ratio ≈ 28 dB) from small sections of the carotid artery. Carotid local

58

PWV was measured from multiple subjects in a non-invasive and continuous manner (beat-to-

59

beat variation = 4.15% – 11.38%). Simultaneously measured carotid local PWV, PTTR, and

60

PATC were compared as markers of BP, and arterial pressure levels were predicted using inter-

subject models. Local PWV was slightly better than PTTR and PATC in terms of tracking SBP (r = 0.74), DBP (r = 0.77) and MAP (r = 0.78). Intra-subject BP–local PWV models derived from post-exercise recovery curve of individual subjects (r > 0.9160.042) were more accurate in

8

tracking acute changes in BP parameters (RMSE ≤ 2.61 mmHg). Despite the practical

9

feasibility of inter-subject models with population-specific calibration, carotid local PWV

10

offered acceptable accuracy for cuffless BP measurement via intra-subject models with subject-

11

specific calibration. With successful future efforts, the proposed single-source PPG based

12

cuffless BP device could be potentially used for ambulatory and home BP monitoring,

13

hypertension screening, and control.
