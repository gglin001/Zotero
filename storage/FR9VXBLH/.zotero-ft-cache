HEART RATE VARIABILITY: CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND INTERACTION BETWEEN HRV AND HEART RATE

Topic Editors: Karin Trimmel, Medical University of Vienna, Austria Jerzy Sacha, Opole University of Technology, Poland Heikki Veli Huikuri, Univeristy of Oulu, Finland

Over the last decades, assessment of heart rate

variability (HRV) has increased in various

fields of research. HRV describes changes in

heartbeat intervals, which are caused by auto-

nomic neural regulation, i.e. by the interplay

of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic

nervous systems. The most frequent appli-

cation of HRV is connected to cardiological

issues, most importantly to the monitoring of

post-myocardial infarction patients and the

prediction of sudden cardiac death. Analysis

of HRV is also frequently applied in relation

to diabetes, renal failure, neurological and psy-

chiatric conditions, sleep disorders, psycholog-

ical phenomena such as stress, as well as drug

and addiction research including alcohol and

parameters to be analysed is still rising. Well-

established time domain and frequency domain parameters are discussed controversially when

it comes to their physiological interpretation and their psychometric properties like reliability

and validity, and the sensitivity to cardiovascular properties of the variety of parameters seems

to be a topic for further research. Recently introduced parameters like pNNxx and new dynamic

methods such as approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis offer new potentials

and warrant standardization.

However, HRV is significantly associated with average heart rate (HR) and one can conclude that HRV actually provides information on two quantities, i.e. on HR and its variability. It is hard to determine which of these two plays a principal role in the clinical value of HRV. The association between HRV and HR is not only a physiological phenomenon but also a

mathematical one which is due to non-linear (mathematical) relationship between RR interval and HR. If one normalizes HRV to its average RR interval, one may get ‘pure’ variability free from the mathematical bias. Recently, a new modification method of the association between HRV and HR has been developed which enables us to completely remove the HRV dependence on HR (even the physiological one), or conversely enhance this dependence. Such an approach allows us to explore the HR contribution to the clinical significance of HRV, i.e. whether HR or its variability plays a main role in the HRV clinical value.
This Research Topic covers recent advances in the application of HRV, methodological issues, basic underlying mechanisms as well as all aspects of the interaction between HRV and HR.

Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Billman, 2011). Indeed, the term “heart rate variability” yields nearly 18,000 “hits” when placed in the pubmed search engine. These temporal ﬂuctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration—the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and are widely believed to reﬂect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation (Billman, 2011). Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease (Billman, 2011). It is the purpose of this book to provide a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and limitations of HRV techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on the application of HRV techniques in the clinic and on the interaction between prevailing heart rate and HRV. This book contains both state-of-the art review and original research articles that have been grouped into two main sections: Methodological Considerations and Clinical Application. A brief summary of the chapters contained in each section follows below.
METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS The opening section provides a historical overview of the evolution in the concept of heart rate variability (Billman, 2011) and then describes time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure heart rate variability. Heathers (2014) and Billman (2013a) describe methodological issues in the analysis of short-term frequency-domain HRV such as the LF band, normalized units, or the LF/HF ratio as well as the inﬂuence of external factors on HRV data. These reviews provide substantial information on mathematical concerns in HRV analysis and on the interpretation of the underlying physiological background of HRV power and highlight the necessity of methodological improvement in HRV measurement. Peltola (2012) evaluates the

methods used to edit R-R interval time series and how this editing can inﬂuence the results obtained by the HRV analysis. The effects of prevailing HR on HRV are further evaluated in series of review and original research articles.
It is not widely appreciated that HRV is signiﬁcantly associated with average heart rate (HR) and that, as a consequence, HRV actually provides information on two quantities; i.e., HR and its variability (Sacha, 2014a,c). Sacha (2013, 2014b) demonstrate that interpretation of HRV data is further complicated by the inverse non-linear relationship between HR and R–R interval. Owing to this inverse (mathematical) relationship, the same ﬂuctuations of HR yield higher R-R interval changes for the slow than for the fast average HR, and therefore the standard analysis of heart rate variability may be mathematically biased (Sacha and Pluta, 2008). Thus, one must calculate HRV normalized to HR in order to differentiate between physiologically and mathematically mediated changes in HRV (Sacha, 2013). This normalization is particularly important if one compares HRV between the patients with different average HRs or during interventions that change HR. The effect of these normalization procedures are explored further in a series of original research articles.
For example, the effects of HR on the HRV response to different autonomic interventions were examined using a canine model (Billman, 2013b). Maneuvers that accelerated HR (e.g., submaximal exercise) caused a decrease in HRV even after normalization for the HR changes while interventions that slowed down HR yielded mixed results (e.g., baroreceptor reﬂex activation provoked an increase in HRV even after normalization for reﬂexively mediated reductions in HR, while beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists reduced rather than increased HRV after normalization for the drug-induced HR reductions) (Billman, 2013b). In a review article, Billman (2013a) further demonstrated that, among other factors, both heart rate and mathematical considerations profoundly inﬂuence the LF/HF ratio such that it is not possible to determine the physiological basis for this widely use index (Billman, 2013a). He concluded that the preponderance of evidence conﬁrms that the LF/HF ratio cannot accurately quantify cardiac “sympatho-vagal balance” either in health or disease (Billman, 2013a).
In another article, Grant et al. demonstrate (by employment of the normalization method) that HR is a better indicator of higher

ﬁtness than HRV; i.e., an association between HRV indices and maximal oxygen intake (VO2max) exists mainly due to the relationship between HR and VO2max (Grant et al., 2013). On the other hand, the same normalization method enabled Carter et al. to show that an increase in HRV following dengue viral infection does not result from the accompanying reduction in HR, but reﬂects a real improvement in cardiac autonomic nervous control (Carter et al., 2014). Finally, Pradhapan et al. (2014) examined the impact of HR on HRV on the results of exercise stress testing and found that HR immediately before exercise was not a risk factor of death, and the removal of its inﬂuence improved the HRV predictive power. Conversely, HR during the recovery phase was a signiﬁcant mortality predictor, and the enhancement of its impact (by using the method of Sacha et al., 2013) increased the HRV predictive ability (Pradhapan et al., 2014). These examples clearly show that it is very important to establish to what extent HRV changes associated with simultaneous HR alterations are physiologically and mathematically determined. Unraveling this remarkable interplay between HRV and HR may yield valuable prognostic information (Sacha, 2014b). Further studies are needed to determine which of the two, i.e. HR or HRV, provides better predictive performance for a given population and outcome as well as to what modiﬁcations of the HRV/HR relationship increase the prognostic power of HRV (Sacha, 2014b).

artery bypass graft (CABG) patients by the analysis of HRV variables and comparing changes in the 6-min-walk-test and peak VO2. It was shown that CR signiﬁcantly improved exercise capacity and positively affected HRV changes especially in the CABG group. Hinojosa-Laborde et al. (2011) investigated whether any HRV index could accurately distinguish between individuals with high and low tolerances to simulated hemorrhage (i.e., lower body negative pressure). They report that, although a few HRV indices could accurately differentiate between low and high tolerance subjects when considered as group (i.e., difference in group means), a given individual’s HRV value provided a poor indicator of tolerance to hypovolemia. Finally, Tobaldini et al. (2013) reviewed linear and non-linear analyses of HRV to assess autonomic changes during sleep under physiological as well as pathological conditions such as sleep-related breathing disorders, insomnia, or epilepsy/sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).
Thus, by understanding both the strengths and limitations of the various techniques used to quantify heart rate variability, the authors hope that this brief monograph will provide sufﬁcient knowledge so that these indices can be used appropriately in the clinic not only to identify high risk patients but also to aid in the development of more effective therapies to treat the diseases that elicited the HRV changes.

CLINICAL APPLICATIONS HRV analysis has become an increasing important diagnostic tool in cardiology. For example, Lombardi and Stein (2011) review the relationship between HRV and heart rate turbulence (HRT, baroreceptor reﬂex mediated short-term oscillations in the heart period that occur after spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias) and “sympatho-vagal” balance while Zuern et al. (2011) and Huikuri and Stein (2012) evaluate HRV and HRT as tools for risk assessment in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. Non-linear indices of HRV are evaluated by Perkiömäki (2011) and Glass et al. (2011). Perkiömäki (2011) reports that novel HRV indices that quantify the non-linear dynamics of HR may have a greater prognostic value to identify patients with the greatest risk for adverse cardiovascular events than do conventional HRV indices, while Glass et al. (2011) analyzed the dynamic properties of premature ventricular complexes to reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for these arrhythmias.
In a similar fashion, Papaioannou et al. (2013) investigated the association between changes in HRV and the inﬂammatory response in patients with cardiovascular diseases by assessing the relationship of inﬂammatory biomarkers such as CRP, TNF-a, IL6, or white blood cell count with different parameters of HRV. Bravi et al. (2013) further explored the different changes in HRV produced by physiological and pathological stress. Datasets of healthy subjects performing physiological exercise (physiological stress) were compared to those of patients who developed sepsis after a bone marrow transplant (pathological stress), showing similar responses during both conditions, however, with subtle differences. In another chapter, Jelinek et al. (2013) evaluated cardiac rehabilitation (CR) outcomes following a 6-week program of percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCI) and coronary

Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R–R interval – the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal ﬂuctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration – the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reﬂect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Brieﬂy, pulse rate was ﬁrst measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the “Physician’s Pulse Watch” (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the ﬁrst to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the ﬁrst to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.

INTRODUCTION Heart rate variability (HRV), beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R–R interval – the heart period (for an example see Figure 1), has become an important risk assessment tool. A reduced HRV is associated with a poorer prognosis for a wide range of clinical conditions while, conversely, robust periodic changes in R–R interval are often a hallmark of health (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Bigger, 1997; De Jong and Randall, 2005; Thayler et al., 2010). A major portion of these temporal changes in heart rate occur synchronous with respiration [heart rate increases (R–R interval shortens) during inspiration and decreases (R–R interval prolongs) during expiration] and, therefore, are referred to as the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Although HRV and RSA are not quite the same, these terms are often used interchangeably and both are widely believed to reﬂect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. The exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate (Parati et al., 2006). It is the purpose of this essay to provide

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW A summary of some of the major events in the evolution of the HRV concept is displayed as a timeline (not drawn to scale) in Figure 2. Undoubtedly early humans were the ﬁrst to notice that the heart beat varied, increasing, for example, during physical exertion or sexual arousal. However, the ﬁrst written descriptions of heart rate (measured by the pulse) are found in the fragmentary writings of the ancient Greek physician and scientist Herophilos (´Hρóϕιλoς, Latinized as Herophilus, ca. 335- ca. 280 BC; Figure 3; Bedford, 1951; Bay and Bay, 2010). He was born in Chalcedon but spent the majority of his adult life in Alexandria. He was perhaps the ﬁrst anatomist and published at least nine volumes of his ﬁndings, all of which have been lost (Bedford, 1951; Bay and Bay, 2010). Fortunately, his original text was extensively quoted in the works of other authors, particularly by the GrecoRoman physician Galen (Bedford, 1951; Boylan, 2007). Among his most notable ﬁndings was the demonstration that the veins carried blood, that veins and arteries were distinctly different, and that the arteries pulsed rhythmically (Bedford, 1951; Bay and Bay, 2010). These fragmentary quotations also suggest that Herophilos was the ﬁrst person to measure heart rate (by timing the pulse

using a water clock or clepsydra; Bedford, 1951; Bay and Bay, 2010). Galen also extensively cites and criticizes the description of the pulse made by Archigenes (´Aρχιε´νης, ﬂ. ﬁrst century AD, born in Syria but practiced medicine in Rome; Bedford, 1951). Archigenes apparently described eight characteristics of the pulse, including observations on its regularity and irregularity (Bedford, 1951). The ﬁrst individual by whom the original texts on the pulse have survived is Rufus of Ephesus (ﬂ second century; Bedford, 1951). He was the ﬁrst to recognize that the pulse was caused by the contraction and relaxation of the heart (Bedford, 1951).
Irrefutably, the most inﬂuential ancient physician/scientist was Galen of Pergamon (Γαληνóς, Latinized as Claudius Galenus, 131–200 AD; Figure 4). He wrote at least 18 books on the pulse including at least 8 treatises that described using pulse for the diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of disease (Bedford, 1951; Boylan, 2007). His teaching on pulse dominated medical practice for almost sixteen centuries through the Middles Ages and the Renaissance to dawn of modern era. Among his many ﬁndings, he was the ﬁrst to report on the effects of exercise on pulse. For example, in “The Pulse for Beginners” he states:
“Exercise to begin with – and so long as it is practiced in moderation – renders the pulse vigorous large, quick, and frequent. Large amounts of exercise, which exceed the capacity of the individual, make it small, faint, quick and extremely frequent.”
(Galen, 1997, p. 332)

It was not until the early eighteenth century that the more accurate measurement of time allowed for more quantitative evaluations of heart rate. John Floyer (1649–1734), an English physician, is credited with inventing what he called the “The Physician Pulse Watch,” a portable clock that added a second hand and push-piece that could stop the watch (Floyer, 1707, 1710). Using this device, he tabulated both pulse and respiration under a variety of conditions. He published his ﬁndings in two volumes (Floyer, 1707, 1710) and became a strong advocate of using the timing of the pulse so that “we may know the natural pulse and the excesses and defects from this in disease” (Floyer, 1707, p.13).
With the increased availability of accurate time-pieces, periodic ﬂuctuations in the arterial pulse were soon described. In 1733, the Rev. Stephen Hales (1677–1761; Figure 5) was the ﬁrst to report that the beat-to-beat interval and arterial pressure level varied during the respiratory cycle (Hales, 1733). In 1847, Carl Ludwig (1816–1895; Figure 6) using his invention, the smoked drum kymograph (a device that allowed for the measurement of mechanical activity), was the ﬁrst to record periodic oscillations in the amplitude and timing of the arterial pressure waves that varied during the respiration (Ludwig, 1847). Using the dog, he noted that pulse regularly increased during inspiration and slowed during expiration, thereby providing the ﬁrst documented report of what subsequently became know as the RSA (Ludwig, 1847). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Willem Einthoven (1860–1927), using galvanometers to measure accurately changes in electrical currents, produced the ﬁrst continuous recordings of the electrical activity of the heart (Einthoven, 1895; Katz and Hellerstein, 1982; Hurst, 1998). With the development and standardization of the electrocardiogram, it

became possible to evaluate beat-to-beat changes in the cardiac rhythm. In the early 1960s, ambulatory ECGs could be obtained over long periods of time (e.g., 24 h) using a small portable recorder developed by Norman “Jeff ” Holter (1914–1983; Holter, 1961) which further sparked the interest in understanding the relationship between beat-to-beat variation in the heart interval and disease. With the advent of modern digital signal processing techniques (Cooley and Tukey, 1965), it became possible to quantify and to analyze subtle beat-to-beat variations in cardiovascular parameters. Beginning in the early 1970s several groups applied power spectral analysis to investigate the physiological basis for the individual frequency components that compose the periodic variations in heart rate (Hyndman et al., 1971; Sayers, 1973; Chess et al., 1975; Hyndman and Gregory, 1975; Peñáz et al., 1978; Akselrod et al., 1981; Kay and Marple, 1981; Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Pomeranz et al., 1985; Myers et al., 1986; Malliani et al., 1991). Since these pioneering studies the ﬁeld has rapidly expanded. Both time and frequency and time domain techniques have been used to quantify HRV. Recently, techniques derived from the new science of deterministic “chaos” have been used to evaluate the non-linear dynamic characteristics of HRV (Goldberger and West, 1987; Denton et al., 1990; Bigger et al., 1996; Lombardi et al., 1996; Mäkikallio et al., 1997, 1999a,b; Huikuri et al., 1998, 2000, 2003; Pikkujämsä et al., 1999). Some of these methodologies will be brieﬂy discussed in a subsequent section of this essay.

The physiological basis that underlies HRV has been the subject of intensive investigation and still remains an unresolved question. In later half of nineteenth century, several investigators proposed that changes in neural activity were responsible for the periodic changes in the arterial pressure interval (Traube, 1865; Donders, 1868; Hering, 1869, 1871; Cyon, 1874; Mayer, 1876; Frédéricq, 1882). Ludwig Traube (1818–1876) proposed that “irradiation” from central neural (medullary) respiratory neurons unto the cardiovascular centers was responsible for arterial waves (Traube, 1865) while in 1871 Karl Ewald Hering (1834–1918) concluded that these periodic changes originated from the reﬂex activation of afferent ﬁbers located in the lungs (Hering, 1871). Frédéricq (1851–1935) demonstrated that arterial pressure variability continued when the lung motion ceased (by opening the chest cavity) and conversely, the RSA was eliminated by the inhibition of respiratory motor activity following hyperventilation (Frédéricq, 1882). Later, Francis A. Bainbridge (1874–1921) proposed that the RSA did not involve the nervous system but rather results from mechanical distortion of the atria due to changes in thoracic pressure during the respiratory cycle (Bainbridge, 1930). The ﬁrst

systematic evaluation of these competing hypotheses was reported by Gleb von Anrep (1891–1955) and associates (Anrep et al., 1936a,b). They performed studies in dogs that clearly demonstrated that either central respiratory neural activity or the activation of pulmonary stretch receptors could maintain RSA when the other factor was controlled (Anrep et al., 1936b). They concluded that both central and peripheral mechanisms can contribute to these beat-to-beat changes in heart rate. It has also been subsequently suggested that cyclic activation of the arterial baroreceptor, thermoregulatory control, and the renin–angiotensin system may also contribute to oscillations in heart rate (Sayers, 1973; Hyndman, 1974; Akselrod et al., 1981; Madwell et al., 1989). Despite nearly 90 years of subsequent investigation, the relative contribution of the central and peripheral mechanisms responsible for RSA (Eckberg, 2003) and its functional signiﬁcance (Hayano et al., 1996; Sin et al., 2010) remain the subject of considerable controversy and active investigation.
With regards to efferent neural contribution to periodic changes in heart rate, Franciscus C. Donders (1818–1889) suggested that the changes in heart period associated with respiration resulted from activation of the cardiac vagus nerves (Donders, 1868). This view soon gained wide-spread acceptance. By 1910, Heinrich E. Hering (1866–1948) could write that “it is known with breathing that a demonstrable lowering of heart rate . . . is indicative of the function of the vagi” (Hering, 1910). Hamlin et al. (1966) convincingly demonstrated that RSA in the dog resulted from activation of the vagal nerves, an observation that has been conﬁrmed in other mammalian species (cats: Chess et al., 1975; Yongue et al., 1982; rats: McCabe et al., 1985; Cerutti et al., 1991; horse and ponies: Hamlin et al., 1972; Rugh et al., 1992), including human (Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Selman et al., 1982; Eckberg, 1983). Sympathetic neural activation was also found to contribute signiﬁcantly periodic arterial pressure changes (Guyton and Harris, 1951; Preiss et al., 1975). Arthur C. Guyton (1919–2003) and co-workers reported that vasomotor waves occur synchronous with increases in sympathetic nerve activity (Guyton and Harris, 1951). Similarly, a strong correlation between respiration, sympathetic nerve outﬂow, and changes in arterial pressure have been reported (Preiss et al., 1975). By the early 1970s several investigators began to apply modern digital processing techniques to evaluate the relationship between the autonomic neural regulation and in subtle changes in both arterial pressure waves and heart rate (Katona et al., 1970; Hyndman et al., 1971; Sayers, 1973; Chess et al., 1975; Hyndman and Gregory, 1975; Peñáz et al., 1978). For example, Katona and Jih (1975) proposed that periodic changes in heart rate that corresponded to the respiration could be used as noninvasive maker of cardiac parasympathetic regulation. A multitude of studies have been performed since these pioneering studies were competed nearly 40 years ago (for reviews see: Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Bigger, 1997; Cohen and Taylor, 2002; Grossman and Taylor, 2007; Thayler et al., 2010). Today, it is now clear that the rhythmic changes in the heart rate at any given moment reﬂect the complex interactions between parasympathetic nerve ﬁbers (activation decreases heart rate), sympathetic nerve ﬁbers

(activation increases heart rate), mechanical, and other factors on the pacemaker cells usually located in the sinoatrial node.
HEART RATE VARIABILITY TECHNIQUES A number of techniques have now been developed to quantify this beat-to-beat variability in order to provide indices of cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Bigger, 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Grossman and Taylor, 2007; Thayler et al., 2010). There are two primary approaches for the analysis of HRV: time domain and frequency domain methods (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007). The time domain measures of this variability are easier to calculate but tend to provide less detailed information than the frequency domain approaches. The time domain methods employ either statistical or geometric approaches (Table 1). Each approach shares the common feature that either heart rate at any point in time (instantaneous heart rate) or the intervals between successive normal beats are determined from a continuous ECG record. Only the normal QRS complexes are used for the calculation; that is, only beats that result from the normal electrical activation pattern (i.e., depolarization originating from the sinoatrial node) are included, any abnormal beats (atrial or ventricular arrhythmias) are excluded. Thus, the normal-to-normal (NN)

interval (the interval between adjacent normal QRS complexes) or the instantaneous heart rate (heart rate calculated on a beat by beat basis) is determined and simple descriptive time domain variables such as the mean NN interval, mean heart rate, and the range (longest NN minus the shortest NN) for a given time interval can be calculated (Kleiger et al., 1987). More detailed information is provided by the statistical analysis of a continuous sequence of normal beats (NN interval) for the time period of interest. Due to the ease of calculation, the SD (i.e., the square root of the variance) of the NN interval (SDNN) is one of the most widely used time domain indices of HRV (Kleiger et al., 1987). This calculation measures the total variability that arises from both periodic and random sources (equivalent to total power as determined by frequency domain spectral analysis). Artifact recognition also can inﬂuence time domain measurements of HRV (Malik et al., 1993). As such, these approaches cannot differentiate between the various factors that contribute to the total variance. Other approaches to quantify RSA involves obtaining the difference between the peak and the valley (or trough) of heart rate that occurs during a respiratory cycle (for each inspiration and expiration; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg, 1983; Fouad et al., 1984) or determining the number of adjacent pairs of normal beats that differ by more than 50 ms, NN50 (Ewing et al., 1984). The peak-to-valley techniques attempt to extract periodic variability from a baseline heart rate. If the amplitude of the RSA is large relative to the baseline variance of heart rate or at slower respiratory frequencies, this technique

History of HRV

provides a reasonable estimate of RSA that correlates well with other time domain indices (Grossman et al., 1990). However it is less accurate at higher respiratory frequencies and cannot quantify dynamic changes in the HRV on a beat by beat basis (Grossman et al., 1990). Other widely used statistical time domain calculations are listed in Table 1.
A series of NN intervals can also be plotted to provide a geometric pattern of the variability (Mayer-Kress et al., 1988; Malik et al., 1989; Farrell et al., 1991). Measurement of the geometric pattern (the width of the distribution) or the interpolation of a mathematically deﬁned shape such as a triangle is used to provide a measure of the HRV (Table 1). One common non-linear technique graphs the sequence of normal R–R intervals using Poincaré (return or recurrence mapping) plots, where the beat (n) is plotted against the next beat (n + 1; Woo et al., 1994; Huikuri et al., 1996; Tulppo et al., 1996). The resulting shape provides graphical display of the variability such that the greater the scatter the greater the variability.
Although time series approaches provide information about changes in the total variability, with one notable exception (see below) these techniques are less useful in identifying speciﬁc components of this variability. Beginning in the late 1960s investigators applied techniques to partition the total variability into frequency components (Hyndman et al., 1971; Sayers, 1973; Chess et al., 1975; Hyndman and Gregory, 1975; Peñáz et al., 1978; Akselrod et al., 1981; Kay and Marple, 1981; Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Pomeranz et al., 1985; Myers et al., 1986; Malliani et al., 1991; Laude et al., 1995). Power spectral density analysis produces a decomposition of the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components (i.e., how the power distributes as a function of frequency; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007). The spectral power for a given frequency can then be quantiﬁed by determining the area under the curve within a speciﬁed frequency range. The two most common spectral analysis approaches are fast Fourier transform analysis (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) modeling (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007). FFT is based upon the assumption that a time series is composed of only deterministic components while with AR the data are viewed as being composed of both deterministic and random components. For shorter duration recordings (2–5 min) three main peaks are often identiﬁed: very low frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, low frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and high frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that in infants and in response to exercise HF is shifted to a higher frequency ranges (0.24–1.04 Hz; Berntson et al., 1997). A fourth peak, ultra low frequency (ULF) 0.003–0.04 Hz), is obtained during longer recording periods (24 h). The absolute power at a given frequency is reported as ms2, but LF and HF power are often measured in normalized units (nu) obtained by dividing the frequency band of interest by total power minus VLF (in practice, since total power largely reﬂects the combination of VLF, LF, and HF; LF + HF is used as the divisor). Finally, the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF, no units) has been used as an index of the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986;

Malliani et al., 1991). However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2009) as there is considerable controversy concerning the relationship between these frequency components and a particular division of the autonomic nervous system (Kollai and Mizse, 1990; Randall et al., 1991; Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hedman et al., 1995; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Taylor et al., 2001; Parati et al., 2006; Denver et al., 2007; Grossman and Taylor, 2007; Billman, 2009).
One time domain approach can also be used to partition HRV within speciﬁc frequency bands, similar to those obtained by frequency domain techniques (Porges et al., 1980; McCabe et al., 1985; Billman and Dujardin, 1990; Denver et al., 2007). This method applies a moving polynomial to the heart period (R–R interval) time series to remove slow trends from the data (Porges et al., 1980; McCabe et al., 1985; Billman and Dujardin, 1990; Denver et al., 2007). A speciﬁed bandpass ﬁlter is then applied to the detrended data to remove all variance outside of the target frequency band. The variance of the residual data set then provides an estimate of the HRV within the target frequency band (Porges et al., 1980; McCabe et al., 1985; Billman and Dujardin, 1990; Denver et al., 2007). This procedure provides a time domain equivalent of spectral analysis with two important advantages; relatively short sequences of beats are required for calculation of the variance within the bandwidth of interest and the “moving ﬁlter” allows for the extraction of the RSA from non-stationary baselines Porges et al., 1980; McCabe et al., 1985; Billman and Dujardin, 1990; Denver et al., 2007). Thus, this technique can investigate the dynamic regulation of HRV in response to physiological challenges such as exercise, its onset, and its termination (Billman and Hoskins, 1989; Halliwill et al., 1998; Houle and Billman, 1999; Smith et al., 2005; Billman, 2006a,b; Billman and Kukielka, 2007), or myocardial ischemia (Collins and Billman, 1989; Halliwill et al., 1998; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman and Kukielka, 2006).
As was previously noted, non-linear dynamic analysis approaches as derived from Chaos Theory have also been used to evaluate HRV. It is beyond the scope of the present essay to provide a detailed history of the development of this exciting new branch of science (for an outstanding non-technical account see Gleick, 1987). However, a brief discussion of some of the central tenets of Chaos Theory is merited.
Chaos is perhaps a less than ideal word choice, as in common usage this word conveys a sense of total disorder, unpredictability, and instability. Chaos Theory describes something entirely different: an underlying order in a seemingly randomly varying sequence of events. Truly random behavior never repeats itself, it is unpredictable and disorganized while, in contrast, periodic behavior always repeats in a predictable way over some ﬁnite time interval. One might say that chaos falls somewhere between total randomness and monotonically repeating periodic behavior and has characteristics of both: an apparent randomness that emerges as a consequence of a deterministic process. There is method found in the madness. A chaotic system exhibits aperiodic behavior with a subtle but regular pattern. The behavior never quite repeats itself exactly and is constrained within a range of values. Thus, the system is stable; it does not wander off into inﬁnity as would a random

system. Deterministic chaos is non-linear, such that small changes in initial conditions lead to large changes with reiteration and also in that a single value y can be associated with more than one value of x (known mathematically as folded non-linearity; Denton et al., 1990). It is this ambiguity that gives rise to the “chaos.” In biological systems, deterministic chaos promotes the stability (variation within limits) and ﬂexibility (more than one value of x for each y) that allows an organism to maintain an optimal internal environment as it adapts to changing external demands, a new “wisdom of the body” that updates our concept of homeostasis (West, 2010). Lorenz (1963) was the ﬁrst to describe deterministic aperiodic behavior in a weather simulation model (Figure 7). He recognized that exceedingly small changes in initial conditions eventually resulted in totally different weather patterns, an observation that has become know as the butterﬂy effect (i.e., a butterﬂy ﬂapping its wings in China produces tornados in Kansas).
Beginning in the 1980s, evidence began to accumulate that strongly indicated that heart rate was the not the product of a regular periodic oscillator (a sine wave generator) but rather displayed complex non-linear dynamic behavior (Guevara et al., 1981; Goldberger and West, 1987). As a consequence, simple statistical approaches to analyze heart rate time series may lack the sensitivity necessary to detect subtle non-linear changes in HRV. Therefore, analytical approaches based upon Chaos Theory and

fractal mathematics have been employed to evaluate HRV (Goldberger and West, 1987; Denton et al., 1990; Bigger et al., 1996; Lombardi et al., 1996; Mäkikallio et al., 1997, 1999a,b; Huikuri et al., 1998, 2000, 2003; Pikkujämsä et al., 1999). These techniques do not measure the HRV magnitude but provide an estimate of its complexity. The most common methods evaluate fractal-like properties of the heart rate time series. For example, the heart rate frequency (f) spectrum exhibits an inverse power law relationship (1/f; Saul et al., 1987; Bigger et al., 1996; Huikuri et al., 1998, 2000; Mäkikallio et al., 1999a,b; Pikkujämsä et al., 1999) that is a deﬁning characteristic of fractal regulatory networks (Bassingthwaighte et al., 1994). The slope of the relationship between (log) frequency and (log) spectral density (power) from 10−4 to 10−2 Hz (an analysis of 1/f characteristics) was steeper in post-myocardial infarction and cardiac transplant patients than in healthy subjects and provided an excellent predictor of mortality following infarction (Bigger et al., 1996). These non-linear HRV measures were often better at predicting adverse cardiovascular events then were traditional markers of HRV (Bigger et al., 1996; Huikuri et al., 1998).
There are several other non-linear methods that have been used to evaluate HRV (Denton et al., 1990; Goldberger, 1990; Skinner et al., 1993; Pincus and Goldberger, 1994; Iyengar et al., 1996; Ho et al., 1997; Voss et al., 1998; Mäkikallio et al., 2001a,b; Perkiömäki et al., 2001a,b,c; Jokinen et al., 2003; Tulppo et al., 2005; Laito et al., 2006; Tuzcu et al., 2006; Perkiömäki, 2011). For example, detrended ﬂuctuation analysis is a technique that detects the presence or the absence of fractal properties in R–R interval time series (Peng et al., 1995; Iyengar et al., 1996; Mäkikallio et al., 1999b, 2001b; Pikkujämsä et al., 1999; Perkiömäki et al., 2001a,c; Tulppo et al., 2005). Altered fractal properties have been shown to precede the onset of lethal cardiac arrhythmias; changes that traditional markers of HRV failed to detect (Mäkikallio et al., 1999b). In a similar manner, multiscale (Norris et al., 2008a,b) or approximate entropy (Pincus and Viscarello, 1992; Fleisher et al., 1993; Richman and Moorman, 2000 have been used to measure of the complexity of the system, that unlike other techniques (e.g., Lyapunov exponent, Wolf et al., 1985; Denton et al., 1990) can be applied to short data sets (Pincus and Viscarello, 1992; Richman and Moorman, 2000).

SOME LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS Although it is beyond the scope of the present review to analyze extensively the strengths and weaknesses of the various indices used to measure HRV, a brief discussion of some of the limitations with these techniques is merited. For a more detailed presentation the reader is encouraged to read one or more of the review articles that eloquently address the technical issues concerning the HRV and its relationship to cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Bigger, 1997; Eckberg, 1997; Parati et al., 2006; Denver et al., 2007).
Respiratory parameters can profoundly alter heart rate and R–R interval variability independent of changes in cardiac autonomic regulation (i.e., against a constant background level of automatic regulation; Peñáz, 1957; Koepchen and Thurau, 1959; Angelone

and Coulter, 1964; Davies and Neilson, 1967; Hainsworth, 1974; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993). It is now well established that increases in respiratory frequency reduce the amplitude of heart rate oscillations (Peñáz, 1957; Angelone and Coulter, 1964; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993) while either increases in tidal (Koepchen and Thurau, 1959; Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg, 1983; Kollai and Mizse, 1990; Brown et al., 1993) or static lung volume (Hainsworth, 1974) provoke increases in the R–R interval variability. Conversely, reductions in respiratory frequency increase HRV (Peñáz, 1957; Angelone and Coulter, 1964; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993) while decreases in tidal volume lead to reductions in the R–R interval variability (Koepchen and Thurau, 1959; Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg, 1983; Kollai and Mizse, 1990; Brown et al., 1993). Thus, it is critical to control breathing (paced or timed breathing) in order to interpret HRV data accurately. For obvious reasons, it is much more difﬁcult to control respiratory parameters in conscious animal than in human studies. However, these respiratory parameters frequently are not controlled even in human studies (Brown et al., 1993). Brown et al. (1993), reviewed the human literature and found that only about 51% controlled respiratory rate, and even fewer studies controlled for tidal volume (11%). They further reported that respiratory parameters not only altered HF power but also strongly inﬂuenced the LF components of the R–R interval power spectrum, a component that previously was viewed to vary independently of changes in respiration (Brown et al., 1993).
It also must be emphasized that HRV only provides an indirect assessment of cardiac autonomic activity and does not provide a direct measurement of either cardiac parasympathetic or sympathetic nerve activity. Thus, any relationship between HRV and cardiac autonomic regulation is qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. In other words, a low or high amount of HRV may reﬂect a decreased or increased cardiac autonomic regulation but does not provide a quantiﬁcation of the actual cardiac nerve ﬁring rate. Furthermore and as previously noted, there is considerable debate as to the exact relationship between changes in cardiac autonomic activity and a particular branch of the autonomic nervous system (Kollai and Mizse, 1990; Randall et al., 1991; Kingwell et al., 1994; Hedman et al., 1995; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Taylor et al., 2001; Parati et al., 2006; Denver et al., 2007; Grossman and Taylor, 2007; Billman, 2009). For example, frequency domain analysis of HRV usually reveals two or more peaks, a LF (<015 Hz), and a higher frequency peak (>0.15 Hz) that are often assumed to correspond to cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic neural activity, respectively (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991). However, accumulating evidence clearly demonstrates this assumption is naïve and greatly oversimpliﬁes the complex non-linear interactions between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. This is particularly true with regards to the relationship between LF power and cardiac sympathetic regulation (Randall et al., 1991; Kingwell et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Parati et al., 2006; Billman, 2009).

Low frequency power was found to be reduced by selective parasympathectomy and also was not totally eliminated when the denervation was combined with beta-adrenoceptor blockade (Randall et al., 1991). Furthermore, interventions that would be expected to increase cardiac sympathetic activity, such as acute exercise or myocardial ischemia, not only failed to increase LF power but actually provoked signiﬁcant reductions this variable (Houle and Billman, 1999). Thus, LF component of HRV reﬂects both sympathetic, parasympathetic and other as yet unidentiﬁed factors. Accordingly, LF power should not be used as an index of cardiac sympathetic regulation.
Although the vast majority of the clinical and the experimental studies demonstrate a strong association between HF power and cardiac parasympathetic activity (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Bigger, 1997; Billman, 2009; Thayler et al., 2010), this concept has also been challenged (Kollai and Mizse, 1990; Hedman et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 2001; Parati et al., 2006). Just as parasympathetic activation exerts profound inﬂuences on the LF component of HRV, sympathetic neural activity may modulate the HF component of the R–R interval variability (Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002). Taylor et al. (2001) found that cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (drugs that should not indirectly alter vagal outﬂow via action within the central nervous system) increased RSA amplitude over a wide range of respiratory frequencies (i.e., the increases were not restricted to lower frequencies, <0.15 Hz). They concluded that “cardiac sympathetic outﬂow can oppose vagally mediated R-R interval oscillations and sympathetic blockade removes this effect ” (Cohen and Taylor, 2002). Thus, differences in cardiac sympathetic activation during a physiological challenge (e.g., exercise or postural changes) in healthy subjects or that occur as consequence of cardiovascular disease (following myocardial infarction) could restrain vagally mediated changes HRV. These data further demonstrate that HRV is a complex phenomenon that should not be solely attributed to changes in cardiac vagal efferent nerve trafﬁc.
In addition to autonomic inﬂuences, a portion of the HRV occurs as a consequence of the mechanical events (due to stretch of the atria that results from both changes in cardiac ﬁlling and the changing thoracic pressure that occur during respiration) as was ﬁrst proposed by Bainbridge (1930). This conclusion is supported by the observation that heart transplant patients, despite the absence of cardiac nerves, still exhibit small (∼2–8% of normal) change in R–R interval associated with the respiratory cycle (Bernardi et al., 1989). Taylor et al. (2001) further demonstrated that atrial stretch can exert signiﬁcant inﬂuences on R–R interval in subjects with complete autonomic blockade. They found that after combined cholinergic and adrenergic receptor blockade slow deep breathing could still provoke oscillations of ∼120 ms in healthy human subjects (Taylor et al., 2001). Thus, given the complex interactions between cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic nerves that are confounded by the mechanical effects of respiration, HRV data should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

History of HRV

CLINICAL APPLICATIONS Heart rate variability has gained wide-spread acceptance as a clinical tool for the evaluation of cardiac autonomic changes in patients (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Bigger, 1997; Hohnloser et al., 1997; Billman, 2009; Thayler et al., 2010). The term “HRV” yields nearly 14,000 “hits” when placed in the pubmed search engine. A variety of cardiovascular risk factors and disease states have all been shown to reduce HRV, including diabetes (Murray et al., 1975; Ewing et al., 1985; Vinik et al., 2003; Rosengard-Barlund et al., 2009), smoking (Mancia et al., 1997; Karakaya et al., 2007), obesity (Skrapari et al., 2007), Work stress (Thayler et al., 2010), hypertension (Pagani et al., 1984; Pagani and Lucini, 2001; Maule et al., 2008), and heart failure (Saul et al., 1988; Binkley et al., 1991; Woo et al., 1994; Adamopoulos et al., 1995; Kiilavuori et al., 1995; De Jong and Randall, 2005).
Eppinger and Hess (1915) provide the ﬁrst suggestion that HRV could be used to provide some insight in abnormalities in autonomic regulation in disease. They wrote “clinical facts, such as respiratory arrhythmia, habitual bradycardia, etc. have furnished the means of drawing our attention to variation in the tonus of the vagal system” (Eppinger and Hess, 1915, p. 12). They further emphasized that pharmacological manipulation of the cholinergic system might provide an avenue for treatment (Eppinger and Hess, 1915). However, the ﬁrst reports of the applications of HRV in the clinic only began to appear in the mid 1960s. Hon and Lee (1965) noted that fetal stress was preceded by reduction in the inter-beat interval even before any appreciable change in average heart rate could be detected. Fetal heart rate monitoring has now become the standard of care and has contributed to reductions in morbidity associated with fetal distress. In the 1970s, Ewing and co-workers used short-term changes in R–R interval in response to simple autonomic challenges to detect autonomic neuropathy in diabetic patients (Murray et al., 1975; Ewing et al., 1985).
About the same time, Wolf was the ﬁrst to demonstrate a relationship between HRV and mortality following myocardial infarction (Wolf et al., 1978). This observation has subsequently been conﬁrmed (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Bigger, 1997; Hohnloser et al., 1997; Thayler et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally, HRV is reduced in patients recovering from a myocardial infarction and, further, those patients with the greatest reduction in this variable also have the greatest risk for sudden death (Myers et al., 1986; Kleiger et al., 1987; Farrell et al., 1991; Bigger et al., 1992). Kleiger and co-workers (Myers et al., 1986; Kleiger et al., 1987; Bigger et al., 1992) found that in patients recovering

from myocardial infarctions, those with the smallest HRV (SD of R–R interval) had the greatest risk of dying suddenly. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times greater in patients with R–R interval variability less than 50 ms compared to patients with variability greater than 100 ms (Kleiger et al., 1987). This ﬁnding has been subsequently conﬁrmed by numerous more recent clinical studies; reductions in HRV following myocardial infarction now represent one of the strongest independent predictors of mortality following infraction. (La Rovere et al., 1988, 1998; Malik et al., 1989; Mazzuero et al., 1992; Huikuri et al., 1996; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Bigger, 1997; Hohnloser et al., 1997; Lanza et al., 1998). To cite just one example, La Rovere et al. (1988, 1998), reporting for the ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reﬂexes After Myocardial Infarction) group, found that postmyocardial infarction patients with either low HRV or a small heart rate response to an increase in blood pressure (i.e., baroreceptor reﬂex sensitivity) had a much greater risk of sudden death than those with well preserved cardiac vagal tone. The greatest risk for mortality was observed in patients with a large reduction in both markers of cardiac vagal regulation (La Rovere et al., 1998).
Similar results have also been obtained using animal model of human disease (Billman, 2006a). For example, HRV was reduced to a greater extent in animals susceptible to ventricular ﬁbrillation as compared to animals resistant to these malignant arrhythmias (Billman and Hoskins, 1989; Collins and Billman, 1989; Halliwill et al., 1998; Houle and Billman, 1999; Smith et al., 2005; Billman, 2006a,b; Billman and Kukielka, 2006). In particular, the susceptible animals exhibited a much greater reduction (withdrawal) of cardiac vagal regulation in response to either submaximal exercise (Billman and Hoskins, 1989; Halliwill et al., 1998; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2006a,b; Billman and Kukielka, 2006) or acute myocardial ischemia (Collins and Billman, 1989; Halliwill et al., 1998; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2006a; Billman and Kukielka, 2006). Heart rate recovery and the reactivation of cardiac parasympathetic regulation following the termination of exercise were also impaired in the animals subsequently shown to prone to ventricular ﬁbrillation (Smith et al., 2005; Billman and Kukielka, 2007); an observation that has been noted in patients. For example, post-infarction patient with the slowest heart rate recovery following an exercise stress test also exhibited the highest mortality rate during the observation period (up to 12 years; Cole et al., 1999, 2000; Nishime et al., 2000; Morshedi-Meibodi et al., 2002; Nissinen et al., 2003; Jouven et al., 2005). Thus, despite the limitations noted in a previous section, HRV has proven to be an important tool for the identiﬁcation of patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.

Heart period constantly changes on a beat to beat basis, due to autonomic inﬂuences on the sinoatrial node, and changes can be quantiﬁed as heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, after a premature ventricular beat, there are reproducible variations in RR interval, also due to baroreﬂex mediated autonomic inﬂuences on the sinoatrial node, that can be measured as heart rate turbulence (HRT). Impaired autonomic function as measured by HRV and HRT has proven to predict adverse outcomes in clinical settings. The ability of reduced HRV and HRT to predict adverse outcomes has been explained by their dependency on vagal mechanisms that could reﬂect an increased sympathetic and a reduced vagal modulation of sinus node, thus favoring cardiac electrical instability. Analysis of non-linear dynamics of HRV has also been utilized to describe the fractal like characteristic of the variability signal and proven effective in identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Despite the clinical validity of these measures, it has also been evident that the relationship between neural input and sinus node responsiveness is extremely complex and variable in different clinical conditions. Thus, abnormal HRV or HRT on a clinical Holter recordings may reﬂect non-neural as well as autonomic mechanisms, and this also needs to be taken into account when interpreting any ﬁndings. However, under controlled conditions, the computation of the low and high frequency components of HRV and of their normalized powers or ratio seems capable of providing valid information on sympatho-vagal balance in normal subjects, as well as in most patients with a preserved left ventricular function. Thus, analysis of HRV does provide a unique tool to speciﬁcally assess autonomic control mechanisms in association with various perturbations. In conclusion, HRV measures are of substantial utility to identify patients with an increased cardiac mortality and to evaluate autonomic control mechanisms, but their ability to capture speciﬁc levels of autonomic control may be limited to controlled laboratory studies in relatively healthy subjects.
Keywords: autonomic modulation, sympathetic and vagal control, baroreﬂex mechanisms, spectral analysis, non-invasive evaluation of cardiac function

HEART RATE VARIABILITY Heart rate variability (HRV) was the ﬁrst non-invasive methodology extensively used to evaluate autonomic modulation of the sinus node in normal subjects and in patients with different cardiac and non-cardiac diseases and to identify patients at risk for an increased cardiac mortality. Since the initial report of Wolf et al. (1978) of the relationship of decreased RR variability on ECG and morality in post-MI patients, different methodologies have been developed and are now available to measure HRV in the experimental laboratory and in the clinical setting (Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). These range from simple statistical descriptors to complex nonlinear mathematical parameters. Indeed, the possibility of obtaining a non-invasive evaluation of autonomic control mechanisms has resulted in a relative broad utilization of this methodology, often in a “black box” manner, by people who have bought HRV software. However, a precise understanding of and a consensus on

the autonomic underpinnings of most HRV parameters has not been achieved.
TIME DOMAIN HRV PARAMETERS In almost all normal subjects and patients, the heart period changes on a beat to beat basis even during resting, controlled conditions. These variations, largely due to respiration and sympathetic activity are almost abolished by simultaneous parasympathetic and sympathetic blockade (Figure 1). When the recording period is prolonged to several hours and conditions are no longer tightly controlled, additional factors may inﬂuence HRV. Among important inﬂuences are: environmental factors, level and extent of physical activity, emotional stress, meal times, talking vs. silence, sleep and quality of sleep, and recording duration.
Overall variability is largely dependent on the strength of the circadian rhythm with a predominant sympathetic activity during day-time and a predominant vagal activity during night-time. These autonomic changes can be easily inferred by considering the

variation in 24 h heart rate patterns. A reduced SDNN or triangular index is generally due to failure of heart rate to decrease at night and reﬂects an impaired vagal activity. Moreover, an increased resting heart rate is often present in patients with sign of sympathetic activation. These autonomic alterations are made worse by low day-time activity levels. Thus, both a diminished vagal and an increased sympathetic modulation of the sinus node may be reﬂected by a reduction in HRV (Kleiger et al., 1987; Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Fauchier et al., 1997; Nolan et al., 1999; Rashba et al., 2006). This interpretation is in agreement with experimental evidence indicating a pro-arrhythmic effect of sympatho-excitation (Lown and Verrier, 1976) and also with the ﬁndings that a reduction of these parameters is associated with an increased cardiac mortality in almost all clinical conditions characterized by an autonomic imbalance, e.g., after myocardial infarction, in patients with heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes (Kleiger et al., 1987; Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Fauchier et al., 1997; Nolan et al., 1999; Rashba et al., 2006).
The ﬁnding that time domain parameters were inversely correlated with aging and inﬂuenced by the extent of left ventricular dysfunction made clear that the causes of reduction in HRV and the interpretation of their predictive value were more complex than originally assumed and also involved neural and non-neural mechanisms (Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
Indeed, the relationship between neural discharge, heart rate, and HRV is complex and cannot be explained by a linear model. Experimental ﬁndings, indicate (Zaza and Lombardi, 2001) that neural modulation of cycle length is rather dependent on where

on the curve they are, much as cardiac contractility is not uniform over different amounts of stretch of the cardiac muscle. Thus, although the ﬁnding of an intrinsic rate dependency of autonomic indices does not limit the prognostic value of HRV, it markedly complicates its physiological interpretation. Moreover, it has also to be considered that at the sinus node transduction level acetylcholine-mediated effects occur with a faster kinetics than those of norepinephrine, thus having a larger potential for inducing near-term variability. Although this forms the basis of measuring acetylcholine-mediated vagal control of heart rate by examining more rapid changes in cycle length, it also complicates the interpretation of slower changes. In addition two other factors need to be considered: ﬁrst, an increase in resting heart period duration may amplify the effects of any source of variability affecting the sinus node and second, that many cardiovascular drugs may directly affect the sinus pacemaker. All these factors have to be taken into account when interpreting HRV ﬁndings (Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
Time domain variables can be divided into indexes of total variability such as SDNN, SDANN, or triangular index, preferably computed on long term recordings, and beat to beat indexes such as rMSSD or pNN50 that are more speciﬁc markers of vagal/respiratory effects but are also exaggerated by subtle arrhythmias that are not of respiratory origin, especially in older populations or in subjects with underlying clinical disease. These latter parameters can also be assessed on short-term recordings and have been frequently used to evaluate alterations in vagal modulation, although unless the subjects being studied are young and healthy, veriﬁcation, by using a graphical analysis, that the measures truly reﬂect respiratory sinus arrhythmia, is suggested (Stein et al., 2005b).
FREQUENCY DOMAIN PARAMETERS Spectral analysis allows the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of the principal oscillations that characterize HRV especially during resting controlled conditions. Since the beginning, interest in this approach was driven by the possibility of correlating shortterm spectral components to neural discharge (Akselrod et al., 1981; Pagani et al., 1986; Malliani et al., 1991; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996) and of obtaining indirect information on neural modulation of the sinus node. In normal subjects under controlled conditions (Figure 2), two principal components are easily identiﬁed: a respiration-related high frequency (HF) component (0.15–0.4 Hz) and a lower frequency (LF) component (0.04–0.15 Hz) with a peak at about 0.1 Hz synchronous with the low frequency oscillations of arterial pressure (Akselrod et al., 1981; Pagani et al., 1986; Malliani et al., 1991; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). The former was considered to reﬂect phasic vagal activity triggered by respiration. The origin of LF was more controversial, being the result of more complex neural mechanisms related to sympathetic and vagal outﬂows. The LF/HF ratio has been used as an index of sympatho-vagal interaction to explore autonomic control of

sinus node during experimental intervention capable of producing reﬂex sympathetic or vagal activation (Akselrod et al., 1981; Pagani et al., 1986; Malliani et al., 1991; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). This was the case, for example, in patients during the acute phase of myocardial infarction or in the initial stages of heart failure (Akselrod et al., 1981; Pagani et al., 1986; Lombardi et al., 1987; Malliani et al., 1991; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). In these patients, values of LF/HF ratio greater than 2 were considered to reﬂect a shift of sympatho-vagal balance toward a sympathetic predominance. More controversial was the interpretation of spectral component in patients with a marked reduction of ventricular function, where in spite of clinical signs of sympathetic activation, a reduction rather than an increase in LF component is commonly observed (van de Borne et al., 1997). Different factors including an altered central pattern of discharge at vasomotor centers, a loss of rhythmicity in sympathetic outﬂow as a consequence of a reduced baroreﬂex modulation, as well as a reduced responsiveness of the sinus node to neural inputs have been repeatedly advocated as explantation without, however, deﬁnitive experimental data (Malliani et al., 1991; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Burger et al., 1997; Grassi et al., 1999).
The issue of the meaning of LF, HF, or LF/HF is even more controversial when interpreting long term recordings (Figure 3) whereas environmental factors, extent of physical activity, and quality and duration of sleep are the major determinants of HRV and these components vary signiﬁcantly over time (Malliani et al.,

1991; Bigger et al., 1992; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
In conclusion, spectral analysis of HRV must be restricted to short-term recordings under controlled conditions in order to deﬁnitely relate them to autonomic nervous system functioning. However, just as ST depression on a resting ECG is useful for ﬁnding clinical problems, a more deﬁnitive stress test

is needed to fully unmask ST depression. Similarly, short-term supine, controlled measures of HRV, which reﬂecting current autonomic status, may identify patients with extremely poor autonomic functioning but will miss autonomic abnormalities that are not present at rest. In addition, when associated with simultaneous continuous recording of arterial pressure and of respiratory activity (Pagani et al., 1986; Parati et al., 1988; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996), spectral analysis offers the unique opportunity of evaluating the effects of arterial pressure changes on heart period and to compute baroreﬂex sensitivity, an important marker of cardiovascular integration.
NON-LINEAR DYNAMICS The appraisal of the complexity of the different neural and nonneural feedback loops impacting on the sinus node and determining HRV has stimulated the search for novel indexes capable of reﬂecting the complexity and the correlation properties of the signal rather than the magnitude of variability (Goldberger, 1996; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). Indices such as the exponent β of 1/f slope for long term analysis (Goldberger, 1996; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Lombardi, 2000) or the scaling exponent α1 for short-term recordings (Peng et al., 1995; Mäkikallio et al., 2005) provide measures of fractal correlation properties of RR intervals at different time scales. These parameters do not reﬂect a speciﬁc component of autonomic modulation and therefore cannot be used to evaluate the presence of increased sympathetic activation or of a reduced vagal tone. They rather reﬂect the characteristics of heart rate behavior and, in particular, its complexity or randomness which are dependent upon the functional integrity of autonomic control mechanisms and sinus node responsiveness (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
In normal subjects the power-law slope has been reported to be equal to −1, although this assertion is yet not supported by epidemiologic data. It becomes more negative after myocardial infarction (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Lombardi, 2000) and with aging (Stein et al., 2008). In ICD recipient patients, analysis of the storage electrograms revealed a further reduction of power-law slope of slow ﬂuctuations in the minutes preceding the onset of ventricular tachycardia in comparison to control (Lombardi et al., 2000).
The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis technique quantiﬁes the relations of heart rate ﬂuctuations at different time scales. In younger populations, the short-term fractal scaling exponent α1 (or DFA1; correlations on the scale of 3–11 beats) in the 1.20–1.35 range is commonly observed. In the Cardiovascular Health study (Stein et al., 2008), DFA1 of 1.05 was the cutpoint value for risk of mortality. Lower values in post-MI studies and in CHF patients (<0.80 or 0.85, respectively) indentify patients at higher risk (Huikuri et al., 2000). The short-term

fractal scaling exponent has been particularly effective in identifying patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Mäkikallio et al., 1999, 2005; Huikuri et al., 2000; Lombardi et al., 2001; Stein et al., 2005a, 2008). The analysis of short-term fractal properties of HRV has been demonstrated to be superior to conventional HRV measures in term of prognostic value in predicting both arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic cardiac death in post myocardial infarction patients (Mäkikallio et al., 2005). Longer term DFA without correction is not very useful for risk stratiﬁcation and DFA2 (α2, correlations on the scale of 12–20 beats) has not been shown to add to risk stratiﬁcation in most situations.
Altered short-term fractal scaling exponent has also been observed to precede ventricular ﬁbrillation onset among patients who experienced this arrhythmia during Holter recordings (Mäkikallio et al., 1999).
HEART RATE TURBULENCE Whereas alterations in RR intervals induced by premature ventricular beats can affect computation of time domain parameters and the LF and HF components by increasing, respectively, overall variability as well as power in the HF range (Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996), they are the basis for heart rate turbulence (HRT) analysis.
This methodology, initially described by Schmidt et al. (1999), is based on the fact that the changes in RR intervals following a premature ventricular beat in healthy people are well-deﬁned and consist of an initial shortening followed by a progressive lengthening until there is a return to the pre-arrhythmia baseline. This pattern of changes, although not necessarily the exact magnitude, is consistent within the same subject and is the result of the interaction of complex neural control mechanisms (Bauer et al., 2008).
PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF HRT Since the original description of HRT methodology (Schmidt et al., 1999; Bauer et al., 2008), it was hypothesized that the neural reﬂexes responsible for HRT were due to two principal components: the initial acceleration was the result of a transient vagal inhibition and sympathetic activation in response to brief inhibition of baroreﬂex afferent input due to a hemodynamically inefﬁcient ventricular contraction (Lombardi et al., 1989; Schmidt et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2008). This explanation proved to be incomplete. The initial HR acceleration is a fast response phenomenon thus making unlikely that a surge in sympathetic outﬂow could play a major role. Then, after the compensatory pause, it was hypothesized that the overshoot of arterial pressure, due to increased ventricular ﬁlling, was responsible for the subsequent deceleration of heart rate through a combined sympathetic and vagal recruitment. Thus two distinct phenomena characterize HRT: the initial shortening, which is deﬁned by the term turbulence onset (TO) and the subsequent lengthening that is described by the term turbulence slope (TS; Figure 4). A more complete appraisal of HRT mechanisms, took in account the fact

Heart rate variability and turbulence

The correlation between HRT and HRV is modest, suggesting that additional neural and non-neural factors are likely to play a major role in determining variations in the parameters that describes the two methodologies and that there is potential to use them in combination to leverage the risk stratiﬁcation properties of both. In support of this, addition, the use of a combination of a decreased short-term fractal scaling exponent and abnormal HRT identiﬁed population-dwelling older adults at higher risk of cardiovascular death than the use of either parameter alone.

FIGURE 4 | Schematic representation of the RR interval changes induced by a premature ventricular contraction that are used to compute the two indexes of heart rate turbulence: turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS).
that under physiologic conditions, systolic arterial pressure progressively increases after a premature ventricular beat and reaches its maximal value within eight cardiac cycles, thus activating a spontaneous baroreﬂex mechanism, with an initial sympathetic inhibition followed by a transient predominant vagal activation (Lombardi et al., 1989; Schmidt et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2008). This explanation is supported by the ﬁnding that greatest variations in HRT indexes were observed in response to more premature spontaneous or induced ventricular contractions, which were associated with a greater fall in systolic pressure and longer compensatory pause (Davies et al., 2001; Roach et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2002; Savelieva et al., 2003; Wichterle et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2008).
Heart rate turbulence is computed as TO and TS. TO is computed (Schmidt et al., 1999; Bauer et al., 2008) by determining the percentage differences between the two sinus RR intervals following the compensatory pause (RR1 and RR2) and the two RR intervals immediately preceding the premature beat coupling interval (RR−2 and RR−1) divided by RR−2 + RR−1. The initial acceleration is therefore computed on the ﬁrst two sinus cycles following the premature ventricular beat and if there is no acceleration or an actual deceleration, both abnormal, TO is zero or positive. TS is deﬁned as the maximum regression slope measured on any 5 consecutive sinus cycles within the ﬁrst 15 sinus intervals after the compensatory pause and cannot be calculated when there are fewer than 15 sinus beats after the premature ventricular contraction. The slowing is due to a baroreﬂex mediated vagal activation and it is expressed in ms/RR interval. Computation of HRT requires at least ﬁve qualifying ventricular premature beats and TO and TS are computed from a “signal average” of the responses to all premature ventricular beats on the recording.
Both TO and TS were found to correlate with baroreﬂex sensitivity assessed by the phenylephrine method. The physiological changes in sinus cycle duration measure by HRT were abolished by vagal blockade with atropine and were almost unaffected after beta-blockade (Bauer et al., 2008).

FACTORS INFLUENCING HRT Left ventricular ejection fraction signiﬁcantly affects HRT parameters. In patients with structural heart disease and depressed left ventricular function, HRT indexes are markedly depressed as a result of mechanical and autonomic factors: the enhanced post-extrasystolic potentiation and the altered autonomic pattern with signs of sympathetic activation and reduced vagal modulation account for such a ﬁnding (Bauer et al., 2008). However, a recent study showed that abnormal values for HRT identify older adults who are considered to be healthy by multiple measures of cardiovascular function including HRV, but who were, in fact, at almost eight times greater risk of cardiovascular death on follow up than healthy older adults with normal HRT (Stein and Barzilay, 2011).
Aging is also associated with a reduction of HRT parameters in a manner similar to most autonomic indexes. Finally HRT is reduced at higher heart rate, as a result of either a baseline sympathetic activation or of a heart rate dependency associated with the non-linear relationship between sinus node properties and vagal neural activity (Schwab et al., 2004; Bauer et al., 2008).
CONCLUSION Heart rate variability and HRT are two non-invasive ECG-based techniques capable of providing relevant information on the autonomic modulation of the sinus node. They can be considered as complementary, taking into account that HRV mainly reﬂects the continuous interaction between neural modulatory mechanism and sinus node function while HRT can be considered a physiological stimulus–response test in which sinus node function and autonomic modulatory activity are perturbed by a transient stimulus either occurring spontaneously or induced by programmed electric stimulation.
The predictive value of these methodologies will be discussed in the next section. Of clinical relevance is the ﬁnding that depressed values for both HRV and HRT indexes are commonly observed in those clinical conditions associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Bauer et al., 2008, 2009). Finally, the association between a reduced SDNN and markers of subclinical inﬂammation suggests that reduced vagal activity may mediate inﬂammation which opens new perspectives, not only for a better understanding on the physiopathological mechanisms responsible for cardiac mortality, but also for the identiﬁcation of high-risk patients by combining autonomic with inﬂammatory markers (Lombardi, 2004; Stein and Barzilay, 2011).

This paper reviews the methods used for editing of the R–R interval time series and how this editing can inﬂuence the results of heart rate (HR) variability analyses. Measurement of HR variability from short and long-term electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings is a non-invasive method for evaluating cardiac autonomic regulation. HR variability provides information about the sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic balance. One important clinical application is the measurement of HR variability in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. However, HR variability signals extracted from R–R interval time series from ambulatory ECG recordings often contain different amounts of artifact. These false beats can be either of physiological or technical origin. For instance, technical artifact may result from poorly fastened electrodes or be due to motion of the subject. Ectopic beats and atrial ﬁbrillation are examples of physiological artifact. Since ectopic and other false beats are common in the R–R interval time series, they complicate the reliable analysis of HR variability sometimes making it impossible. In conjunction with the increased usage of HR variability analyses, several studies have conﬁrmed the need for different approaches for handling false beats present in the R–R interval time series.The editing process for the R–R interval time series has become an integral part of these analyses. However, the published literature does not contain detailed reviews of editing methods and their impact on HR variability analyses. Several different editing and HR variability signal pre-processing methods have been introduced and tested for the artifact correction. There are several approaches available, i.e., use of methods involving deletion, interpolation or ﬁltering systems. However, these editing methods can have different effects on HR variability measures. The effects of editing are dependent on the study setting, editing method, parameters used to assess HR variability, type of study population, and the length of R–R interval time series. The purpose of this paper is to summarize these pre-processing methods for HR variability signal, focusing especially on the editing of the R–R interval time series.

INTRODUCTION Heart rate (HR) variability quantiﬁes the ﬂuctuations in the time intervals between individual heart beats. HR variability can be easily obtained, e.g., from Holter recordings, which is a non-invasive technique and has a relatively good reproducibility. The analysis of HR variability can provide insights into autonomic nervous function and provide information about the sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic balance and cardiovascular health (Malik and Camm, 1995; Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996).
Numerous studies have been published during the last three decades about HR variability in many pathological conditions or during exercise or different physiological conditions. Analyses of HR variability have been considered as a way of quantifying the risk of different arrhythmic events or even death in conjunction with cardiac and non-cardiac disorders (Kleiger et al., 1987, 2005; Saul et al., 1988; Bigger et al., 1992; Nolan et al., 1998; Yoshikawa et al., 1999; Aronson and Burger, 2000; Huikuri et al., 2000; Malik et al., 2000; La Rovere et al., 2003; Aronson et al., 2004; Camm

et al., 2004; Kataoka et al., 2004; Mäkikallio et al., 2005; Stein et al., 2005).
However, in most cases HR variability signals are imperfect, since they contain disturbances of technical or physiological origins. For instance, technical artifact may result from poorly fastened electrodes or be due to movement of the subject resulting missing beats or beats whose onset cannot be clearly identiﬁed. Premature beats (ectopic beats) and atrial ﬁbrillation are examples of physiological artifact. Ectopic beats introduce a bias into HR variability results and represent a signiﬁcant problem in the interpretation of these results (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997). For example, ectopic beats in R–R interval time series impair the reliability of the HR variability power spectrum by introducing false frequency components into the power spectrum. As HR variability analyses have become more popular, the need for and importance of artifact correction have been emphasized (Laguna et al., 1996; Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996; Salo et al., 2001; Mateo and Laguna, 2003; Thuraisingham, 2006; Tarkiainen et al., 2007; Sassi and Mainardi, 2008; Colak,

Editing of R–R intervals

2009; Kumaravel and Santhi, 2010). Several pre-processing methods for HR variability signal have been introduced. For example, pre-processing can involve editing of artifact by deletion, interpolations, or ﬁltering. However, these different editing methods may have their own distinct effects on HR variability results and one could end up with different values if the R–R interval time series have been edited by deletion or interpolation. This paper reviews the pre-processing methods for R–R interval time series as part of HR variability analysis. The main focus is to describe the common editing methods for R–R interval time series and how they inﬂuence the results of the analysis. In addition, common false beats occurring in R–R interval time series are described.
BACKGROUND OF HR VARIABILITY The normal heart rhythm is deﬁned by the rate of sinus node depolarization. Sinus rhythm oscillates around the mean HR, which is dependent on continuous regulation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The main components of the ANS are the vagal (parasympathetic) and sympathetic centers in the central nervous system and thus the HR represents the balance of the inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagus) nerves. Parasympathetic activity has decelerating effects on the HR and correspondingly sympathetic activity elevates the HR. The dynamic balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic activity causes a continuous oscillation of the HR – this is called HR variability (Levy and Martin, 1979). Under resting conditions, parasympathetic activity is dominant and the ﬂuctuations in HR are mainly controlled by changes in parasympathetic activity (Levy, 1971; Chess et al., 1975). HR variability can be used as a window into the cardiorespiratory control system and as a tool for examining the ﬂuctuations of the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the ANS but interpretation of the results depends on the conditions under which the recording was obtained and the length of the recording itself. HR variability measures have been postulated to describe the complex interaction between the ANS and HR and their modulation by many physiological factors.
Heart rate variability can be analyzed by different methods, which are usually categorized as time domain methods, frequencydomain methods, and methods based on the non-linear dynamics of HR. HR variability analyses are performed using R–R interval time series obtained from continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) recording by detecting each QRS complex. Normal-to-normal (N– N) interval time series contain only R–R intervals resulting from sinus node depolarizations.
Time domain analyses consists of various statistical parameters such as SDNN, the standard deviation of N–N beats, rMSSD, the square root of the mean squared differences of the successive N–N interval and pNN50, the percentage of differences between adjacent N–N intervals that are by more than 50 ms (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996). In addition, different geometrical approaches that utilize the sample density distribution of N–N interval durations or the sample density distribution of differences between adjacent N–N intervals have been used to examine HR variability in the time domain (Malik et al., 1989b; Farrell et al., 1991).
Heart rate variability analysis in frequency-domain entails the estimation of the power spectrum of the R–R interval time series. Power spectrum computation can be performed with parametric

or non-parametric methods. Parametric methods involve modeling the signal with an autoregressive (AR) model. Non-parametric spectrum estimation usually contains a computation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) or periodogram. Information about spectral estimates can be obtained by decomposing the spectrum of R–R interval time series into quantiﬁed frequency components or by integrating the signals over a deﬁned frequency band. Decomposition of the HR variability power spectrum provides information of how the variance is distributed as a function of frequency. Four main frequency bands are distinguished in the power spectrum of the HR variability signal, i.e.: high frequency (HF, 0.15–0.4 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz), very low frequency (VLF, 0.0033–0.04-Hz), and ultra low frequency (ULF, <0.0033 Hz) components (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996; Stein et al., 2000). Various physiological phenomena have been associated with these frequency bands (Penaz et al., 1968; Sayers, 1973; Akselrod et al., 1981; Cohen and Taylor, 2002). Power spectrum analysis of HR variability is a popular method for studying autonomic neural ﬂuctuations and it has been investigated in many studies in different patient populations and study settings. In addition, HR variability analysis in frequency domain can include computation of higher order spectrum (Chandran and Elgar, 1993) and wavelet transform (Vetterli, 1992).
In addition to conventional time and frequency-domain HR variability analysis, there are other methods based on the nonlinear system theory and beat-to-beat dynamics. Non-linear analyses include return maps, such as Poincaré plots, fractal scaling analysis (DFA analysis), different complexity measures (e.g., Lyaponov exponent, correlation dimension), and approximate entropy, for instance. The clinical utility of these non-linear HR variability analyses has been tested in various sets of R–R interval data (Skinner et al., 1991; Bigger et al., 1992, 1996; Peng et al., 1995; Lombardi et al., 1996b; Mäkikallio et al., 1996, 1999; Ho et al., 1997; Huikuri et al., 1998, 2000; Brennan et al., 2001; Berkowitsch et al., 2004; Camm et al., 2004; Carpeggiani et al., 2004). In addition, beat-to-beat dynamics can be studied with novel methods such as HR turbulence after ventricular premature beats (VPB; Schmidt et al., 1999; Bauer and Schmidt, 2003) and deceleration capacity of HR (Bauer et al., 2006).
More detailed information about the various HR variability measures and their physiological background have been reviewed previously (Cohen and Taylor, 2002; Watanabe, 2003; Reed et al., 2005; Freeman, 2006; Bansal et al., 2009; Huikuri et al., 2009; Valentini and Parati, 2009; Wheat and Larkin, 2010; Karim et al., 2011).
ASSESSMENT OF THE HR VARIABILITY SIGNAL The HR variability signal is usually obtained from an ECG recording that is captured over a certain period of time. Recording of the ECG is traditionally performed with a portable, ambulatory, electrocardiography device, a Holter monitor that enables recording of the heart rhythm continuously in outpatients although currently multiday recordings are beginning to be obtained via outpatient telemetry. Holter monitors are worn by the patients during his/her normal daily activities. Subsequently, the ECG data are uploaded to a computer for further processing and analysis. QRS complexes are detected from the ECG and the R-peak is usually used as the ﬁducial point due to its readily distinguishable amplitude. In fact,

Editing of R–R intervals

the true marker for HR is the P wave onset, since the P wave is a more accurate marker of onset of the atrial depolarization than the R-peak (Clifford, 2006). However, in most cases the amplitude of the P wave is too low and difﬁcult to detect accurately. Detection of the R-peaks is an important stage in the acquisition of the HR variability signal and requires a robust algorithm, i.e., the more accurate the R-peak detection, the less error in the R–R interval time series and in the subsequent HR variability analysis. Thus, the importance of accurate R-peak detection and high-quality software cannot be over-emphasized.
QRS complexes or R-peaks can be detected with different algorithms based for example on Hilbert transform (Benitez et al., 2001) or some other digital ﬁltering methods (Pan and Tompkins, 1985; Hamilton and Tompkins, 1986; Israel et al., 2005; Arzeno et al., 2008), pattern recognition (Mehta et al., 1996), and wavelet transform (Mehta et al., 1996; Romero et al., 2003; Abdelliche and Charef, 2009), etc. Usually these methods include a feature extraction phase and a decision phase. There can be differences in the quality between different R-peak detection methods. Problems may appear especially with ECG signals containing noise, irregular rhythm, or frequently varying morphology of the QRS complexes. The more accurate the R-peak detection method the fewer missed and false R-peaks will need to be edited in R–R interval time series (Köhler et al., 2002; Manikandan and Soman, 2012). However, currently there are no detailed or standardized recommendations in the literature about the R-peak detection methods for inclusion in HR variability analyses. High-quality R–R interval software should contain a visual view of the actual point positions in the ECG signal of the R-peak detection process and the possibility to correct any false points. The correction of false points should be performed with accurate algorithm instead of manual correction to avoid errors. More information about the QRS complex detection can be found in the review of Köhler et al. (2002).
In addition, the better the sampling frequency in the ECG recording the better the resolution of the R–R interval time series. Sampling rate is recommended to be at least 500–1000 Hz (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996). A low sampling rate may cause dispersion in the R-peak estimation and furthermore it will introduce bias into HR variability results, especially into spectrum, and some non-linear measures (Merri et al., 1990).
In order to form R–R interval time series, ﬁrst, the difference in time of each of two consecutive R intervals is computed. Next, durations of the consecutive R–R intervals are deﬁned and they form the discrete R–R interval time series, called the R–R interval tachogram or the HR variability signal. The R–R interval time series is not sampled at uniform intervals due to differences in the duration of adjacent heart beats. The fact that R–R intervals are represented as a function of time has to be taken into account, especially in the frequency-domain analysis. To avoid this issue, different approaches have been used prior to spectrum analysis. One approach is to compute the power spectrum directly from R–R interval time series available in function of the beat index. However in this approach, the spectrum is not a function of frequency but instead it is a function of cycles per beat (DeBoer et al., 1984; Baselli et al., 1987). Another approach is to resample R–R interval time series with different interpolation methods, such as spline interpolation in an attempt to distribute the non-

equidistantly sampled R–R intervals so that they are equally spaced (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996). The third approach is to use an integral pulse frequency modulation (IPFM) model. The IPFM method utilizes delta functions representing a series of impulses occurring at those times when heart beats (DeBoer et al., 1985). The generation of the R–R interval time series is illustrated in Figure 1.
ARTIFACT IN THE HR VARIABILITY SIGNAL In the ideal situation, HR variability analysis is performed with R–R interval time series including only pure sinus beats (N–N intervals). However, R–R interval time series obtained from ambulatory ECG recordings are in most cases imperfect, since they can contain a different number of abnormal beats, artifact. Abnormal R–R intervals differ from sinus rhythm in their length and they represent disturbances of both technical and physiological origins and are present in almost all Holter ECG recordings. Physiological artifacts occur especially in patients suffering from different cardiovascular diseases. For example, cardiac dysrhythmias can appear at one time or another in 90–95% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (Kamath and Fallen, 1995). If steady state conditions are maintained in a laboratory study with pre-termined duration, then it may be possible to obtain recording without artifacts, at least in healthy subjects who are not suffering from any cardiovascular disease. However, in infants or uncooperative patients or during ECG recordings lasting for several hours, it is virtually impossible to obtain steady state conditions throughout the entire recording. Therefore, artifact represent a signiﬁcant problem for the measurement of HR variability since they have impact on the reliability of the results. For example, if ectopic beats are left unedited, they may bias the HR variability power spectrum by increasing the power of higher frequency bands. Ectopic beats cause also erroneously higher values of the standard deviation of the R–R intervals (Thuraisingham, 2006). In Figure 2, an example of a short-term HR variability power spectrum including false frequency components due to ventricular ectopic is shown.
Physiological artifacts appear when disturbed electrical activity in the heart produces abnormal heart rhythms. The normal rhythm originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node. Abnormal impulse formation produces disturbances such as premature (ectopic) beats and atrial or ventricular ﬁbrillation, for instance. A premature beat of ventricular origin is known as a VPB, or a premature ventricular contraction (PVC or VPC). Correspondingly, an ectopic beat of atrial origin is known as a premature atrial contraction (PAC or SVE). These kinds of disturbances are observed in the ECG as divergent waves and QRS complexes. Disturbances in the impulse conduction can produce errors in ECG such as pauses, for example due to AV block, SA block, or variable R–R intervals due to wandering atrial pacemaker.
Almost everyone experiences ectopic beats. Ectopic beats can be common events, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease, but they can be present also in healthy subjects (Kamath and Fallen, 1995). It is possible that as many as one in every three healthy men exhibit one or more VBPs during a 1-h ECG recording (Bikkina et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the prevalence of ectopic beats will introduce a major source of error into HR variability measurement. In particular, VPBs are usually followed by a

compensatory pause, before there is a return to the pre-ectopic baseline heart rhythm. In R–R interval time series, the appearance of a VPB with a compensatory pause is seen as an R–R interval of a short duration followed by a beat with a longer duration compared to normal sinus rhythm such as shown in Figure 3. Normally, both the ectopic beat and the following compensatory pause are edited.
In addition to physiological artifact, there may also be errors attributable to the technical aspects of the ECG recording. Problems may be traced to the software used to detect R–R intervals. For example, detection algorithm may fail if the threshold for R–R interval identiﬁcation is set too low or too high. Technical artifact may also result from poorly fastened electrodes or from motion or sweating of the patient during the ECG recording. Technical artifact usually occur in larger epochs containing several consecutive false samples resembling random noise. Most of the Holter analysis software include some kind of automatic ECG recognition with the detection of QRS complexes and the classiﬁcation of beats. Beat detection may include the possibility of labeling or annotating individual beats (Malik and Camm, 1995). However, the visual scanning of different morphologies of QRS complexes and labeling individual beats can be time consuming, especially in the case of long-term ECG recordings. For this reason, both high-quality HR data pre-processing software and the presence of an experienced Holter analysis specialist is very important if one wishes to obtain reliable HR data for analysis.
EDITING OF R–R INTERVALS If the number of abnormal R–R intervals is relatively small and the artifact occurrence is infrequent, it is possible to reject or replace

the artifacts by different correcting and editing methods before performing HR variability analysis. However, if the R–R interval time series contains many or recurrent artifacts, it is recommended that one should eliminate those entire segments with artifact prior to HR variability analysis or even to reject the entire recording (Malik and Camm, 1995). Several investigators have emphasized the importance of pre-processing of R–R interval time series to improve the quality of various HR variability analysis (Cheung, 1981; Malik et al., 1989a,b; Berntson et al., 1990, 1997; Cripps et al., 1991; Sapoznikov et al., 1992; Laguna et al., 1996; Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996; Salo et al., 2001; Mateo and Laguna, 2003; Thuraisingham, 2006; Tarkiainen et al., 2007; Peltola et al., 2008, 2011; Sassi and Mainardi, 2008; Colak, 2009; Kumaravel and Santhi, 2010). These studies conﬁrm the view that the editing of R–R interval time series is an important aspect of HR variability measurement process.
Many methods and algorithms for editing or correcting the dubious R–R intervals have been developed and evaluated. Some of the common artifact correction and editing techniques involve deletion, interpolation of degree zero, interpolation of degree one (linear interpolation), and cubic spline interpolation. In addition, several other methods have been proposed for artifact correction such as comparing and merging method (Cheung, 1981), the predictive autocorrelation method (Albrecht and Cohen, 1988), non-linear predictive interpolation (Lippman et al., 1993), exclusion of R–R interval segments with divergent duration (Rottman et al., 1990; Lombardi et al., 1996a), impulse rejection (McNames et al., 2004), the integral pulse frequency model (IPFM; Mateo and Laguna, 2003; Solem et al., 2006), the sliding window average ﬁlter (Mietus, 2006), non-linear ﬁltering combined with wavelet based

Editing of R–R intervals

trend removal (Thuraisingham, 2006), and threshold ﬁltering also with wavelet based trend removal (Lee and Yu, 2010).
Probably the simplest way of editing is to delete the false R– R intervals. In the deletion process, the abnormal R–R intervals are removed and the preceding normal R–R intervals are then shifted to replace the deleted ones. Deletion editing decreases the length of the HR variability signal, i.e., due to the loss of deleted R–R intervals. This may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on HR variability, especially when assessing the power spectrum or analyzing R–R interval segments of short duration. However, if all the segments containing ectopic beats or other artifacts are deleted in an attempt to eliminate out any possible interference in HR variability analysis, this can lead to an unacceptable and systematic loss of information (Salo et al., 2001).
Interpolation methods replace the non-normal R–R intervals with new interpolated R–R intervals. Unlike the deletion method, interpolation methods preserve the initial number of samples. There are various interpolation algorithms such as interpolation of degree zero, linear, spline, and non-linear predictive interpolation. Most interpolation methods can be considered as serving as low-pass ﬁlters with different ﬁltering capacities. Interpolation of degree zero substitutes the abnormal R–R intervals with an average value that is computed from the neighboring normal R–R intervals. In interpolation of degree one, called the linear interpolation, a straight line is ﬁtted over the abnormal R–R intervals to obtain new values. One popular spline interpolation method is a cubic spline interpolation, where smooth curves are estimated through a number of data points by ﬁtting a third degree polynomial. It has been recommended to use interpolation methods when R–R interval time series contains occasional ectopic beats and artifacts. This concerns especially the power spectrum HR variability analysis (Kamath and Fallen, 1995).
Non-linear predictive interpolation for R–R interval artifact correction was introduced by Lippman et al. (1993). This algorithm is based on the fact that beat-to-beat variations in HR appear in a deterministic way. This algorithm utilizes methods of originating from chaos theory for locating ectopy-free portions of the R–R interval sequence. The purpose of the ectopy-free R–R interval sequence is to describe trajectories in the phase space that are locally similar to those of the segments containing ectopic beats. A trajectory is chosen such that it approximates most accurately to the particular segment with ectopic beats and this is then used to determine the replacement R–R intervals for the ectopic beats (Lippman et al., 1993).
R–R interval time series of longer duration can also contain slow linear trends and non-stationarities. Trend removal is a common way to preprocess R–R interval time series and diminish the effects of non-stationarities on HR variability analysis. Trend removal is usually performed with detrending methods that can be based on the ﬁrst or higher order polynomial models (Litvack et al., 1995; Mitov, 1998). The so called smoothness priors approach (Tarvainen et al., 2002) is another ﬁltering method to detrend signal. Non-stationarities have effects especially on the computation of FFT power spectrum. One additional method to avoid the effects of artifacts is to compute FFT spectrum estimates in ﬁnite length windows, which contains data of 2 or 5 min (Stein et al., 1995; Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996). Next,

the window is moved along the signal producing consecutive estimates of the spectrum. Most studies reject segments that contain less than 80% of normal-to-normal beats. The aim of this method is to obtain correct data for FFT power spectrum analysis of 24-h ECG recording. This method is suitable for estimating the power of higher frequencies, HF and LF components. The power of lower frequency bands, VLF and ULF, cannot be reliably estimated using 5-min measure, because it does not contain ﬂuctuations with longer cycle lengths (Kleiger et al., 2005).
EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT EDITING METHODS ON HR VARIABILITY ANALYSES There are studies which have compared how the different editing methods impact on the results of HR variability analyses (Albrecht and Cohen, 1988; Birkett et al., 1991; Lippman et al., 1994; Salo et al., 2001; Peltola et al., 2004; Tarkiainen et al., 2007; Sassi and Mainardi, 2008). However, these studies can produce different results depending on the study setting. Despite the differences in the results, the message is the same, editing methods do have effects on HR variability analysis. Differences between results can be attributable to the type of study populations used, the length of R–R interval time series, editing methods, the type of HR variability analyses and the amount of edited samples, etc.
Spectrum analyses are sensitive to the signal length and any loss of samples and discontinuity of signal can affect the results. It has been recommended that one should avoid the deletion method in artifact correction and to use some other replacement methods in HR variability spectrum analyses (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996; Salo et al., 2001; Mateo and Laguna, 2003). Deletion of R–R intervals may introduce step-like shapes into R–R interval time series, resulting in an increase in abrupt changes in the beat-tobeat variability and disruptions in the natural ﬂuctuation. Deletion shortens the waveform of R–R interval time series and produces false frequency components in the HF and also in the LF area, resulting in a broadening of the spectra in the HF and LF bands. For example, in the study of Salo et al. (2001) with AMI patients, the errors in the HF and LF components of the short-term R–R interval time series were over 5% when less than 5% of the R–R intervals were deletion edited. These effects on the waveform make the deletion method unsuitable also for the analyses of the VLF and ULF components (Salo et al., 2001). Furthermore, it has been reported to prefer interpolation methods to deletion method in the DFA analysis of short- (α1) and long-term (α2) fractal scaling exponents (Peltola et al., 2004; Tarkiainen et al., 2007; Sassi and Mainardi, 2008). Deletion editing may produce a false increase in the values of α1 in patients with acute myocardial infarction (Peltola et al., 2004) and in patients with coronary artery disease (Tarkiainen et al., 2007).
Although the deletion method may not be the most suitable method for editing, especially with respect to power spectrum HR variability analysis, it can be a feasible method of editing in the time domain for the analysis of SDNN and SDANN (Salo et al., 2001). However, in the same study of Salo et al. (2001), deletion editing was not recommended for the computation of pNN50 and RMSSD, again interpolation methods were considered superior. Nonetheless, deletion can be a suitable method for artifact removal in the case of the disturbances lasting for longer periods (Kamath

Editing of R–R intervals

and Fallen, 1995). These include artifacts such as frequent ectopic beats and AF, the duration of which can last from several minutes to several hours (AF).
Different interpolation methods, artifact and trend removal methods and spectrum estimation methods have been proposed to especially improve the quality of the power spectrum HR variability analysis (Albrecht and Cohen, 1988; Birkett et al., 1991; Lippman et al., 1994; Salo et al., 2001; Mateo and Laguna, 2003; McNames et al., 2004; Clifford and Tarassenko, 2005; Colak, 2009; Kumaravel and Santhi, 2010; Lee and Yu, 2010). However, the results of these studies are dependent on the methods being used and on the type and length of R–R interval data. For example, Albrecht and Cohen (1988) claimed that the linear interpolation produced a more accurate power spectrum compared to the predictive autocorrelation method.
Lippman et al. (1994) compared the removal of ectopic beats with linear, cubic, and non-linear predictive interpolation in HR variability analysis with short-term R–R interval time series. They reported the necessity for editing and concluded that the removal of ectopic beats and non-linear predictive interpolation lead to better performance compared to linear and cubic spline interpolation, which overestimated the LF power and underestimated the HF power.
Salo et al. (2001) compared the performance of deletion editing with the interpolation of degree zero and one in HR variability of frequency-domain parameters. They examined short- and longterm R–R interval data of healthy subjects and patients with AMI. They found that the interpolation of degree zero and one perform at least equally well and in some cases was superior compared to the deletion method. However, the interpolation of artifacts can change the power of the frequency components by introducing false shapes and trends into R–R interval time series. For example, interpolation of degree zero leads to ﬂat shapes in R– R interval time series since it uses the same average value over a whole segment of successive non-normal R–R intervals. Similarly, interpolation of degree one produces slope-like shapes, especially in R–R interval time series of high beat-to-beat variability. The longer the R–R interval segment is to edit the larger the ﬂat or slope-like shape is. This generation of false trends due to interpolation may explain why linear and cubic spline interpolation have been reported to increase the power of the LF and VLF components in HR variability spectrum (Birkett et al., 1991; Salo et al., 2001). In addition, large segments cannot reasonably be edited with the interpolation methods due to the increase in false trends.
Interpolation methods have been examined and tested also for DFA analysis. Peltola et al. (2004) evaluated several interpolation methods including interpolation of degree zero and one and cubic spline interpolation and considered them to be more suitable for the analysis of fractal scaling exponents α1 and α2 than the deletion method. They found that the performance of the different interpolation methods depended on the scaling exponent (α1 or α2) and on the data type (healthy vs. AMI patient). Peltola et al. stated that the interpolation of degree zero was the most suitable method for the analysis of α1. In their analysis of α2, Peltola et al. observed that the deletion method produced much larger errors than the interpolation method. This was conﬁrmed by Sassi and Mainardi (2008) who showed that the linear interpolation

(interpolation of degree one) and substitution with local mean (interpolation of degree zero) performed better and introduced smaller errors in the long-term DFA analysis than the deletion method. The effects between different editing methods may not be very signiﬁcant when the number of artifacts is small. Peltola et al. (2004) reported that the effects of editing in DFA analysis were minor, i.e., interpolation methods were as good as the deletion method when there was a small number of ectopic beats (<5%). This was conﬁrmed by Tarkiainen et al. (2007) who did not detect signiﬁcant differences between the performance of deletion and linear interpolation in the short-term DFA analysis and other non-linear HR dynamics when the number of ectopic beats was less than 10%.
Short-term HR variability analyses are more sensitive to artifacts and editing (Task Force of ESC and NASPE, 1996). The more R–R interval samples in the signal the better the capability of maintaining the original beat-to-beat variability despite the presence of edited R–R intervals. A 24-h R–R interval time series contains approximately 90000 R–R intervals. Correspondingly, a 5-min segment may contain about 300 R–R intervals. Even a small number of edited R–R intervals may impact on the results of HR variability analyses, especially with the short-term R–R interval data. Longterm time domain analysis including computation of SDNN and long-term spectrum analysis including ULF, VLF, and the slope of the lower frequencies (Bigger et al., 1996) mainly suffer from the deletion of the R–R intervals. For example, Salo et al. (2001) demonstrated that in long-term R–R interval time series (24 h) one could use the interpolation methods to edit up to 50% of all R–R intervals without causing any major changes in the results (error <5%). However, with short-term R–R interval time series, even a small number of edited intervals (<5%) can affect HR variability results not only with the spectrum analysis of HF and LF components but also with statistical time domain parameters such as pNN50 and RMSSD (Salo et al., 2001).
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Ideally, the most reliable HR variability analysis is performed with R–R interval data with pure sinus beats. Technical developments in the ECG and R–R interval recording devices and improvement in the technology and materials of the electrodes have reduced the number of technical artifact. In addition, the importance of high-quality R-peak detection systems has also been noted. If one is able to perform an accurate R-peak detection, then it may be possible to decrease the number of artifact in the R–R interval time series. However, all the false R–R intervals, especially those of physiological origin, can never be eliminated. Since it is practically impossible to achieve data of 24-h free of artifact in ambulatory ECG recordings the focus must be directed to pre-processing and editing methods for the R–R intervals.
Accurate R–R interval artifact correction and editing methods are needed. It is possible to improve the quality of results of HR variability analyses with careful editing and by choosing appropriate editing methods. Various authors have proposed different approaches for handling ectopic beats and other artifacts. Nonetheless, currently there is no consensus about how to best edit artifact. The literature does not have any standard and detailed recommendations about suitable editing methods for different

Editing of R–R intervals

HR variability analyses. Only one agreement exists concerning the power spectrum analysis of HR variability: in most studies artifact and ectopic beats should be interpolated instead of deleted. In addition, the maximum number for edited R–R intervals for HR variability analyses has not been standardized. Most investigators edit or reject the artifact and require at least 80% normal R–R intervals, especially in frequency-domain HR variability analysis. However, in different studies the amount of editing has ranged from 1 to 30% of the R–R intervals.
Various HR variability studies may use different R–R interval pre-processing and editing methods. This can lead to problems in any comparison of results obtained with HR variability analyses. This can be due to the different numbers of edited R–R intervals, analyzed HR variability parameter, type of the study population (high or low HR variability), length of the R–R interval time series or due to editing method selected. In the future, it is recommended that HR variability papers should contain an accurate description of the methods selected for pre-processing and editing.
The selection of editing methods or the absence of manual editing can be a problem also in current HR variability software. There can be a lack of information about how to deal with ectopic beats and other artifacts. Some HR variability software may include automatic systems for artifact correction. These can be based on some type of prematurity threshold extracting those R–R intervals that exceed the threshold value. Others may handle

artifact by applying some trend removal processes. These kinds of automatic R–R interval editing are convenient to use and may perform adequately, especially in the cases of R–R intervals time series with low beat-to-beat variability and distinct ectopic beats or normal healthy adult with any or only small number of false beats. Nonetheless, many experts believe that manual editing with visual veriﬁcation of the R–R intervals and a careful choice of the appropriate editing method is a more reliable method and can never be fully replaced by the current automatic correction systems. High-quality R-peak detection system together with accurate artifact editing are crucial for reliable HR variability analyses. Trustworthy R–R interval pre-processing software should contain (1) a possibility to view the ECG signal and the results of the Rpeak detection process and a possibility to correct the false points and (2) manual or automatic editing of artifacts with different editing methods and a visual view of the edited R–R interval time series.
Despite the differences in HR variability study settings, many studies emphasize the importance of the artifact correction and appropriate editing if one wishes to conduct reliable HR variability analyses. In the future, more comparative studies will be needed to deﬁne standard recommendations for the suitable pre-processing and editing methods of R–R interval time series and the maximum number of edited R–R intervals which can be present in any shortand long-term HR variability analyses.

Frequency analysis of the electrocardiographic RR interval is a common method of quantifying autonomic outﬂow by measuring the beat-to-beat modulation of the heart (heart rate variability; HRV). This review identiﬁes a series of problems with the methods of doing so—the interpretation of low-frequency spectral power, the multiple use of equivalent normalized low frequency (LFnu), high frequency (HFnu) and ratio (LF/HF) terms, and the lack of control over extraneous variables, and reviews research in the calendar year 2012 to determine their prevalence and severity. Results support the mathematical equivalency of ratio units across studies, a reliance on those variables to explain autonomic outﬂow, and insufﬁcient control of critical experimental variables. Research measurement of HRV has a substantial need for general methodological improvement.

INTRODUCTION Heart rate variability (HRV), the ﬂuctuation of instantaneous heart period over time, is a correlate of cardiac autonomic regulation. HRV techniques have been applied in a broad range of contexts—they have been used to predict mortality after myocardial infarction (Buccelletti et al., 2009), as a correlate of stress (Berntson and Cacioppo, 2007) and psychopathology, to stratify attention (Mulder and Mulder, 1981), and have been incorporated into biobehavioral models of self-regulation (Porges, 1995; Thayer and Lane, 2000). The idea that reliable measurement of autonomic state may be obtained cheaply and non-invasively is obviously appealing. Figure 1 illustrates a growing interest in HRV methods over time, a trend which seem likely to continue given the increasing access to heart rate data through recent technological advances—heart rate has recently been accurately calculated via smartphone (Heathers, 2013), microwave (Suzuki et al., 2008) and induction-powered indwelling device (Riistama et al., 2007).
Short recordings of HRV (i.e., less than 1 h) typically show two primary patterns of oscillation which are separated into frequency bands from ≈7 to 25 s (0.04–0.15 Hz; low frequency, or LF) and 2.5 to ≈7 s (0.15–0.4 Hz; high frequency, or HF)—lower frequencies than LF are generally not meaningful over the short term. LF and HF frequency bands are widely used to quantify parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation (Akselrod et al., 1981) and their interaction (Malliani et al., 1991).
As ease of access to HRV increases, establishing and maintaining correct methodology is important—redundant methodology may delay treatment, obscure valuable underlying effects, provoke Type I or II errors, and most importantly, potentially delegitimize both alternative useful results and the utility of HRV in general.

However, the internal and external consistency of the methods used have received comparatively less research interest than the understanding of the autonomic, cardiac and circulatory which creates those methods (Billman, 2011).
Thus, this paper presents a focused review of HRV methodology in the frequency domain which serves two purposes. Firstly, to raise several inter-connected points concerning the collection, interpretation and interrelationship of frequency-domain HRV variables, and external factors which may inﬂuence their recording. While there are many unsettled questions concerning meaning and calculation frequency domain HRV, the points raised here are generally not in dispute—they are either derived from a strong base of evidence, or are deﬁned mathematically.
Secondly, to formally outline the awareness of these methodological points with reference to a large convenience sample of work using HRV methods. This sample is drawn from the most recent complete calendar year (2012) at the time of writing.
THE INTERPRETATION OF LF POWER All measures of HRV are necessarily complex as heart period over time is variously affected by multiple autonomic outﬂows, the modulation of those outﬂows at the sinoatrial node, their pacemaker response and competition, and the dynamic regulation of the vasculature, as well as endocrine, endothelial and mechanical factors. These interactions are further complicated by the realization that the individual mechanisms which may inﬂuence heart period are themselves incompletely understood. Examples include the source of cardiorespiratory coupling via either a central oscillator or the baroreﬂex (Eckberg, 2009; Karemaker, 2009), the mechanism behind periodic changes in blood pressure (Julien, 2006), the intrinsic meaning or function of respiratory

total beta-adrenergic blockade with propanolol (a non-selective β-blocker). A modest increase in LF power (Chiladakis et al., 2004) or no difference to baseline (Taylor et al., 1998) have been reported subsequent to treatment with atenolol (a β1-antagonist).
Likewise, cardiac 6-[18F] ﬂuorodopamine imaging in humans (Goldstein et al., 1990, 1993), which radiolabels catecholamine storage vesicles, has repeatedly shown no relationship between radioactivity subsequent to cardiac sympathetic activity and LF-HRV power (Alvarenga et al., 2006; Moak et al., 2007; Rahman et al., 2011). Likewise, there are dissociations between other measurements of SNS via impedance cardiograph (Goedhart et al., 2008), salivary alpha-amylase (Nater et al., 2007; Kobayashi et al., 2012), circulating epinephrine/norepinephrine (Sloan et al., 1996), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (Grassi and Esler, 1999). This evidence has been recently covered at length (Goldstein et al., 2011; Reyes del Paso et al., 2013).
The connection between LF power and sympathetic activity, while frequently cited as representative of (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986), is a misrepresentation of the initial claim that normalized LF power is representative of relative sympathetic power as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This, and related theory, is dealt with below.

sinus arrhythmia (Hayano et al., 1996; Tzeng et al., 2009; Ben-Tal et al., 2012; Elstad, 2012).
Irrespective of this, the power spectral density of high frequency HRV is strongly associated with cardiovagal activity (Akselrod et al., 1981; Kamath and Fallen, 1993; Malik, 1996). Respiratory variation observed in heart period is linearly related to parasympathetic control of heart rate (Katona and Jih, 1975), and its modulation forms the theoretical center of most HRV analysis. However, it should be noted that HF HRV is not abolished by vagotomy (Tzeng et al., 2005, 2007), and shows a complex and only somewhat dose-dependent relationship with muscarinic blockade (Picard et al., 2009).
Alternatively, the debate over the characterization, meaning and utility of LF HRV is ongoing issue (Akselrod et al., 1981; Porges and Byrne, 1992; Hopf et al., 1995; Introna et al., 1995; Sleight et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Grasso et al., 1997; Malliani et al., 1998; Sleight and Bernardi, 1998; Houle and Billman, 1999; Notarius et al., 1999; Notarius and Floras, 2001; Elghozi and Julien, 2007; Billman, 2011, 2013; Goldstein et al., 2011; Pagani et al., 2012; Reyes del Paso et al., 2013).
To fully describe the physiology involved above is beyond the scope of this review. Within the present context, we may conﬁne ourselves to addressing one common claim about frequency analysis—the involvement of the SNS in vasomotor control (Julien, 2006), and the strong relationship between the baroreﬂex and LF power (Goldstein et al., 2011) has occasionally been extrapolated to the position that LF power is proportional to cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. The direct evidence against this claim is strong even if conﬁned to just non-invasive or minimally invasive studies in humans.
For instance, beta-adrenergic antagonists have shown divergent effects on LF power. Jokkel et al. (1995), for instance, report an approximate doubling of LF power in response to

THE LF/HF RATIO
The ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power (LF/HF ratio), as popularized by (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986), is commonly used as a measure of sympathovagal balance—the putative balance between the mutually opposing branches of the autonomic nervous system. While widely used, this approach has been criticized on a number of grounds. The disconnection between this understanding of short-term spectral power within the heart series and the known physiology related to that power (Eckberg, 1997; Goldstein et al., 2011; Billman, 2013), and the response to those criticisms (Malliani et al., 1998; Pagani et al., 2012), have been covered in detail. As above, much of this is a natural extension of the argument that the numerator (i.e., LF power) reﬂects sympathetic outﬂow poorly, if at all.
From a methodological perspective, however, it is most concerning that there may be no mathematical basis on which to compare LF and HF power. Values of HRV are typically internally consistent, in that changes within a frequency band on individual sequential measurements may be directional or proportional. That is to say, it is meaningful that an individual under acute stress experiences a reduction in HF power from baseline, and that additive stress provokes additive change. However, those changes have less bearing on other measured quantities (i.e., a loss of HF power is compared to a loss of LF power; a loss of HF power between individuals, etc.). This is subsequent to considerations such that (a) ﬂuctuations in HRV should more correctly be considered ﬂuctuations in the modulation of autonomic tone, not a change in autonomic outﬂow (e.g., Katona et al., 1977), (b) the properties of interaction and competition between muscarinic and adrenergic outﬂow at the sinoatrial node are both non-linear (e.g., Levy, 1984) and mediated by neuropeptide co-transmitters (e.g., Revington and McCloskey, 1990), and c) changes in both low- and high- frequency power are mediated by both SNS and PNS (e.g., Taylor et al., 2001). This is often expressed simply

Methodology in HRV

by characterizing HRV as a qualitative, not quantitative, variable (Notarius and Floras, 2001; Billman, 2011).
However, the possibility of measuring sympathovagal balance in the manner above has been repeatedly classed as heuristic (Malliani et al., 1998; Sleight and Bernardi, 1998; Malliani, 2005). This position has a great deal of merit, as it is inevitable that complex or poorly understood phenomena will be demonstrably related to other dependent or independent variables in advance of our ability to explain why this is so. In other words, a metric may be useful well before it appears meaningful. One argument related to the above is the clear interrelationship during graded orthostatic tilt between (1) tilt angle, (2) sympathetic outﬂow, and (3) LF/HF ratio, the conclusion being that as all of these positively covary, then LF/HF ratio well describes, and is capable of predicting tilt angle (Montano et al., 1994). This may be the case, but only indicates an association between these factors, rather than a reason for their association.
Orthostasis provides an interesting comparative example. Figure 2 graphs mean pre-ejection period (PEP) against the angle of graded tilt with an overlaid quadratic regression (assuming that the relationship between cardiovascular response to tilt vs. angle is curvilinear). In this situation, the heuristic value of adjusted or unadjusted PEP is substantial, perhaps equivalent of some reports of spectral power (Bahjaoui-Bouhaddi et al., 2000), even without considering the individual regressions.
It seems very likely that predictions made in the manner of Malliani et al. (1997), where normalized units were successfully employed in a model to delineate posture, would be successful with PEP. Thus, as the following are clearly demonstrated:
(1) there is a predictable, positive relationship between PEP and positive tilt
(2) this relationship parallels an established positive relationship between SNS outﬂow and positive tilt (e.g., Chosy and Graham, 1965; Iwase et al., 1987)
FIGURE 2 | The curvilinear relationship between pre-ejection period (PEP) and tilt angle during orthstatic stress. Data from Chan et al. (2007) (1) and Stafford et al. (1970) (2).

. . . we may draw a heuristic conclusion: (3) PEP is positively related to sympathetic outﬂow.
However, the normal relationship between PEP and SNS outﬂow is precisely the opposite. Sympathetic activity, as measured by circulating catecholamines (Chosy and Graham, 1965) or by MSNA (Iwase et al., 1987), increases reliably during orthostatic tilt. In other contexts, this might well accompany a decrease in PEP (Newlin and Levenson, 1979). However, our model here fails to account for the effects of preload—the initial stretching of the myocardium due to passive factors prior to the cardiac cycle— which increases proportionally with tilt angle independently of sympathetic drive (Stafford et al., 1970). Thus, a heuristic variable formed between two robust associations may be precisely predictive but ultimately misleading. This is precisely the criticism leveled by Grassi and Esler (1999); that LF/HF ratio fails to describe SNS outﬂow outside of the demonstration provided by changes in orthostasis.
Finally, the source of LF power is well characterized—LF power generally reﬂects the activity of the baroreﬂex in response to vasomotor tone. This is broadly accepted consequential to the classical demonstrations of the close correspondence between blood pressure waves and sympathetic modulation (Guyton and Harris, 1951), which are reﬂected in the heart period by the compensation of the baroreﬂex. This interpretation is not in dispute; a comprehensive summary is given in Berntson et al. (1997).
THE REDUNDANCY OF NORMALIZED UNITS AND LF/HF RATIO Normalized HRV values (LFnu, HFnu) are calculated from the raw values of either short-term frequency band (LF or HF) divided by the total spectral power (typically LF + HF), with the value of this typically expressed as a percentage or decimal. These variables have a long history (e.g., Lombardi et al., 1987) in quantifying HRV, and have been used to quantify proportional sympathetic and parasympathetic activity respectively (e.g., Pagani et al., 1986). They are of particular interest in reviewing the available literature as they provide a degree of interpretability between studies, as proportional change between deﬁned frequency bands can be seen as roughly equivalent regardless of the spectral method used. Unlike raw power, this allows direct comparison between frequency and autoregressive methods for calculating spectral power, between spectral power expressed as ms2 or bpm2, and between different algorithms for calculation, windowing methods, time periods, etc. These differences often result in baseline spectral values which are multiple orders of magnitude apart between studies (Sandercock, 2007).
However, the typical use of normalized units presents a series of signiﬁcant redundancies. Firstly, LFnu and HFnu are trivially equivalent, as LFnu = 1-HFnu. This implies that calculations cannot be duplicated, as LFnu calculations are perfectly linearly related (i.e., computationally identical) to HFnu (Chemla et al., 2005). Reporting both values provides no additional information over reporting one, and change in one is identical to change in the other. In this manner, it is necessarily incorrect to refer to HFnu and LFnu as separate concepts. Instead, this model must describe a single autonomic continuum along which individual points represent the admixture of low and high frequency power.

Furthermore, reporting calculations where only one normalized value is signiﬁcant should be considered inconsistent.
There are exceptions to the above. Firstly, when normalized values are calculated from an expanded power spectrum; occasionally, Very Low Frequency (VLF; 0.003–0.04 Hz) may be included in the denominator of normalized units (i.e., LFnu = LF/VLF + LF + HF), likewise power about the HF cutoff (i.e., >0.4 Hz), or the total power of the observed spectrum (TP; 0–0.5 Hz) may be used as the denominator (i.e., LFnu = LF/TP; this is sometimes called LF%). However, in short recordings, the inclusion of these longer timescales is a signiﬁcant problem as the contribution from very low frequencies is undersampled in the manner described below, and the Nyquist criterion prevents any meaningful contribution at frequencies higher than HF.
Secondly, when the autoregressive method is used to quantify spectral bands, often, the individual components identiﬁed for LF and HF bands sum to less than the measure of “total power”—the additive model minus the component at VLF. In this case, LFnu + HFnu will be less than 1, but most likely very close to it. As far as I am aware, there is no evidence to indicate that this establishes LFnu and HFnu as separate theoretical entities rather than measurement error. If the autoregressive model is a poor ﬁt for the available data, then LFnu + HFnu may be signiﬁcantly less than 1.
In addition, it is trivial to transform the LF/HF ratio as directly proportional to a normalized value of either spectral band (Burr, 2007):

Graphically, the function above is shown in Figure 3A—it is monotonically increasing at all positive non-zero values, nonlinear, and well approximated by logarithmic regression over a typically observed range (r2 > 0.99). As the distribution of the LF/HF ratio is often positively skewed, it is frequently logtransformed to meet criteria of normality (e.g., Kobayashi et al., 2012). In this case, the non-linear relationship becomes signiﬁcantly attenuated and very closely approximates linearity (Figure 3B)—thus a linear regression has an identical coefﬁcient, constant term and r2-value.
In this manner, any given value of LFnu or HFnu has a directly equivalent LF/HF value. It should be emphasized that this is not a conceptual similarity but an equivalence at the level of deﬁnition—for example, an LF/HF ratio of 0.6 is precisely equivalent to LFnu = 37.5% or HFnu = 62.5%. Consequently, individual normalized values contain no more information than individual LF/HF ratio values, and on this basis it is unclear how “sympathetic balance” (LFnu) is mathematically different to “parasympathetic modulation” (HFnu) or how either is conceptually different to “sympathovagal balance” (LF/HF).
Similarly, due to the non-normal distribution of typical data, HRV variables are occasionally presented as median and interquartile range. As rank order is preserved in a monotonic increasing relationship, medians and inter-quartile values should remain direct transformations of each other, and statistical calculations on rank order should be identical between normalized and ratio values; a full description of this and other redundancies can be seen in Burr (2007).
However, due to the moderate non-linearity, mean (LF/HF) is not identical to mean (LFnu). This relationship is explored in

Figure 4, where LFnu and LF/HF values from realistic artiﬁcial samples reveal a convergence toward the central value of LFnu with larger sample size, and a consistent predictive value between means. Thus, it is likely that statistical comparisons under standard parametric assumptions for LF nu and LF/HF would be similar without being identical.

INTERPRETING NORMALIZED UNITS IN THE ABSENCE OF RAW POWER
Normalized units, which report frequency power proportional to the total observed power, possess an additional problem—that several different patterns of change in individual spectral bands may result in identical changes in proportion. This is illustrated in Figure 5, where a hypothetical participant with a baseline LFnu = 0.33 increases to LFnu = 0.5 after experimental intervention. This change in normalized units therefore represents not one possible change, but a continuum of possible changes which variously encompass (1) an increase, decrease or no change in (2) either total power, raw LF or raw HF power. Any point on the line of identity described in Figure 5 fulﬁlls the criteria of LFnu = 0.5, but the individual points represent entirely different outcomes (Billman, 2013).
In other words, the reporting of HRV solely as a proportion directly obscures the underlying interpretation. It is precisely this form of interpretability which the seminal Task Force paper (Malik, 1996) sought to preserve within normalized values by recommending that research should always report both normalized and raw values for clarity.
This is not merely a hypothetical scenario, and one of our recent papers illustrates this clearly (Krygier et al., 2013). In this study, comparisons of HRV metrics are drawn from a sample of meditators at rest and during Vipassana meditation, and both before and after an intense intervention—around 100 h of intensive training over 10 days. While the overall interaction was not signiﬁcant, an intriguing and signiﬁcant increase in HFnu was observed, as reported in previous research on similar forms of meditation (e.g., Sarang and Telles, 2006; Wu and Lo, 2008; An et al., 2010). A naïve characterization might be that a beneﬁcial change representing an “increase in vagal tone” or a “favourable autonomic balance” was introduced by meditative

Points are means derived from approximately typical pseudorandom (Mersenne Twister) normally distributed values of LF ms2 (mean = 600, SD = 200) and HF ms2 (mean = 800, SD = 200). The values are distributed near the point of mean equivalence, LFnu = 0.429. r2-values range from 0.833 to 0.902.

FIGURE 5 | The outcome of a hypothetical experiential effect—a participant with LFnu = 0.33 (LF ms2 = 500, HF ms2 = 1000) increases to LFnu = 0.5, which is deﬁned by any point on the line of identity (i.e., LF ms2 = HF ms2). The arrows and operations on the line designate where values may be smaller, equal to, or greater for the corresponding spectral
regions (LF, low frequency; HF, high frequency; and TP, total power).

training, but follow-up analyses revealed that normalized change was speciﬁcally mediated by (a) a profound increase in HRV at breathing frequency during meditation in untrained participants, and (b) a profound decrease in HRV at Mayer wave frequency during meditation when trained (Figure 6).
These changes precisely mirror the subjective reports of how meditative practice proceeds. Naïve practitioners of Vipassana, instructed to observe the breathing cycle rather than alter it, invariably “over-breathe,” which typically corresponds to an increased tidal volume and reduced respiratory rate. Within the lower portion of the HF spectra, this increases observed HF power (Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993). However, this problem is mastered within a few days as participants practice the ability to passively observe normal respiratory cycles.
The above is a single unreplicated ﬁnding, and due to the nature of the task, breathing could not be consciously controlled (a potential confound, as breath has its own relationship to attention; see Vlemincx et al., 2012). Thus, while the above explanation is speculative, two points remain regardless: (1) the reference to individual frequency bands has greater explanatory power than the original naïve interpretation, especially considering changes in respiratory parameters, mood, attention, etc. are reliably predicted by spectral power in individual frequencies, and (2) the changes described within individual frequency bands may be entirely inconsistent with, and obscured by, the reporting of lone normalized HRV values.
TIME RESOLUTION OF LF POWER While an RR series does not consist entirely of cyclical processes (Peng et al., 1995), frequency analysis approximates the action of autonomic outﬂow to the heart by quantifying cyclical information present. In doing so, the number of times a cyclical frequency can be observed during an electrocardiographic recording varies

linearly with the length of the recording, and inversely with the period of the frequency.
Consequently, HF HRV may be successfully recorded over periods of time as short as 60 s (Malik, 1996) as this gives adequate resolution to cycles within the heart period driven by respiratory sinus arrhythmia, typically around 0.25 Hz at rest. LF HRV requires a longer period in order for the spectral information to be reliably present. In short recordings, these frequencies may be insufﬁciently sampled—a signal at 0.04 Hz (i.e., with a period of 25 s) is observed 2.4 times per minute.
A heuristic rule which has been occasionally stated requires the sampling period to contain 10 complete cycles of the lowest observed frequency in order for the underlying information to be successfully approximated (Malik, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997) but there appears to be no analytical exposition of this. This has loosely translated into an accepted standard of a 5 min recording to measure short-term HRV, as a 5 min recording by this deﬁnition can resolve frequencies down to 0.033 Hz. Consequently, power from the LF spectrum down to 0.04 Hz is necessarily included in both normalized and LF/HF ratio calculations of HRV. Thus, both measurements should be taken over a minimum of 5 min.
EXTRANEOUS VARIABLES TO RECORDING BASELINE HEART PERIOD Studies which measure variables that may be broadly affected by incidental day-to-day factors are usually carefully controlled. In human populations, research is often conducted speciﬁc to age group, experimental environment, time of day, medication status, environmental stimulants (i.e., caffeine or other methylxanthines), and so on. In longer studies or those requiring strenuous activity, standardized food and drink is provided. Studies in HRV are especially subject to these concerns—due to the autonomic innervation of the viscera, there are several instances where

artifacts to short-term HRV measurement at rest may reliably arise from demographic variables, and the normal activities of daily living. Of course, controlling daily activity is not possible or even desirable in some patient groups, especially if long term monitoring is required (i.e., if measured over 24 h) but in laboratory or naturalistic experiments, it is ideal to observe potential changes in autonomic activity with as few confounding variables present as possible.
These variables are occasionally recognized; most research, for instance, is aware that HRV declines with age (O’Brien et al., 1986), is broadly affected by cardiovascular, vasoactive and psychotropic medication (e.g., beta-blockers; Sandrone et al., 1994), and is affected by both circadian rhythm (e.g., Massin et al., 2000) and wakefulness (Walker et al., 2009). Less frequently recognized is the ﬁnding that the autonomic innervation of the viscera means the consequences of feeding (i.e., the acute consumption of food and water, gastric distension and bladder ﬁlling) directly affect HRV.
Of these, the most attention has been paid to water consumption (May and Jordan, 2011) subsequent to the ﬁnding that patients with severe hypotension due to autonomic failure derived a signiﬁcant reduction in symptoms from drinking water, and this subjective improvement was observed parallel to substantial increases in blood pressure (Jordan et al., 2000). A similar effect can be observed when the baroreﬂex loop is opened in sinoaortically denervated mice (McHugh et al., 2010).
In normal participants, the same presumed pressor effect takes place, and can be observed in muscle sympathetic outﬂow (Scott et al., 2001), but changes in blood pressure are immediately buffered by the efferent vagal baroreﬂex, and the immediate consequence is a moderate to large compensatory increase in heart period and HF-HRV. Healthy participants approximately double baseline HF-HRV, while the effects on HR are signiﬁcant within 10 min after ingestion, peak at around 15–20 min and return to baseline by 45 min (Routledge et al., 2002). Recent work (Mendonca et al., 2013) has suggested that these effects only become negligent at VO2 maximum.
Eating and subsequent digestion have autonomic consequences which appear to be mediated both by gastric distention
(Rossi et al., 1998) and by exposure to food-related stimuli (Nederkoorn et al., 2000). Mechanical and electrical stimuli to the stomach are both powerful hypotensive stimuli (Pozo et al., 1985), and this effect is abolished by vagotomy (Liu et al., 2004). In addition, the digestive process provokes vagal withdrawal as measured by HRV for at least 60 min after a meal (Lu et al., 1999), and increases sympathetic outﬂow to the skeletal muscles but not the heart (Fagius and Berne, 1994; Cox et al., 1995). Due to the relationship between the thermic effect of food and sympathetic outﬂow, this response is heavily affected by macronutrient composition (Welle et al., 1981; Schwartz et al., 1985).
Finally, bladder distension has been observed to provoke a robust series of pressor-mediated responses in humans (Fagius and Karhuvaara, 1989), where bladder distention predicts an increase in muscle sympathetic nerve outﬂow and blood pressure. Ben-Dror et al. (2012) subsequently delineated a linear rise in lnLF power with acute bladder ﬁlling in healthy controls drinking water. While this may have been confounded with

the osmopressor effect (as above), a similar effect was observed using ﬁlling cystometry (i.e., causing bladder distension without drinking; Mehnert et al., 2009).
REVIEW PARAMETERS In order to conﬁrm both the nature and the extent of the problems outlined above, a substantial body of work is drawn from the recent HRV literature (i.e., from 2012). This allows the possibility of (a) sufﬁciently characterizing HRV research as it is presently performed with reference to the methodological issues raised, (b) conﬁrming the presence and relevance of the mathematical relationships deﬁned above, and (c) observing the extent of experimental controls currently employed.
METHODS A non-systematic review was conducted: Google Scholar and PubMed databases were searched using the terms “heart rate variability” or “HRV” through either the title or abstract, with a date restriction of 01/01/12 through 31/12/12. Full text articles were obtained.
REVIEW PROCESS Non-English language journals, 24 h studies (title/abstract: “Holter,” “24 hr”), animal (title/abstract: “mouse,” “rat,” “dog,” etc.), developmental (title/abstract: “neonatal,” “infant,” “child,” etc.), geriatric (title/abstract: “elderly,” “geriatric,” etc.), and conference abstract, qualitative or discussion papers (title/abstract: “editorial,” “conference,” “review,” etc.) were excluded, as were papers which were formally published in 2011 or 2013 (n = 293). The remaining papers (n = 573) were superﬁcially reviewed to set initial criteria for inclusion.
SELECTION CRITERIA Age Pre-natal, infant, child and youth (mean age <18 years) samples, and elderly/geriatric samples (mean age > 65) were excluded.
Time period Consistent recording for more than 1 h was not considered short-term and excluded. 24 h or Holter monitor studies were included only if a short-term period was additionally analyzed and reported to the daily record.
Descriptive work Reviews, meta-analyses, position papers or commentaries, correspondence, etc. were excluded if descriptive of HRV phenomena instead of primary research, and included if they reported data from novel primary research.
Breathing Paced breathing at speeds above 0.15 Hz was included. Breathing protocols slower than 0.15 Hz likely to affect the fundamental distribution of spectral power were excluded.
Healthy baseline condition If plural baseline conditions were included within-subjects over one or multiple sessions, the ﬁrst criteria reported—either by time, or if unclear, by listed order—was considered the baseline.

Methodology in HRV

If plural conditions were averaged to make a global value, this was considered equal to the total recorded time. If a baseline included plural subsequent measurement periods, i.e., two recordings of 3 min separated by task, then the ﬁrst was used. Subsequent periods (i.e., “ﬁrst 5 mins, second 5 mins”) were recorded as a single value if given otherwise the ﬁrst period was used. Studies combining the averages of multiple time periods (i.e., the average of spectral values from two 3 min periods) were not recorded. Baselines immediately before surgery requiring general anesthesia were not considered resting, due to anticipatory anxiety. Multiple healthy groups from the same study were included if (a) listed separately at all points, and (b) were taken from baselines administered before random assignment into groups, or after assignment in benign circumstances. If sub-clinical groups from healthy populations were deﬁned (i.e., “high normal” anxiety vs. “low normal” anxiety) then the low pathology group was used. Unless speciﬁcally stated as standing or supine, it was assumed that participants or patients were seated.
RECORDED INFORMATION LF power The genesis of LF power provided was classiﬁed as being either (a) sympathetically mediated, (b) resulting from “both parasympathetic and sympathetic modulation,” (c) representing the gain of the baroreﬂex, or (d) other (parasympathetically mediated/not stated). Studies speciﬁcally measuring the LF response to graded tilt or postural change were taken as implying a relationship between LF and baroreﬂex outﬂow, as this is an orthostatic manipulation. If the basis of LF was derived from a reference without an explicit statement of what LF power was to represent, the interpretation within the reference was used according to the above criteria.
CONTROL OF EXTRANEOUS VARIABLES Circadian Circadian factors were considered controlled if both between and within subject comparisons were identical within a 24hr period, and conﬁned to an hour or a time window of up to 4 h (i.e., “9 am to 1 pm” or “beginning in the early morning”).
Illness/Medication Work addressing serious, debilitating, psychiatric or other chronic illness, or any illness whose primary etiology was cardiovascular or circulatory, was included only if a control group was available, as baseline HRV level or collection/analysis technique may be affected. Non-life threatening illness treatable with standard pharmacotherapy (such as asthma) or post-treatment groups which did not require major pharmacotherapy or surgery (e.g., recovered phobics) were included. The exclusion or statistical control of any medication apart from the contraceptive pill or unscheduled analgesics (e.g., Paracetamol, Ibuprofen) was considered controlled.
Food/Water Meals were regarded as controlled either if participants were recorded during a fasted state, or if a standard meal was provided or prescribed for study inclusion, likewise water. A fasted

state was assumed for participants measured at baseline before tilt-table testing. Water provided ad libitum was not considered controlled.
Bladder Bladder emptying was only recorded if it was explicitly stated, as no pre-surgical population was included.
Content With the exclusion criteria as above, the review proceeded pseudo-randomly (i.e., sequentially in alphabetical order by the surname of the ﬁrst author) until 100 samples were recorded.
ANALYSIS Comparisons between values were modeled respectively as the regressions HFnu = a/(b + c.(LF/HF)), LFnu = a/(b + c.(HF/LF)); all used the least-squares method and assumed initial conditions of any nominal constant = 1. The relationship between LFnu and HFnu was modeled by linear regression.
Relative standard errors (RSE; the standard error of the mean divided by the mean) were taken as measures of adjusted reliability for individual studies, and calculated from LF/HF ratios which were given in milliseconds squared, LFnu and HFnu values.
All calculations were performed in GraphPad Prism 5.
RESULTS From n = 378 papers, n = 97 papers were accepted (n = 3 studies contained multiple baseline groups which met inclusion criteria), to give a total of n = 100 records of HRV at baseline. The list of these papers is included as supplementary material. If data was provided, participant age, sample size, HFnu mean and standard deviation (calculated from SEM if necessary), LFnu (likewise), or median and inter-quartile range were recorded separately. LF% and HF% were not recorded, as the inclusion of VLF power within short term calculations is problematic. All forms of spectral analysis (i.e., autoregressive method, FFT/DFT, Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, wavelet analysis etc.) were included as equivalent spectral analytical methods, as normalized units and/or LF/HF ratio were the recorded variables. The characterization of the acceptance/rejection criteria and use of spectral power is shown in Tables 1, 2.
Extraneous controls varied substantially between measures: of the 97 separate studies accepted, 81% controlled for medication or health status, 76% for nicotine use, 58% for time of recording, 45% controlled for food intake, 23% controlled for water intake, and 4% for micturition. Of the above n = 97 studies, 91 (94%) analyzed some version of LF power, and 74 (76%) reported at least one normalized or ratio unit measure. 50 papers speciﬁcally reported the LF/HF ratio: 13/50 (26%) reported log-corrected units and 37/50 (74%) reported uncorrected units.
The time periods used for HRV recording were primarily 5 min (n = 40; 41%), or 10 min (n = 20; 21%). Recording times under 5 min were uncommon (n = 13; 13%), with n = 10 (10%) of these using a measure of LF power.

normalized power. The number of points available for each individual comparison below is noted separately per ﬁgure. Figure 8 shows the means and relevant interquartile values assumed to be precisely equivalent due to equal rank order with the inverseterm regression relating LF/HF and nu units overlaid. Figure 9 describes the sum and interrelationship of normalized values assumed to be precisely equal to unity. The relationship between mean normalized units and mean LF/HF ratio is shown in Figure 10, and their precision is shown in Figure 11.
DISCUSSION Overall, the use of frequency analysis over short-term heart rate recordings to characterize autonomic state or sympathovagal balance is problematic. Relevant research frequently truncates or fails to explain the source of HRV power. Commonly co-investigated variables are reported as separate concepts, but are mathematically redundant as predicted. This redundancy is precise between individual values and moderate between group means. Time periods employed for recording are generally sufﬁcient. Confounding variables which have the potential to substantially alter betweenand within-subject variance are infrequently controlled.
OVERALL PRECISION AND EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL The control of extraneous factors affecting recording in participants is perhaps the most problematic of the results here, because it may irreparably affect the veracity of between-subjects

experimental models. Of course, depending on the circumstances, it may not be possible or even desirable to control all the listed variables—for instance, patient populations must remain on medication, opportunistic recording at any time of day is necessary to observe an episodic phenomenon, etc. However, the fact remains that circadian rhythm, medication, health status, food, water and bladder ﬁlling all potentially possess the ability to modify the variance of a normative group, even if only problematic in a minority of participants. Some of these external factors (medication, health status, and nicotine use) are well controlled, but a minority of work controlled for gastric or bladder ﬁlling. The amount that this affects a normative sample of HRV needs to be determined experimentally.
For experimentation within subjects, the situation is a lot less clear. Obviously, if within-subject measurement involves an intervention over multiple recording periods in time, the potential contamination presents precisely as it would between subjects. However, if a task effect is being observed in sequential recording periods during the same experiment, the problem may be substantially reduced. That is, in the presence of a strong artifact, the absolute or proportional change in HRV in response to a drug, task, intervention etc. may occur reliably but simply from an altered baseline.
Say, for instance, that gastric activity subsequent to feeding increases LF spectral power in an experimental participant

who is then subjected to social stress, which is also expected to increase LF power. If that power rises to a proportional level, i.e., rises by the same absolute or proportional amount that it otherwise would in the absence of feeding, then any potential source of error has been substantially ameliorated by the design.
The problem in this instance would be ampliﬁed if there
was an interaction between the altered baseline and task. If the response is attenuated or ampliﬁed, i.e., there is an interaction between the task effect and the source of artifact, then the situation is concerning, doubly so if a small sample is being used. To a small sample with normative values (e.g., Nunan et al., 2010; LF = 519 ms2, HF = 657 ms2), a mean increase in HF ms2 subsequent to drinking (Routledge et al., 2002; HF +686 ms2) has the potential to destroy the ﬁdelity of an entire measurement at baseline. If this change interacts with any given taskrelated effect, the sample quickly runs the risk of becoming uninterpretable.

NORMALIZED AND LF/HF VARIABLES; CO-REPORTING AND EQUIVALENCE
Co-reporting of equivalent ratio values is reasonably common, observed in over half (59%) of the studies which employed normalized units or LF/HF. The deﬁnition of these measures as redundant is borne out by the results. The argument might be made that this is not problematic, as HRV studies typically employ a range of time and frequency domain measures which are multicollinear. This is impossible to avoid, as most HRV methods some manner of apportioning a meaning to some quantity of the available variance in a heart period series, and cross from time to frequency domain readily as the integral of the total power spectrum is equal to the variance. These interrelationships are often very high—Massin et al. (1999) report, for example, that RMSSD, pNN50 and HF power are mutually correlated above 0.9.
However, there are several problems with this line of argument when applied to multiple ratio measures. It is generally accepted that multiple similar measures of HRV might be employed to the

same end to address the same phenomenon may differ slightly— for example, in a group undergoing an experimental intervention, RMSSD may be signiﬁcantly increased by task and HF power not. Were this the case, the result would be taken as equivocal support for a change in cardiac vagal modulation, and the difference in the result between the similar calculatory methods would be addressed. Alternatively, if LFnu was signiﬁcant and LF/HF not, this might be interpreted as a change in relative sympathetic activity, but no change in sympathovagal balance. Secondly, other measures which may be closely correlated attempt to measure the

same phenomenon but use entirely disparate methods. However, normalized and ratio values are mathematically, not theoretically, related. There is no equivalent transform which might imply, say, an RMSSD value from a value of HF spectral power.
Thirdly, it is unclear which of the ratio measures best represents the comparison they are both attempting to capture. For instance, normalized units are more likely to obey parametric assumptions, but LF/HF may exhibit signiﬁcant skew and kurtosis (Kobayashi et al., 2012). This is directly conﬁrmed in Figure 11, as the relative standard error of both normalized units is substantially lower than LF/HF. If the relationship is mathematically equivalent, and we also accept a degree of measurement error, how should we interpret an instance where one value is signiﬁcant and the other not? Is it inconsistent to report both if one works? If a sample of LF/HF obeys standard parametric assumptions, should it still be log-transformed?
Lastly, it is by no means uncommon for normalized spectral bands and the LF/HF ratio to form the entirety of an analysis in an attempt to measure relative sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions, and their interrelationship. This is rarely the case with other interrelated variables.
NORMALIZED VARIABLES AND UNITY Overall, the predictions from the mathematical equivalence in the introduction were borne out—the curvilinear relationship between normalized and ratio ﬁgures were observed. In some comparisons, however, slight to signiﬁcant departure can be seen contingent on normalized values adding to unity—this was the case for a minority of studies observed, with 4 of the 34 observed sums of LFnu and HFnu below 90%. These departures are reﬂected in Figure 9, and are marked as diamonds between all graphs for continuity.
There are multiple, non-mutually exclusive possibilities for this discontinuity which are not simply calculatory error. The ﬁrst is the use of an alternative deﬁnition of adjusted LF power, i.e., LF/(total power). As the contribution from VLF power is usually

Methodology in HRV

signiﬁcant, this may explain the larger error but not the preponderance of values from 95 to 99% of the sum LFnu + HFnu. The second is that there are small but signiﬁcant contributions to spectral power above 0.4 Hz, which are included in total power but not included as part of the HF frequency band—this might explain the frequent values close to 1, but not the signiﬁcant deviations from it. The third is confusion in the calculation of the autoregressive method between the dominant power components in each spectral band which frequently overlap into the other segments, and the power spectral density of all components but strictly within the deﬁned power band.
This non-equivalence is responsible for the shift in the distribution that can be seen in Figure 9—the bulk of the points are distributed as expected, but lie rightwards of the line of deﬁnition, where the ratio value is slightly bigger than predicted. The regression of the data conforms to this.
It cannot be concluded precisely what this difference represents. The best case scenario for the use of normalized units would be that this difference is borne of the fact that the individual spectral powers retain some statistical independence, and describe a portion of the relevant variance in their spectral bands without absolute covariation.
The worst case scenario is that this is simply a calculatory curiosity which has no speciﬁc meaning, borne of the arbitrary distinction between the whole spectral element (say, the power under the peak which provides the bulk of LF power) and the truncated version (say, the PSD from precisely 0.04 to 0.15 Hz of all components). If the “true” sum of LFnu and HFnu is always 1, then their statistical equivalence is complete—in comparisons, the metrics they return for continuous or directional comparison (e.g., Spearman’s r, Student’s t) to other variables will differ by sign, and F-values not at all. If this is the case, then this error has previously allowed the precise equivalence of LFnu or HFnu to be partially obscured, and normalized/ratio units substantially obscured, by providing values which are somewhat divergent and giving the appearance of independence.
DISPERSION OF RATIO VALUES LF/HF ratio shows an obvious decrease in precision over either normalized variables (Figure 11). This is likely due to the volatility of the LF/HF ratio during normal sympathetic dominance as HF approaches zero, as recently suggested (Billman, 2013). Two examples from the sample set reviewed demonstrate this potential volatility. Muralikrishnan et al. (2012) report a range of autonomic measures on Ishant Yoga practitioners vs. normal controls. At supine rest, the normal sample was described thus: n = 14, μ = 1.86, and SD = 6.35. As LF/HF ratio cannot be less than zero, this sample must contain one or more participants with a ratio of 15 or more, most likely due to HF power being minimal (a common occurrence when breathing rates are slow; see Saboul et al., 2014). As a consequence, the description of this sample by mean and standard deviation is unintelligible, as the distribution has profound positive skew.
Similarly, Chen et al. (2012) compared HRV metrics of resuscitated cardiac arrest patients, patients with sepsis and healthy controls. The raw LF and HF power of healthy controls ranged between approximately 12–100 times greater than all patient

groups. For instance, post-cardiac arrest patients had both LF and HF spectral power of approximately 5 ms2, and healthy controls approximately 100 ms2. As a consequence, both of these groups had a median LF/HF ratio of 1. Alternatively, a difference was found between non-surviving (LF/HF = 0.2) and surviving (LF/HF = 3.1) cardiac arrest patients. However, none of the four spectral powers involved in this calculation had a median above 7.6 ms2.
None of the values above deﬁned by ratio would be meaningful by themselves, and in the context of the original papers are appropriately reported and interpreted with both measures of the raw spectral power and total power. But as seen in Table 2, this is not the case for approximately 30% of published work.
LIMITATIONS There are several limitations to the present work, the most obvious of which is that it makes no attempt to propose a method by which spectral power should be assessed. There are a profound amount of variables to consider regarding such a question; whether spectral assumptions are appropriate in the ﬁrst instance, which variant of spectral analysis is sufﬁcient or optimal, how heartbeat series should be interpolated (if at all), how the series should be corrected (if at all) or windowed, and so forth.
On the same basis, this work records neither outcomes nor differences between free and paced breathing, speciﬁc time of day of recording, or participant age. The data set as reviewed is incapable of sustaining the scale of such a meta-analysis—for instance, Nunan et al. (2010) initially reviewed over 3000 individual pieces of research to draw a sample of n = 44 in which different methods of spectral analysis and the values they return within LF and HF bands could be compared, a requirement to meta-analytically compare regular measures of HRV spectral power to normalized or ratio variables. This relationship would almost certainly interact with the use of HRV to predict, investigate or stratify clinical conditions, as HRV values may be profoundly affected especially by autonomic and circulatory diseases. As a consequence, this work cannot speak to whether normalized or ratio units are capable of sustaining conclusions which are similar to those from raw values. Regardless of the basis on which they are characterized, or their internal consistency, or the manner of their usage, they may still reliably report the same or similar conclusions to other methods.
Finally, this work cannot determine the dispersion of values over the time of day or lifespan, or any relationship between these variables and the methodology used. This would be a worthy topic of future investigation, as HRV is used differentially within particular ﬁelds which are deﬁned by time or age at recording (for instance, chronobiology or antenatal care), and the methodology between them is rarely compared.
CONCLUSION This review has concentrated on commonly used methodology, and hence the internal and external consistency, for collecting HRV by frequency analysis over the short term. In general, the nature of commonly used HRV metrics are not well understood, and these measurement are intimately related both on a mathematical level and in practice. Regardless of this, they

are frequently treated as independent concepts and deployed redundantly. Additionally, insufﬁcient attention is paid to the environment of data collection. None of these are trivial concerns; rather, they call into question the accuracy of the existing literature on HRV and warrant the re-establishment of an authoritative source for correct methodology and practice.

The LF/HF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho-vagal balance

Power spectral analysis of the beat-tobeat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reﬂect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are

assumed to reﬂect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.
The hypothesis that LF/HF accurately reﬂects sympatho-vagal balance rests upon several interrelated assumptions as follows (modiﬁed from Eckberg, 1997): (1) cardiac sympathetic nerve activity is a major, if not the exclusive, factor responsible for the LF peak of the heart rate power spectrum; (2) cardiac parasympathetic is exclusively responsible for the HF peak of the heart rate power spectrum; (3) disease or physiological challenges provoke reciprocal changes in cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity (i.e., increases in cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity are always accompanied with corresponding reductions in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and vice versa); and (4) there is a simple linear interaction between the effects of cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity on heart rate variability (HRV).
As previously noted, frequency domain analysis of HRV usually reveals two or more peaks, a lower frequency (<015 Hz) and a higher frequency peak (>0.15 Hz) that are often assumed to correspond to cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic neural activity, respectively (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991). However, accumulating evidence clearly demonstrates that this assumption is naïve and greatly oversimpliﬁes the complex non-linear interactions between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (Berntson et al., 1997; Eckberg, 1997; Parati et al., 2006; Billman, 2009, 2011). This is particularly true with regards to the relationship between LF power and

cardiac sympathetic regulation (Randall et al., 1991; Ahmed et al., 1994; Kingwell et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Parati et al., 2006; Billman, 2009, 2011).
The LF peak of the heart rate power spectrum is reduced by at least 50% by either cholinergic antagonists or selective parasympathectomy (Akselrod et al., 1981; Randall et al., 1991; Houle and Billman, 1999). Importantly, this peak is not completely eliminated by the combination of selective denervation and betaadrenoceptor blockade (Randall et al., 1991); ∼25% of the peak remains after this treatment. As a consequence, LF/HF often actually increases from baseline values when both parasympathetic and adrenergic nerve activity have been blocked. For example, using the data reported by Randall and co-workers (Randall et al., 1991), LF/HF increased from a baseline value of 1.1–8.4 when selective parasympathetic denervation was combined with beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, falsely suggesting a major shift to sympathetic dominance! In a similar manner, interventions that would be expected to increase cardiac sympathetic activity, such as acute exercise or myocardial ischemia, not only failed to increase LF power but actually provoked signiﬁcant reductions in this variable (Houle and Billman, 1999), once again yielding LF/HF values that are difﬁcult to interpret. Indeed, despite large increases in heart rate, LF/HF ratio was largely unaffected by either acute myocardial ischemia, exercise, or the cholinergic antagonist atropine sulfate (Houle and Billman, 1999). Finally, direct recording of sympathetic nerve activity failed to correlate with LF power in either healthy subjects or patients with heart failure (Hopf et al., 1995; Notarius and Floras, 2001; Jardine et al., 2002; Moak et al.,

LF/HF and autonomic balance

2007; Piccirillo et al., 2009), a condition known to increase cardiac sympathetic drive (Hasking et al., 1986; Saul et al., 1988; Watson et al., 2007). Thus, the LF component of HRV does not provide an index of cardiac sympathetic drive but rather reﬂects a complex and not easily discernible mix of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and other unidentiﬁed factors with parasympathetic factors accounting for the largest portion of the variability in this frequency range. As a consequence, the physiological basis for LF/HF is difﬁcult to discern.
Although the vast majority of the clinical and the experimental studies demonstrate a strong association between HF power and cardiac parasympathetic activity (Katona et al., 1970; Appel et al., 1989; Billman and Hoskins, 1989; Billman and Dujardin, 1990; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Billman, 2009, 2011; Thayler et al., 2010), this concept has also been challenged (Kollai and Mizsei, 1990; Goldberger et al., 1994; Hedman et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 2001; Parati et al., 2006). Unlike LF power and sympathetic nerve activity, a strong correlation between HF power and direct recordings of cardiac parasympathetic activity has been reported (Chess et al., 1975; Piccirillo et al., 2009). However, just as parasympathetic activation exerts profound inﬂuences on the LF component of HRV, sympathetic neural activity may modulate the HF component of the R–R interval variability (Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002). Taylor et al. (2001) found that cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (drugs that should not indirectly alter vagal outﬂow via action within the central nervous system) increased the amplitude of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia over a wide range of respiratory frequencies (i.e., the increases were not restricted to lower frequencies, <0.15 Hz). They concluded that “cardiac sympathetic outﬂow can oppose vagally mediated R-R interval oscillations and sympathetic blockade removes this effect” (Cohen and Taylor, 2002). Based upon these data, sympathetic nerve activation may alter the HF peak by perhaps as much as 10%. Thus, differences in cardiac sympathetic activation during a physiological challenge (e.g., exercise or postural changes) in healthy subjects or

that occur as the consequence of cardiovascular disease (following myocardial infarction) could restrain vagally mediated changes in HRV. These data suggest that HF power cannot be solely attributed to changes in cardiac vagal efferent nerve trafﬁc, further compromising an accurate interpretation of the LF/HF ratio.
Accurate interpretation of LF/HF ratio also depends upon the assumption that physiological interventions always elicit reciprocal changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity. However, following the termination of exercise sympathetic activation remains high despite the rapid re-activation of cardiac parasympathetic drive (Smith et al., 2005; Billman and Kukielka, 2007; Billman, 2009). Furthermore, chemoreceptor activation by carbon dioxide provokes parallel reductions in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity (Eckberg, 1997) while facial emersion in cold water (activating the so-called “diving reﬂex”) increased sympathetic nerve activity yet elicited a profound bradycardia (Eckberg et al., 1984; Fagius and Sundlof, 1986). The observation that heart rate declines, despite increases in sympathetic nerve activity, highlights the complex non-linear interactions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, providing an example of “accentuated antagonism” (Levy, 1971; Stramba-Badiale et al., 1991; Uijtdehaage and Thayer, 2000), the dominance of parasympathetic over sympathetic inﬂuences on cardiac rate. Finally, reciprocal changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity do not always occur even during the activation of the baroreceptor reﬂex (Eckberg, 1997). Eckberg and co-workers have shown that, although small changes in arterial pressure typically provoke reciprocal changes sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, large increases in arterial pressure only provoke increases in parasympathetic nerve activity without altering the prevailing sympathetic activity (Eckberg, 1980; Rea and Eckberg, 1987). Furthermore, autonomic response to baroreceptor reﬂex activation depends on whether the pressure changes occur near the threshold or the saturation point of the response curve; the same change in pressure can elicit larger or smaller autonomic responses depending on how close the prevailing pressure lies to the threshold (larger)

or saturation (smaller) portion of the stimulus-response curve (Eckberg, 1980, 1997). As previously noted, changes in heart rate do not result from the simple algebraic summation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity. Rather, parasympathetic nerve activation can completely override even maximal sympathetic nerve stimulation, provoking large reductions in heart rate in the face of sympathetic nerve activation as was previously noted for the diving reﬂex. Thus, physiological interventions can elicit either complex non-linear reciprocal or parallel changes in either division of the autonomic nervous system. These complex interactions can profoundly inﬂuence the calculation and the interpretation of LF/HF.
Mathematical considerations can also inﬂuence LF/HF values. Similar LF/HF values can be obtained via either exclusive changes in the numerator (i.e., LF), or the dominator (i.e., HF), or by some combination of the two, as is illustrated in Table 1. For example, a doubling of parasympathetic activity against maintained sympathetic nerve activation yields the identical LF/HF value as a 50% reduction in sympathetic nerve activity against a constant background parasympathetic regulation. Based upon the literature, one can conclude that parasympathetic nerve activation contributes to at least 50% of the LF variability while sympathetic activity, at best, only contributes 25% to this variability (Randall et al., 1991). A substantial portion of the variability in the LF band also results from other unidentiﬁed factors. In a similar fashion, sympathetic nerve activity could contribute to perhaps as much as 10% of the HF variability (Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002). As a consequence, the effects of changing sympathetic and parasympathetic activity on the LF/HF are quite variable and not intuitively obvious, as is illustrated in Figure 1. This ﬁgure was constructed using the following formula that was based upon a synthesis of the literature (particularly, Randall et al., 1991; Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002), LF = 0.5 parasympathetic + 0.25 sympathetic activity while HF = 0.9 parasympathetic + 0.1 sympathetic nerve activity. The nerve activity was varied from baseline (1 arbitrary unit each) increasing or decreasing by up to a

These numbers were generated using the following formula (derived from a synthesis of the literature, particularly Randall et al., 1991; Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002): LF/HF = (0.5 parasympathetic + 0.25 sympathetic nerve activity)/(0.9 parasympathetic + 0.1 sympathetic nerve activity). The nerve activity is reported as arbitrary units where at baseline sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity were normalized as 1 arbitrary unit each. The data shown are for baseline and various combinations of doubling (2 × baseline) or halving (0.5 × baseline) the autonomic nerve activity.

FIGURE 1 | An illustration of the possible non-linear effects of varying cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity on LF/HF. This graph was constructed using the following formula (derived from a synthesis of the literature, particularly Randall et al., 1991; Taylor et al., 2001; Cohen and Taylor, 2002): LF/HF = (0.5 parasympathetic + 0.25 sympathetic nerve activity)/(0.9 parasympathetic + 0.1 sympathetic nerve activity). The nerve activity was varied from baseline (1 arbitrary unit each) increasing or decreasing by up to a factor of 10 (i.e., from 0.1 to 10 units).

factor of 10. Due to the substantial contribution (accounting for up to 25% of the variability) (Randall et al., 1991) from non-neural factors to LF power, very distorted values of LF/HF can be obtained when both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity are minimal. If for example, one assumes that LF = 0.5

parasympathetic + 0.25 sympathetic + 0.25 other factors and both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve activity are reduced to 1/100 the baseline values, the calculated LF/HF becomes (0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.25)/(0.009 + 0.001) = 25.75! Despite the almost complete absence of cardiac autonomic regulation, this value

could be inappropriately interpreted as a major shift toward sympathetic dominance. Furthermore, LF/HF cannot be determined if both sympathetic activity and parasympathetic nerve activity were to be abolished completely (i.e., when the dominator is zero). Finally, mathematical complications also arise due to the nonlinear relationship between R–R interval and heart rate; similar changes in heart rate elicit much greater variability in R– R interval at lower than at higher heart rates (Sacha and Pluta, 2008). As a consequence of this non-linear relationship, it is difﬁcult to separate the changes in HRV that arise from direct action of cardiac autonomic nerves from those changes that result indirectly from neurally induced changes in average heart rate. This observation led Sacha and Pluta (2008), to propose that HRV has both physiological and mathematical inﬂuences that can be corrected by the division of HRV by average R–R interval. Thus, the physiological basis for changes in LF/HF is not readily discernible and spurious values for LF/HF can result as a consequence of the mathematical manipulations of the data.
It should also be noted, that HRV (and thereby LF/HF) is affected by respiratory parameters and mechanical events independent of changes in cardiac autonomic nerve activity. The contribution of mechanical factors (due to stretch of the atria that results from both changes in cardiac ﬁlling and the changing thoracic pressure that occur during respiration) to changes in HRV was ﬁrst proposed by Bainbridge (1930). This conclusion is supported by the observation that heart transplant patients, despite the absence of cardiac nerves, still exhibit small (∼2–8% of normal) change in R–R interval associated with the respiratory cycle (Bernardi et al., 1989). Taylor et al. (2001) further demonstrated that atrial stretch can exert signiﬁcant inﬂuences on R–R interval in subjects with complete autonomic blockade. They found that after combined cholinergic and adrenergic receptor blockade slow deep breathing could still provoke oscillations of ∼120 ms in healthy human subjects (Taylor et al., 2001). In similar manner, mechanical distortion (stretch) of the sinoatrial nodal stretch in pigs without functional autonomic innervation (vagal nerve section combined with propranolol

treatment) reduced the HF component of HRV (Horner et al., 1996).
Respiratory parameters can also profoundly alter heart rate and R–R interval variability independent of changes in cardiac autonomic regulation (i.e., against a constant background level of automatic regulation) (Angelone and Coulter, 1964; Davies and Neilson, 1967; Hainsworth, 1974; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993; Van De Borne et al., 2001). It is now well established that increases in respiratory frequency reduce the amplitude of heart rate oscillations (Angelone and Coulter, 1964; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993) while either increases in tidal (Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg, 1983; Kollai and Mizsei, 1990; Brown et al., 1993) or static lung volume (Hainsworth, 1974) provoke increases in the R–R interval variability. The facts are in direct opposiiton to the assumptions. Conversely, reductions in respiratory frequency increase HRV (Angelone and Coulter, 1964; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Brown et al., 1993) while decreases in tidal volume lead to reductions in the R–R interval variability (Davies and Neilson, 1967; Melcher, 1976; Hirsch and Bishop, 1981; Eckberg, 1983; Kollai and Mizsei, 1990; Brown et al., 1993). Thus, it is critical to control breathing (paced or timed breathing) in order to interpret HRV data accurately. For obvious reasons, it is much more difﬁcult to control respiratory parameters in conscious animal than in human studies. However, these respiratory parameters frequently are not controlled even in human studies (Brown et al., 1993). Brown and co-workers (Brown et al., 1993), reviewed the human literature and found that only about 51% controlled respiratory rate, and even fewer studies controlled for tidal volume (11%). They further reported that respiratory parameters not only altered HF power but also strongly inﬂuenced the LF components of the R–R interval power spectrum, a component that previously was viewed to vary independently of changes in respiration (Brown et al., 1993).
Finally, prevailing heart rate can also inﬂuence HRV. There are a number of studies that report a strong positive correlation between mean R–R interval and

various time domain indices of HRV (e.g., the standard deviation of normal beats, SDNN) (Kleiger et al., 1987; Van Hoogenhuyze et al., 1991; Fleiss et al., 1992) such that HRV was greater during longer mean R–R intervals (slower heart rates) than at shorter mean R–R intervals (faster heart rates). Frequency domain analysis of HRV is similarly affected by mean heart rate. Sacha and Pluta (2005) found that LF was directly related, while HF was indirectly related, to the average heart rate of the subject. As a consequence, they further report that LF/HF varied depending on heart rate, lower at slower and higher at faster heart rates. Thus, heart rate per se can inﬂuence LF/HF independent of changes cardiac autonomic nerve activity.
As we have seen, the hypothesis that LF/HF quantiﬁes “sympatho-vagal balance” depends upon four interrelated assumptions, all of which can be proven to be false. The facts are in direct opposition to the assumptions. In particular, the complex nature of LF power, its exceedingly poor relationship to sympathetic nerve activation, and the non-linear (and often non-reciprocal) interactions between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity that are confounded by the mechanical effects of respiration and prevailing heart rate, make it impossible to delineate the physiological basis for LF/HF with any degree of certainty. Thus, the LF/HF sympatho-vagal balance hypothesis has been disproven—the preponderance of evidence conﬁrms that LF/HF data cannot accurately quantify cardiac “sympatho-vagal balance” either in health or disease.

Heart rate (HR) variability has been extensively studied in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The majority of studies have shown that patients with reduced or abnormal HR variability/turbulence have an increased risk of mortality within few years after an AMI. Various measures of HR dynamics, such as time-domain, spectral, and non-linear measures of HR variability, as well as HR turbulence, have been used in risk stratiﬁcation of post-AMI patients. The prognostic power of various measures, except of those reﬂecting rapid R–R interval oscillations, has been almost identical, albeit some non-linear HR variability measures, such as short-term fractal scaling exponent, and HR turbulence, have provided somewhat better prognostic information than the others. Abnormal HR variability predicts both sudden and non-sudden cardiac death after AMI. Because of remodeling of the arrhythmia substrate after AMI, early measurement of HR variability to identify those at high risk should likely be repeated later in order to assess the risk of fatal arrhythmia events. Future randomized trials using HR variability/turbulence as one of the pre-deﬁned inclusion criteria will show whether routine measurement of HR variability/turbulence will become a routine clinical tool for risk stratiﬁcation of post-AMI patients.
Keywords: mortality, coronary artery disease, sudden cardiac death

The purpose of this mini-review is to discuss the role of measurement of heart rate (HR) variability in patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), especially its potential or proven clinical utility, by itself or in combination with other variables. Studies will be reviewed that employed a large variety of HR variability measures, with the majority derived from easily obtainable 24-h recordings.
Clinical utility is, of course, a broad concept. In this review, we will consider a measure to have clinical utility, if it identiﬁes patients at higher risk of an adverse outcome, differentiates those with more advanced from those with less advanced disease, identiﬁes those who would beneﬁt from interventions or identiﬁes those who are beneﬁting from or being harmed by an intervention. HR variability has been applied in a huge number of studies. We have chosen to limit our review to main studies focusing on clinical application of HR variability measurements from 24-h Holter recordings in patients who have survived an AMI.
BACKGROUND FOR ABNORMAL HR VARIABILITY Heart rate variability is a term that encompasses a large number of measures of different types that have been described in details in other articles of this Special Topic of the journal. Timedomain measures reﬂect “how much” HRV there is. In general, if such measures are extremely low, it can be assumed that there is true autonomic dysfunction, but higher values for these various measures could reﬂect more healthy autonomic function or an unhealthy, highly irregular HR pattern (erratic rhythm). Frequency domain measures have the same properties. Extremely

low values are associated with a lack of autonomic modulation of HR, but higher values, without examination of their underlying organization using power spectral plots or other graphical methods, cannot be assumed to reﬂect better HR variability. Nonlinear measures like the short-term fractal scaling exponent and the power–law slope, appear to better differentiate between healthy and unhealthy organization of the heart’s rhythm and have proved to be more sensitive for risk stratiﬁcation that some of the standard measures (Bigger et al., 1996; Huikuri et al., 2000). HR turbulence, which was covered recently in detail (Bauer et al., 2008), also appears to be sensitive to autonomic dysfunction, especially to impaired baroreﬂex function. It is likely that the optimal characterization of normal and abnormal HR variability would be based on a combination of these different HR variability parameters rather than on a single one.
PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF HR VARIABILITY AFTER AMI The prognostic signiﬁcance of HR variability has been extensively studied in patients who have survived an AMI. Table 1 summarizes the results of main studies assessing the prognostic signiﬁcance of HR variability measurements from 24-h recordings. As early as Wolf et al. (1978) showed that patients with a low magnitude of short-term HR variability (no sinus arrhythmia on 30 consecutive R–R intervals on admitting ECG) had a poor prognosis after AMI. In the late 1980s, the multicenter post-infarction project (MPIP) conﬁrmed the predictive value of reduced HRV by measuring 24-h SD of N–N intervals (SDNN) over 24 h following AMI (Kleiger et al., 1987). Adjustment for covariates did not explain

this association. Other studies (including a reanalysis of MPIP) have shown that spectral measures of HR variability, mainly the very-low and low frequency spectral components, are reduced in survivors of AMI and that decreased values are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (Bigger et al., 1992).
Because accurate Holter scanning is relatively labor intensive, the group at St. George’s hospital in London experimented with global, geometric indices of HR variability (HR variability index) that were derived from the histogram of N–N intervals (Malik

et al., 1989). Decreased values for these measures were also found to be associated with higher risk of mortality (Fei et al., 1996). In addition, this group suggested that markedly reduced SDNN for a single, stable 5-min period could pre-select patients in whom 24-h Holter recordings using geometric methods would provide signiﬁcant risk stratiﬁcation.
The autonomic tone and reﬂexes after myocardial infarction (ATRAMI) trial was a multicenter observational study performed about 10 years after MPIP. The ATRAMI investigators conﬁrmed

that reduced 24-h SDNN (<70 ms in this case) is associated with an increased mortality during 21 months of follow up (La Rovere et al., 1998). Furthermore, the combination of low SDNN and left ventricular ejection fraction <35% carried a high risk of mortality.
Early studies focused on measurement of HR variability relatively early after AMI. Measures of HR variability appeared to be more depressed at the early phase of AMI with substantial improvement during recovery (Jokinen et al., 2003). Despite this autonomic recovery, measurement of HR variability has been shown to yield similar prognostic information when the 24-h HRV measurements were performed late after AMI (Bigger et al., 1993; Jokinen et al., 2003).
The post-MI studies performed in the 1980s and 1990s used 24h time and frequency domain as well as geometric measures of HR variability for risk stratiﬁcation of patients after AMI. Although all statistical, geometrical, and spectral measures of HR variability differ in their manner of computation and analysis, these methods are fundamentally based on moment statistics and describe the magnitude of HR variability or of its underlying components. It is therefore not surprising that most of these measures that have been shown to have prognostic value have relatively close mutual correlation, and that there are only minor differences in prognostic power between them. It must be kept in mind though that measures of beat-to-beat HR variability which are supposed to reﬂect respiratory related vagal control of HR (HF power, pNN50, rMSSD) have rarely shown a strong association with outcome. This is likely because of the high prevalence of erratic rhythm in these populations resulting in higher measures for these parameters that do not reﬂect better parasympathetic function. One study showed that when erratic short-term R–R intervals was excluded from the analysis, HR variability related to respiratory cycles predicted sudden cardiac death even better than the standard HR variability indexes (Peltola et al., 2008).
More recent studies have applied methods based on HR turbulence, non-linear dynamic, and maximum deceleration capacity of R–R intervals, which provide very different and perhaps complementary information on HR dynamics compared to traditional statistical methods (Mäkikallio et al., 2002; Bauer et al., 2006, 2008). Methods based on non-linear dynamics and HR turbulence have provided somewhat better prognostic information than that obtained by traditional methods (Bauer et al., 2006, 2008; Perkiömäki et al., 2008). In particular, decreased short-term fractal scaling exponent by the DFA method (called DFA1 or α1), a measure of greater randomness in HR patterns, has turned out to be a powerful non-linear index in risk stratiﬁcation, a more powerful prognostic tool than other HR variability indexes in post-AMI populations (Huikuri et al., 2000; Mäkikallio et al., 2002). In the DIAMOND-MI trial, reduced short-term fractal scaling exponent identiﬁed post-AMI patients at a relative high risk of mortality and was more strongly related to outcome than traditional time and frequency domain measures (Huikuri et al., 2000). Moreover, reduced scaling exponent was related to both arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality (Huikuri et al., 2000). In another study of consecutive patients with acute MI, both reduced short-term fractal scaling exponent and power–law slope were independently associated with recurrent non-fatal coronary events (Perkiömäki

et al., 2008). Another measure of increased randomness of HR patterns, such as the ratio of the axes of a Poincare plot ﬁtted to the plot of each N–N interval vs. the next, also predicted mortality in the CAST trial (Stein et al., 2005). Patients in the CAST were at variable times post-MI but were selected for having signiﬁcant ventricular arrhythmias.
One study in the era of modern therapy showed a very-low incidence of severely depressed HR variability (SDNN <50 ms; Erdogan et al., 2008). All patients in the study were treated with direct percutaneous coronary angioplasty within 12 h of their event. Although the 4-year survival was signiﬁcantly higher in the low SDNN group, the positive predictive value was low, suggesting that the predictive power of HR variability may not be as high as earlier in patients receiving optimal medical and revascularization therapy. However, results were based on traditional time-domain HR variability measures and there was no report of results for non-linear measures or HR turbulence in this population.
HR VARIABILITY AS A PREDICTOR OF ARRHYTHMIC EVENTS/SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH The studies assessing the prognostic power of HR variability after AMI have usually used all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint (see Table 1). Some studies, using various deﬁnitions of arrhythmic events in their designs, have suggested that reduced or altered HR variability may be speciﬁcally related to arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death. However, the clinical applicability of measurement of HR variability as a predictor of fatal arrhythmic events was challenged in a randomized prophylactic implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD) trial, the deﬁbrillator in AMI trial (DYNAMIT) which, however, used reduced SDNN combined with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction measured early (within 2 weeks) after AMI as an inclusion criterion for the trial. The trial could not show any mortality beneﬁt from ICD therapy in these presumably high risk patients (Hohnloser et al., 2004). The more recent multicenter cardiac arrhythmias and risk stratiﬁcation after myocardial infarction (CARISMA) study showed that reduced HR variability measured relatively late (6 weeks after AMI) rather than early after AMI, especially the very-low frequency spectral component, was the most powerful index among many other non-invasive risk markers in predicting the fatal or near-fatal arrhythmic events diagnosed by implantable arrhythmia devices (Huikuri et al., 2009). A further sub analysis of the CARISMA and another recent similar study (Risk estimation after infarction, non-invasive evaluation, REFINE) study conﬁrmed that HR variability and HR turbulence yield more powerful prognostic information for arrhythmic events when measured late (6–10 weeks after AMI) rather than early (within 2 weeks) after AMI in the current treatment era (Huikuri et al., 2010). Thus the lack of recovery from reduced autonomic function after AMI was a stronger predictor of adverse events than decreased autonomic function early after AMI. A large study including more than 2000 post-AMI patients (FINGER-study) showed that reduced HR variability and HR turbulence predicted sudden cardiac death better among those with a left ventricular ejection fraction >40% than in those with ejection fraction <40% (Mäkikallio et al., 2005).

Hear rate variability post-MI

HR VARIABILITY AS A PREDICTOR OF NON-SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH Observational studies using various end-points have shown that reduced HR variability also predicts non-sudden cardiac death. The largest study in this ﬁeld showed that reduced HR variability/turbulence is in fact a stronger predictor of non-sudden than sudden cardiac death (Mäkikallio et al., 2005). In this study, the majority of patients were treated according to current guidelines, i.e., with primary coronary interventions, beta-blocking medication, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
Considered together, the available data show that abnormal HR variability, measured by various time and frequency domain measures, non-linear measures, and turbulence/deceleration capacity measures from 24-h R–R interval recordings is a general risk marker for common modes of cardiac death: arrhythmic, vascular, and hemodynamic after AMI. HR variability/turbulence measured early after AMI seems to provide more powerful information on the risk of early non-sudden cardiac death, especially due to progressive heart failure. Because of remodeling of the arrhythmia substrate after AMI, early measurement of HR variability to identify those at high risk of early mortality should likely be repeated later in order to assess the true risk of fatal or near-fatal arrhythmia events.
Often forgotten, however, in this focus on risk stratiﬁcation, is the negative predictive value of HR variability measures. Patients with normal HR variability measures, even if they are post-MI, are at very-low risk of mortality. However, as has been found with other non-invasive risk markers, the positive predictive accuracy and sensitivity of abnormal HR variability for adverse outcomes has remained low in most observational studies. The sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and predictive values of HR variability in predicting future events depend partly on deﬁning the cutoff points of abnormal HR variability measures. The cutoff points vary between the studies and depend on the study populations, such as post-AMI patients with and without heart failure, usage of beta-blocking medication etc., which inﬂuence the HR variability measures, and there is no universal consensus on the ideal cutoffs for different measures. Age and presence of diabetes and even clinical depression are other factors inﬂuencing HR variability and should be considered in deﬁning the cutoff of abnormal measures. HR variability has been combined with other risk markers in order to improve risk stratiﬁcation in some studies. The problem with combining various risk markers, however, is the overall loss of sensitivity despite an improved positive predictive accuracy.
EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS ON HR VARIABILITY Finally, little is known about the effect of interventions on HR variability in post-AMI patients and about whether interventions that are associated with improvements in HR variability are associated with better outcomes or vice versa. One intervention, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is associated

with markedly decreased HR variability which slowly improves over weeks and months (Stein et al., 2004). It is likely that any predictive value for long-term outcomes contained in traditional time and frequency domain HR variability is lost once the patient has undergone CABG surgery. However, two studies have shown that measurements of non-linear HRV parameters after CABG surgery did identify those at higher risk of a complicated post-surgical course (Laitio et al., 2000; de Godoy et al., 2009). Only one trial, the BHAT (Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial) examined change in HR variability with therapy and the subsequent relationship of HR variability to mortality (Lampert et al., 2003). In BHAT, patients randomized to propranolol had a signiﬁcantly greater increase in HF power at 6-weeks and after 21 months of follow up, higher HR variability at 6 weeks and assignment to the beta-blocker arm were independent predictors of a combined endpoint. On the other hand, anti-arrhythmic therapies that proved to be associated with reduced survival have been associated with negative effects on HR variability. In a meta-analysis of the effect of pharmacologic, behavioral, and exercise strategies on HR variability, Nolan et al. (2008) concluded that these secondary preventive strategies have a moderate but signiﬁcant positive effect on HR variability. However, none of the large-scale studies on post-MI patients conducted so far have shown that improvement of HR variability by any of the therapeutic interventions would be associated with better outcome.
FUTURE CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS Future research in this ﬁeld should focus on randomized trials that take into consideration the timing of HR variability/turbulence measurement after AMI in their study designs. Information from such trials may identify the populations in which the clinical applicability of routine measurement of HR variability is warranted. Measurement of the evolution of HR variability over time in association with prescribed therapies, perhaps on an individual basis, may also add to the clinical value of HR variability. Measures of HR variability should be combined with other clinical risk variables or biomarkers, in future studies to create risk scoring for post-AMI patients based on multiple risk factors. Currently, ongoing study (REFINE–ICD), where patients with reduced HR turbulence, abnormal time-domain T-wave alternans, and left ventricular ejection fraction between 35 and 50% measured 2–14 months after AMI are being randomized to ICD therapy (ICD) and standard therapy (personal communication). If mortality beneﬁt is observed in the ICD arm of this trial, measurement of HR turbulence will become a routine clinical tool for a large number of post-AMI patients. Before the completion of the trial or other similar trials, patients with low HR variability/turbulence after AMI should receive the best available medical and invasive therapy, rehabilitation, and follow-up, even if routine measurements of HR variability/turbulence cannot yet be recommended in clinical practice guidelines.

Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is the baroreﬂex-mediated short-term oscillation of cardiac cycle lengths after spontaneous ventricular premature complexes. HRT is composed of a brief heart rate acceleration followed by a gradual heart rate deceleration. In high risk patients after myocardial infarction (MI) HRT is blunted or diminished. Since its ﬁrst description in 1999 HRT emerged as one of the most potent risk factors after MI. Predictive power of HRT has been studied in more than 10,000 post-infarction patients. This review is intended to provide an overview of HRT as risk-predictor after MI.
Keywords: autonomic function, heart rate turbulence, myocardial infarction, risk stratiﬁcation, sudden death

INTRODUCTION Despite signiﬁcant advances in interventional and medical therapy late mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) is still high. A substantial number of these late deaths occur suddenly, potentially preventable by an implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD). Randomized multicenter trials have shown that mortality can be reduced in post-infarction patients at high risk for death by 20– 54% (Moss et al., 1996, 2002; Buxton et al., 1999; Bristow et al., 2004; Bardy et al., 2005). Current guidelines recommend ICD implantation in patients characterized by a compromised left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 30–35%) which is considered to be the gold standard in risk prediction (Gregoratos et al., 2002; Zipes et al., 2006).
However, clinical studies have consistently shown that the criterion of a reduced LVEF is neither sensitive nor speciﬁc. It lacks of sensitivity as approximately 2/3 of deaths in post-infarction patients occur in patients with LVEF >35% who are not covered by the criterion of reduced LVEF (Myerburg et al., 1997, 1998; Huikuri et al., 2001; Buxton, 2003). It also lacks of speciﬁcity as 11 ICDs have to be implanted to save one life (Camm et al., 2007). The majority of ICD recipients will never receive an adequate shock. Therefore, development of additional risk stratiﬁcation strategies is urgently needed.
Twelve years ago, an electrocardiographic phenomenon later on termed “heart rate turbulence (HRT)” has been described (Schmidt et al., 1999). At that time, it has been ﬁrstly recognized that in healthy persons spontaneous ventricular premature complexes (VPC) are followed by a characteristic short-term oscillation of heart rate. The oscillation is composed of a brief heart rate acceleration followed by a gradual heart rate deceleration before returning to baseline. As post-ectopic changes of cycle lengths are in the range of milliseconds and masked by heart rate variability of other origin it can only be visualized by signal averaging.

Very early it became clear that post-infarction patients at increased risk for adverse events showed different postextrasystolic patterns of heart rate. In high risk patients the typical HRT response is blunted or entirely missing. Within the last decade, HRT emerged as one of the most potent ECG based risk predictors. Several large-scale studies have demonstrated its strong prognostic power in post-infarction patients. This review is intended to provide a review of HRT as risk-predictor in post-infarction patients.

MEASUREMENT OF HEART RATE TURBULENCE Heart rate turbulence is obtained from standard 24-h Holter recordings with a minimum temporal resolution of 128 Hz which allow for accurate determinations of RR intervals and beat classiﬁcations. In contrast to other techniques such as T-wave alternans no speciﬁc electrodes or other equipments are needed. The technical assessment of HRT has been described in details elsewhere (Bauer et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, the RR intervals surrounding spontaneous VPCs are averaged in order to obtain a so-called local tachogram demasking the average pattern of sinus RR intervals surrounding VPCs (Figure 1). VPCs used for HRT computation need to fulﬁll certain criteria with respect to prematurity and compensatory pause. Details regarding these ﬁlter criteria have been described elsewhere (Bauer et al., 2008).
The two phases of HRT are quantiﬁed by the two parameters turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS).
Turbulence onset is calculated as follows:

two RR intervals which immediately follow the compensatory pause. TS is deﬁned as the maximum positive regression slope assessed over any ﬁve consecutive sinus RR intervals within the ﬁrst 15 RR intervals following the VPC. Hence, in normal subjects, the initial acceleration of sinus rate after the VPC is characterized by negative TO and the following heart rate deceleration is characterized by positive TS. TO <0% and TS >2.5 ms/RR interval are considered normal (Bauer et al., 2008).
For use of risk stratiﬁcation in different patient populations, HRT is usually divided into three categories: (1) HRT category 0 is deﬁned as normal TO and normal TS, (2) HRT category 1 means that either TO or TS are abnormal, and (3) HRT category 2 is characterized by both abnormal TO and TS. If no sufﬁcient VPC tachograms are recorded and patients are otherwise in sinus rhythm, HRT is classiﬁed as category 0 since those patients were shown to have equally good prognosis as patients with normal HRT (Barthel et al., 2003). As

this was only shown for post-infarction patients, this approach might not be valid if other pathologies (e.g., heart failure) are considered.
The HRT software is commercially available on GE and Getemed Holter systems. However, as the algorithms have been published in detail (www.h-r-t.com) HRT can also be obtained from the series of RR intervals by a custom-made software.
PHYSIOLOGY OF HEART RATE TURBULENCE When the ﬁrst clinical studies of HRT in risk prediction have been published the exact physiological mechanisms behind HRT were largely unknown (Schmidt et al., 1999; Bauer and Schmidt, 2007). The (patho)physiological mechanisms behind HRT are complex and involve both branches of the autonomic nervous system. In their work, Wichterle et al. (2006) provide an excellent review of HRT physiology. The VPC induces a transient drop of arterial blood pressure which leads to an activation of the baroreceptors. Vagal activity is abruptly withdrawn resulting in an almost

immediate shortening of RR interval cycle lengths (as measured by TO). However, also the sympathetic system reacts (Segerson et al., 2007). Increased sympathetic activity results in a gradual increase of vascular resistance and systolic arterial blood pressure. As consequence, vagal activity reestablishes and cycle lengths prolong (as measured by TS). Importantly, HRT requires an intact interplay of both, vagal and sympathetic systems. Absence of normal HRT can be caused by an alteration in one of the systems (Wichterle et al., 2006).
HRT STUDY POPULATIONS Evidence of HRT as risk-predictor in post-infarction patients is based on ﬁve retrospective and ﬁve prospective studies including a total of more than 10,000 patients. Study characteristics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Heart rate turbulence was originally developed in a small dataset comprising of 100 patients suffering from coronary artery disease and subsequently validated in a blinded fashion in the cohorts of the MPIP study (n = 577) and the placebo arm of the EMIAT study (n = 614; Schmidt et al., 1999). Two years later, Ghuran et al. (2002) tested the predictive power of HRT in the dataset of the ATRAMI study (n = 1,212) which was originally designed to assess the prognostic power of baroreﬂex sensitivity. Another 3 years later, predictive power of HRT was also tested in the dataset

of the CAST study (n = 744; Hallstrom et al., 2005). The FINGER study combined a Finish and German post-infarction population (Barthel et al., 2003; Huikuri et al., 2003) to speciﬁcally address the question whether HRT predicts sudden death (Makikallio et al., 2005).
In 2003, the results of the ﬁrst prospective study ISAR-HRT (n = 1,455) were published which was designed to validate the prognostic value of HRT in a large cohort of post-infarction patients receiving contemporary treatment (Barthel et al., 2003). The REFINE study (n = 322) published 2007 was designed to assess the predictive value of a combination of several risk predictors including HRT as well as the time of their assessment after acute MI (Exner et al., 2007). In 2009, the results of the largest prospective HRT study were published. ISARRISK tested the prognostic value of a combination of HRT and deceleration capacity (Bauer et al., 2006a) in post-infarction patients with preserved LVEF (Bauer et al., 2009a). Deceleration capacity is an integral measure of all deceleration related modulations of heart rate observed over 24 h and thus, most presumably, a measure of tonic vagal activity. The CARISMA study (n = 312) deserves special attention as loop recorders have been implanted in all patients to speciﬁcally address the endpoint of severe arrhythmic events (Huikuri et al., 2009). Very recently, the results of ISAR-SWEET have been published

which tested the combination of abnormal HRT and deceleration capacity in diabetic post-infarction patients (Barthel et al., 2011).
RISK PREDICTIVE POWER OF HRT IN POST-INFARCTION PATIENTS In all populations, abnormal HRT was a signiﬁcant and independent predictor of adverse events yielding a relative risk of 2.8–11.4 on univariate and 3.1–5.9 on multivariate analysis.
The single HRT studies substantially differ with respect to study design (retrospective vs. prospective), the primary endpoint investigated (total mortality, cardiac mortality, and sudden death), time of follow-up, time after MI when Holter recordings have been performed, mean LVEF, and treatment of MI.
Heart rate turbulence is generally a very strong predictor in all studies which used total mortality as primary endpoint (which most of the studies did: MPIP, EMIAT, CAST, ISAR-HRT, ISARRISK, ISAR-SWEET). HRT was also a very strong predictor in the ATRAMI study which used a combined endpoint of cardiac mortality and fatal and non-fatal cardiac arrest. Two studies investigated sudden death as primary endpoint, namely the FINGER study and the CARISMA study. While in the FINGER study mode of death was determined anamnestically or with the use of medical recordings, CARISMA had a unique study design: all patients of the CARISMA study underwent implantation of a loop recorder which allowed for a deﬁnite assessment of the rhythm at time of death. While HRT was a strong predictor of

sudden death in the FINGER study, predictive power of HRT in the CARISMA study was somewhat lower although still signiﬁcant [relative risk of abnormal TS 2.8 (95% CI 1.1–7.2), p = 0.038]. It should be noted, however, that in CARISMA only 25 endpoints occurred during a follow-up of 2 years and that only patients with reduced LVEF (≤40%) have been included. Therefore, conclusions drawn from the CARISMA should not be directly extrapolated to unselected post-infarction populations with no restriction of LVEF.
Time of HRT assessment after acute MI is an important issue. In most HRT studies Holter recordings have been performed early after MI (usually within the ﬁrst 4 weeks; MPIP, EMIAT, ATRAMI, FINGER, ISAR-HRT, ISAR-RISK, and ISARSWEET). In all of these studies, HRT was a strong and signiﬁcant predictor of the primary endpoint. However, also in CAST, where risk assessment was performed later after MI, HRT was a strong predictor of death (Hallstrom et al., 2005). In two studies, namely the REFINE and the CARISMA study, risk assessment has been performed at two different time points. In REFINE risk assessment has been performed between the 2nd and the 4th week as well as between the 10th and the 14th week after MI. In CARISMA, risk assessment has been performed during the ﬁrst week as well as during the sixth week after MI. In both studies, risk assessment later after MI was superior to risk assessment earlier after MI. It might therefore be concluded, that HRT assessed later after MI might be a better predictor than HRT assessed early after MI. These ﬁndings are in

agreement with the observation that autonomic dysfunction early after MI might recover, and that patients with sustained blunted autonomic function have the worst prognosis (Huikuri et al., 2010).
The single HRT studies cover the whole spectrum of MI treatment eras. In summary, neither acute treatment of MI (conservative, lysis, PCI) nor concomitant medical treatment including betablockers, ACE-inhibitors, or statins seem to affect risk predictive power of HRT. However, it should be noted that effective reperfusion strategies for acute MI which lead to increased myocardial salvage translate into improved autonomic function and better HRT (Bauer et al., 2009b).
Positive predictive accuracies and sensitivities of abnormal HRT for prediction of adverse events strongly depend on the populations and endpoints investigated. Generally, both positive predictive accuracy and sensitivity is in the range of that yielded by LVEF ≤30%. Figure 2 exemplarily shows risk stratiﬁcation by HRT in the largest post-infarction study, the ISARRISK study. Of the 2,343 patients studied, HRT category 2 identiﬁed a high risk group of 193 patients (8%) out of whom 56 patients died. 2,150 patients (92%) had normal (HRT category 0 and 1) out of whom 125 patients died. Probability of death within 5 years of follow-up of patients with abnormal HRT (HRT category 2) was 34%. In contrast, the 1,652 patients (71%) with completely normal HRT (HRT category 0) had a 5-year mortality of 6%. These ﬁgures translate into a positive predictive accuracy of 34% at a sensitivity level of 31%.

INDEPENDENCY FROM AND COMBINATION WITH OTHER RISK PREDICTORS In all studies, predictive value of HRT was independent from that of other risk predictors tested. These included demographic factors and comorbidities (age, gender, presence of diabetes mellitus, and renal insufﬁciency; Barthel et al., 2011), markers of electrical instability [arrhythmias, T-wave alternans (Exner et al., 2007), late potentials (Bauer et al., 2005), QRS duration (Bauer et al., 2006b)], markers of structural damage (e.g., LVEF), and other markers of autonomic dysfunction (heart rate, heart rate variability, and deceleration capacity; Bauer et al., 2006a, 2009a).
In order to enhance risk predictive power, HRT should be combined with other risk predictors. The ISAR-RISK and the ISAR-SWEET studies investigated the combination of abnormal HRT (HRT category 2) with mildly abnormal deceleration capacity (≤4.5 ms) which is a measure of tonic autonomic activity and bases on the processing of RR interval time series by a new mathematical algorithm (Bauer et al., 2006c). For this combination, the term “severe autonomic failure (SAF)” has been introduced. In both, ISAR-RISK and ISAR-SWEET which included 2,343 and 481 patients respectively, SAF proved to be the strongest predictor of death. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by the results of a recent metaanalysis which analyzed the combined populations of the MPIP, EMIAT, and MRFAT studies (n = 2,594; Bauer et al., 2009c). Also the combination of HRT with T-wave alternans is promising as both were independently associated with the primary endpoint in the REFINE study. However, available data do not allow for ﬁnal conclusions.
Risk stratiﬁcation by HRT is complementary to risk stratiﬁcation by LVEF. Only a small proportion of patients with abnormal HRT (category 2) also have LVEF ≤30%. Therefore, the strength of HRT lies in the identiﬁcation of high risk patients in the large group of patients with preserved LVEF (>30%). Figure 3 shows complimentary risk stratiﬁcation by HRT and LVEF in the ISARRISK study (Bauer et al., 2009a). The small proportion of patients with both, abnormal HRT and impaired LVEF (n = 40; 1.7% of the study population) had the worst prognosis. Patients with either abnormal HRT (n = 153; 6.5% of the study population) or impaired LVEF (n = 80; 3.4% of the study population) had equally poor prognosis. In contrast, patients with normal HRT (category 0 or 1) and LVEF >30% (n = 2,070; 88.3% of the study population) had an excellent prognosis. As mentioned above risk stratiﬁcation by HRT can be further improved by combination with deceleration capacity (Bauer et al., 2009a).

FIGURE 2 | Risk stratiﬁcation by heart rate turbulence in the ISAR-RISK study (Bauer et al., 2009a). The number of patients of the individual groups involved in the analyses at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years are shown under the graphs. The top and the bottom row corresponds to the upper and bottom Kaplan–Meier curve respectively. For all three comparisons (HRT category 0 vs. HRT category 1, HRT category 0 vs. HRT category 2, and HRT category 1 vs. HRT category 2) the p-value was <0.0001. (Adapted by permission from Bauer et al., 2009a).

LIMITATIONS OF HEART RATE TURBULENCE Several limitations need to be recognized when using HRT as riskpredictor. Firstly, assessment of HRT requires the presence of sinus rhythm. Patients with other rhythms than sinus rhythm such as atrial ﬁbrillation have been excluded in all HRT studies but might be at increased risk. In the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue plasminogen activator for Occluded coronary arteries (GUSTO-I) trial, 10.5% of the 41,021 patients had atrial ﬁbrillation during hospitalization (Crenshaw et al., 1997). Further, most HRT studies also excluded elderly patients (age >75 years or age >80 years). It is well known from the ATRAMI study that autonomic function loses some of its predictive value with increasing

age (La Rovere et al., 1998). Similar observations have been made for HRT in the ISAR-HRT study (Barthel et al., 2005). In contrast, HRT was a signiﬁcant predictor for sudden death in the population based Cardiovascular Health Study which included adults ≥65 years (average 73 years; Stein et al., 2010). Assessment of HRT also requires presence of VPCs. In most studies, patients without VPCs have therefore been excluded from the analysis (e.g., MPIP, EMIAT, ATRAMI). As shown in the ISAR-HRT study postinfarction patients without VPCs have equally good prognosis as patients with normal HRT (Barthel et al., 2003). Therefore, these patients might be treated as having normal HRT (HRT category 0). HRT is usually assessed from full 24-h Holter recordings. Whether HRT derived from shorter recordings provides similar predictive value needs further investigations. A retrospective analysis of HRT in the Multicenter Automatic Deﬁbrillator Implantation Trial 2 that used only 10-min recordings showed the inappropriateness of very short recordings (Berkowitsch et al., 2004). All post-infarction HRT studies included patients early after MI. A large-scale study which investigates the prognostic value of HRT in patients with remote infarction is still missing. This might be of substantial importance as prophylactic ICD implantation in the acute phase of infarction has been generally questioned by the negative results of two randomized ICD trials (Hohnloser et al., 2004; Steinbeck et al., 2009). It should be noted, however, that both studies, the

DINAMIT (n = 674) and the IRIS study (n = 898), used entry criteria that selected only a very small proportion of post-infarction patients at very high risk. For instance, the IRIS study selected 898 patients out of 62,944 patients (1.4%). Conclusions drawn from these two studies should therefore not be generalized and extrapolated to other risk stratiﬁcation strategies.
CONCLUSION Heart rate turbulence is easily applicable from routine 24-h Holter recordings. In all post-infarction studies HRT was a strong and independent predictor of adverse events which included death of any cause, cardiac death, and sudden death. In all post-infarction studies, predictive value of HRT was independent from other risk factors tested. For purpose of identifying high risk individuals who might beneﬁt from prophylactic ICD implantation, HRT should be combined with other independent predictors. Potential candidates include impaired LVEF, abnormal deceleration capacity, and/or T-wave alternans. The combination of abnormal HRT and abnormal deceleration capacity termed “SAF” has been tested in the ISAR-RISK study and provides strong prognostic value also in post-infarction patients with preserved LV-function. However, only future interventional trials can ﬁnally answer the question whether high risk patients identiﬁed by abnormal HRT beneﬁt from prophylactic therapy.

The time-domain measures and power–spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) are classic conventional methods to assess the complex regulatory system between autonomic nervous system and heart rate and are most widely used. There are abundant scientiﬁc data about the prognostic signiﬁcance of the conventional measurements of HRV in patients with various conditions, particularly with myocardial infarction. Some studies have suggested that some newer measures describing non-linear dynamics of heart rate, such as fractal measures, may reveal prognostic information beyond that obtained by the conventional measures of HRV. An ideal risk indicator could speciﬁcally predict sudden arrhythmic death as the implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD) therapy can prevent such events. There are numerically more sudden deaths among post-infarction patients with better preserved left ventricular function than in those with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Recent data support the concept that HRV measurements, when analyzed several weeks after acute myocardial infarction, predict life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with moderately depressed left ventricular function. However, well-designed prospective randomized studies are needed to evaluate whether the ICD therapy based on the assessment of HRV alone or with other risk indicators improves the patients’ prognosis. Several issues, such as the optimal target population, optimal timing of HRV measurements, optimal methods of HRV analysis, and optimal cutpoints for different HRV parameters, need clariﬁcation before the HRV analysis can be a widespread clinical tool in risk stratiﬁcation.

INTRODUCTION Heart rate variability (HRV) describes the complex regulatory system between heart rate and the autonomic nervous system. There are several methods to measure HRV (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). The traditional statistical methods and the power–spectral analysis of HRV are classic methods to measure HRV and are most widely used. The conventional measures of HRV have been shown to provide prognostic information in several patient populations (Kleiger et al., 1987; Bigger et al., 1992, 1993; Fei et al., 1996; Zuanetti et al., 1996; Nolan et al., 1998). The conventional measures of HRV cannot reveal delicate changes in heart rate beat-to-beat dynamics. Therefore several non-linear methods for measuring heart rate dynamics have been developed (Saul et al., 1987; Goldberger, 1990b, 1996; Skinner et al., 1993; Pincus and Goldberger, 1994; Peng et al., 1995; Voss et al., 1998; Tuzcu et al., 2006; Norris et al., 2008a). Few of these newer methods of HRV, such as the fractal-like scaling property and the complexity, have been tested in well-designed studies, which have included a relevant number of patients and have had well-deﬁned endpoints. Some of these studies have suggested that some of the non-linear measures of HRV work better than the traditional measures of HRV in predicting future adverse events in various patient groups. The physiological background of the nonlinear measures of HRV is much less well understood than that

of the conventional measures of HRV. The non-linear methods of HRV assess qualitative properties rather than the magnitude of the heart rate dynamics.
Several other factors than the type of the parameter inﬂuence the prognostic value of HRV measurements. The timing of the HRV measurement after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has a direct inﬂuence on the prognostic signiﬁcance of HRV due to substantial electrical and mechanical remodeling after AMI (Exner et al., 2007; Huikuri et al., 2009a). The prognostic value of HRV variables is also dependent on the left ventricular function and the severity of heart failure (Mäkikallio et al., 2001a, 2005). HRV parameters analyzed from short-term recordings obtained during controlled conditions yield somewhat different prognostic information than the HRV variables analyzed from long-term ambulatory 24-h recordings. It is also important to select appropriate preprocessing methods for editing premature depolarizations and irrelevant oscillations from RR interval time series in order to obtain reliable and reproducible prognostic data for clinical purposes (this is dealt in another review in the present issue). It is noteworthy that HRV parameters work prognostically differently in patients with different diseases and healthy subjects. The predictive power of HRV variables varies also depending on whether total mortality, different modes of mortality, or other adverse events are selected as endpoints. Several novel methods to describe heart rate dynamics, such as heart rate turbulence, have been developed

HRV in risk stratiﬁcation

(Schmidt et al., 1999). Their role in risk stratiﬁcation is discussed in other reviews in this issue as is the inﬂuence of exercise on heart rate dynamics.
During the past two decades the number of publications dealing with HRV has exploded reaching at least over 14,000 at the moment. The present review is focusing on some of these studies, of which the majority have relevant number of patients and welldeﬁned endpoints, and which elucidate the value of conventional and non-linear methods of HRV in risk assessment.
HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN RISK EVALUATION
CLASSIC STUDIES APPLYING CONVENTIONAL METHODS OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY ANALYSIS The prognostic signiﬁcance of the conventional measures of HRV in post-AMI patients is well established. Schneider and Costiloe (1965) ﬁrst proposed that HRV is reduced in patients with AMI and is associated with adverse prognosis. Wolf et al. (1978) found a signiﬁcantly lower in-hospital mortality rate among the patients with AMI, who had more pronounced sinus arrhythmia. Kleiger et al. (1987) published the cornerstone study, where they showed that decreased HRV measured by the SD of all normal-to-normal RR-intervals (SDNN) analyzed from 24-h electrocardiographic recordings predicts mortality in post-infarction patients. The combination of reduced HRV and the occurrence of late potentials was found to have a sensitivity of 58%, a positive predictive accuracy of 33%, and a relative risk of 18.5 for arrhythmic events in post-AMI patients (Farrell et al., 1991). In the study by Cripps et al. (1991), which included 177 patients after AMI, the relative risk of sudden death or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia during a median follow-up of 16 months was found to be seven times greater in those with low baseline values of the triangular index of HRV. In another study, after adjustment for relevant clinical risk markers, the total, ultralow-frequency and very-low-frequency powers of HRV remained a signiﬁcant and powerful predictor of mortality after AMI (Bigger et al., 1992). In 433 survivors of ﬁrst AMI, Odemuyiwa et al. (1994) observed that HRV was an independent predictor of sudden death and total cardiac mortality only during the ﬁrst 6 months of followup. The results of the study including 226 consecutive patients with AMI conﬁrmed the previous observations concerning the association between decreased HRV and mortality after AMI and suggested the importance of disturbance in sympathovagal regulation unrelated to left ventricular function or infarct location as a mechanism of high-risk (Vaishnav et al., 1994). Reduced HRV has been found to be related to both arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic death in post-AMI patients (Hartikainen et al., 1996). Fei et al. (1996) showed in their study including 700 consecutive patients after AMI that although the predictive accuracy of SDNN analyzed from 5-min short-term RR interval data for 1-year total cardiac mortality was lower than that of the HRV index analyzed from 24-h period, the SDNN short-term data could be used in preselection of high-risk patients. Bigger et al. (1993) studied the predictive value of the power–spectral measures of HRV obtained from short from 2 to 15 min electrocardiographic recordings in 715 post-AMI patients. They concluded that the power–spectral measures of HRV obtained from short recordings are remarkably similar to those obtained from 24-h recordings and predict

all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death. Zuanetti et al. (1996) evaluated the predictive value of several time-domain measures of HRV for total and cardiovascular mortality in 567 patients with AMI, who were treated with thrombolytic therapy and followed up for 1000 days. They concluded that time-domain indexes of HRV retain their independent prognostic signiﬁcance even in post-AMI patients of all ages treated with ﬁbrinolysis. Heart rate and HRV analyzed from predischarge 24-h electrocardiographic recordings were found to be more powerful predictors of mortality than ejection fraction in post-AMI patients in the study by Copie et al. (1996). Disturbed autonomic modulation of heart rate seems to be speciﬁcally related to susceptibility to ventricular ﬁbrillation, but not to stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, suggesting that autonomic inﬂuences modify the presentation of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia after previous myocardial infarction (Perkiömäki et al., 1997).
The analysis of HRV can give an insight into various pathophysiological processes including the progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis (Huikuri et al., 1999a) and the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease (Hayano et al., 1990). Patients with coronary artery disease may have decreased vagal activity (Airaksinen et al., 1987) and abnormal circadian rhythm of HRV (Huikuri et al., 1994). Furthermore, ischemia may be preceded by increased sympathetic tone (Bernardi et al., 1988).
It is noteworthy that the HRV counterparts of autonomic drives are very different in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects (van de Borne et al., 1997). However, there are a lot of publications, which show that HRV is decreased in patients with congestive heart failure (Saul et al., 1988; Casolo et al., 1989, 1991; Kienzle et al., 1992; Nolan et al., 1992; Mortara et al., 1994). Saul et al. (1988) observed decreased vagal, but relatively well preserved sympathetic modulation of heart rate in patients with chronic stable congestive heart failure. On the contrary, reduction of all spectral components of HRV were found in patients with congestive heart failure in the study by Casolo et al. (1991). Brouwer et al. (1996) observed in 95 patients with mild to moderate heart failure that abnormal Poincare plots were independent predictors of all-cause and sudden cardiac death.
Hypertensive patients have been found to have increased lowfrequency components and reduced high-frequency components of HRV (Guzetti et al., 1988). On the other hand, lower values of low- and high-frequency power of HRV were observed in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy than in controls, while ultralow- and very-low-frequency components were similar in the groups (Petretta et al., 1995). Left ventricular hypertrophy is a well known risk indicator, and HRV has been shown to be inversely related to left ventricular mass index (Mandawat et al., 1994, 1995; Petretta et al., 1995). However, not all studies have conﬁrmed this ﬁnding (Perkiömäki et al., 1996).
Disturbances in cardiac autonomic regulation assessed by HRV have been observed in several other conditions. Patients with diabetic neuropathy have decreased HRV (Wheeler and Watkins, 1973; Pfeifer et al., 1982; Smith, 1982). A reduced HRV in patients with diabetes still yields long-term prognostic information (Wheeler et al., 2002). In post-AMI patients the association between decreased HRV and long-term mortality has been observed to be at least as strong in diabetic patients as in

non-diabetic patients (Whang and Bigger, 2003). However, there are also some data to suggest that including patients with diabetes decreases the association between HRV and mortality after AMI (Stein et al., 2004). The measurement of HRV offers also prognostic information in an elderly population beyond that provided by the assessment of conventional risk factors (Tsuji et al., 1994). Patients with chronic renal failure (Axelrod et al., 1987; Cloarec-Blanchard et al., 1992) have decreased HRV. Patients with different neurological conditions, such as Parkinsonism (Kuroiwa et al., 1983), multiple sclerosis (Neubauer and Gundersen, 1978), and quadriplegia (Inoue et al., 1990), have also been observed to have reduced HRV. Decreased HRV has been found in heart transplant recipients, but allograft rejection may lead to increased HRV (Sands et al., 1989).
STUDIES APPLYING NON-LINEAR METHODS OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND NEWER STUDIES The fractal measures are the non-linear measures of HRV, whose prognostic signiﬁcance has most widely been assessed in clinical studies including relevant number of patients and using welldeﬁned endpoints. The fractal measures of HRV analysis have been shown to provide incremental prognostic information compared with the conventional measures of heart rate ﬂuctuations. A basic feature of a fractal system is scale-invariance, i.e., same features repeat themselves on different measurement scales (Goldberger, 1996). Healthy subjects´ erratic ﬂuctuations of sinus rhythm have fractal-like characteristics (Denton et al., 1990; Goldberger, 1990a).
Power-law HRV analysis is as a qualitative measure of the power spectrum in the region of the ultralow- and very-low-frequency bands obtained from long-term recordings. A plot of spectral power and frequency on bi-logarithmic scale shows linear portion between 10−4 and 10−2 Hz, and the slope of this relationship reﬂects long-term fractal-like scaling characteristics of HRV (Saul et al., 1987). Healthy subjects have power-law exponent values around −1 (Saul et al., 1987; Bigger et al., 1996), and the value of this slope has been observed to decrease with advancing age (Pikkujämsä et al., 1999). The ﬁnding that denervated hearts have a substantially steeper power-law slope emphasizes the important role of the autonomic nervous system in determining the steepness of the slope (Bigger et al., 1996). A steep power-law slope has been shown to be a better predictor of all-cause mortality or arrhythmic death than the traditional power–spectral bands in post-AMI patients (Bigger et al., 1996), and a better predictor of mortality than the traditional measurements of HRV in the elderly (Huikuri et al., 1998).
Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) quantiﬁes intrinsic fractal-like correlation properties of dynamic systems (Peng et al., 1994). Peng et al. (1995) have described the details of this method. Brieﬂy, the RR interval variability in relation to a local trend is analyzed in observation windows of different sizes in preprocessed and integrated RR interval time series. The RR interval variability is shown on a log–log scale as a function of the observation window size. In the presence of scaling, this relationship has a linear portion. The short-term scaling exponent (DFA1; for window sizes <11 beats) describes short-term scaling properties, and the intermediate-term scaling exponent (DFA2; for window sizes

>11 beats) longer term scaling properties of the signal. Healthy middle-aged subjects have the short-term scaling exponent values somewhat over or around 1 (Pikkujämsä et al., 2001). The values of the short-term scaling exponent are determined by a complex interplay of the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic nervous system. Concomitant activation of both vagal and sympathetic outﬂow has been shown to decrease the short-term fractal scaling exponent resulting in a random heart rate behavior (Tulppo et al., 2005). The physiological background of the short-term scaling exponent has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Huikuri et al., 2009b). Healthy elderly subjects may have changes in the fractal correlation properties of heart rate dynamics (Iyengar et al., 1996; Pikkujämsä et al., 1999), and the short-term scaling exponent has also been observed to predict cardiac death in the elderly (Mäkikallio et al., 2001b).
There is some evidence that the short-term fractal-like scaling properties of heart rate dynamics analyzed by the DFA technique can yield prognostic information beyond that obtained by the conventional measures of HRV. Studies in post-AMI patients have suggested that decreased short-term scaling exponent is a better predictor of mortality than the conventional measurements of HRV (Mäkikallio et al., 1999a; Huikuri et al., 2000) and that decreased short-term scaling exponent values are associated with vulnerability to ventricular tachycardia (Mäkikallio et al., 1997), ventricular ﬁbrillation (Mäkikallio et al., 1999b), arrhythmic death, and nonarrhythmic cardiac death (Huikuri et al., 2000). The prognostic value of the short-term scaling exponent has also been shown in a general post-AMI population without a marked left ventricular dysfunction and high proportion of patients on beta-blocking medication (Tapanainen et al., 2002). Fractal HRV has been observed to retain its prognostic value even when the vast majority of the patients were taking beta-blockers after AMI (Jokinen et al., 2003). Among the autonomic risk markers, the short-term scaling exponent has been found to be the strongest predictor of recurrent non-fatal coronary events after AMI (Perkiömäki et al., 2008). Disturbed cardiac autonomic regulation represented by reduced values of the short-term scaling exponent has been found to predict perpetuating ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but not selfterminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias in post-AMI patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction suggesting that perpetuating and self-terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias may have differences in factors, which modify arrhythmias (Perkiömäki et al., 2011; Figure 1). Figure 2 shows two typical cases of RR interval behavior in high-risk patients with low short-term fractal scaling exponent and one case with normal fractal scaling exponent.
Heart failure patients show loss of fractal organization in heart rate dynamics (Peng et al., 1995), and this is associated with the risk of death (Ho et al., 1997). Reduced short-term scaling exponent is more closely related to the risk of mortality in patients with less severe than in those with more advanced heart failure (Mäkikallio et al., 2001a). The short-term scaling exponent has also been shown to predict long-term risk for heart failure hospitalization after AMI (Perkiömäki et al., 2010).
The spontaneous onset of atrial ﬁbrillation in patients without a structural heart disease is preceded by altered short-term fractallike scaling properties of HRV (Vikman et al., 1999), and the shortterm scaling exponent changes toward more random direction in

Some of the non-linear measures of HRV, such as the short-term scaling exponent, have some advantages over the conventional measures of HRV considering risk stratiﬁcation purposes. These advantages include: less dependency on heart rate, less inter-individual and intra-individual variation (Perkiömäki et al., 2001c; Pikkujämsä et al., 2001; Maestri et al., 2007), smaller relative changes of individual values over time after AMI (Perkiömäki et al., 2001c), and relatively good comparability of individual values between long-term and short-term electrocardiographic recordings (Perkiömäki et al., 2001b).
The cardiac arrhythmias and risk stratiﬁcation after acute myocardial infarction (CARISMA) study included patients, who

had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% measured from 3 to 21 days after AMI. Several HRV measures, when analyzed from 24h ECGs recorded at 6 weeks after the AMI, predicted the primary endpoint of ventricular ﬁbrillation or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. However, the short-term scaling exponent was the only HRV measure, when analyzed from 24-h ECGs recorded at 1 week after the AMI, which signiﬁcantly predicted the primary endpoint. It is noteworthy that the arrhythmic endpoint events were objectively detected using implantable loop recorders in the CARISMA study (Huikuri et al., 2009a), whereas in most of the previous studies arrhythmic events/sudden arrhythmic cardiac death have been evaluated on clinical basis. In the recent non-invasive risk assessment early after a myocardial infarction (REFINE) study (Exner et al., 2007), which included post-AMI patients with somewhat better preserved left ventricular function than the CARISMA study, HRV measured from 10 to 14 weeks after the AMI tended to predict the primary endpoint of cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest, but had no association with the primary endpoint when measured from 2 to 4 weeks after the AMI. These notions underline the importance of timing for measurement of HRV after AMI.
The data on the prognostic signiﬁcance of the complexity measures of HRV are limited (Huikuri et al., 2009b). Decreased multiscale entropy of heart rate has been observed to predict mortality in trauma patients (Norris et al., 2008a,b). There has been shown to be association with reduced complexity in heart rate dynamics and postoperative complications after vascular surgery (Fleisher et al., 1993). Decreased complexity in heart rate behavior measured by approximate entropy has been found to precede spontaneous episodes of atrial ﬁbrillation in patients without structural heart disease (Vikman et al., 1999) and in patients after coronary artery bypass surgery (Hogue et al., 1998). Furthermore, the complexity of heart rate dynamics has been observed to reduce during 1 year follow-up after coronary artery bypass operation (Laitio et al., 2006).

HRV in risk stratiﬁcation

USEFULNESS OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN CLINICAL DECISION MAKING AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Despite a large body of evidence documenting the predictive value of various HRV indices, none of these methods are in widespread clinical use at the moment. If patients would be risk stratiﬁed to a therapy based on a HRV measurement, the therapy should improve the patients’ outcome. Therefore it should be evaluated in well-designed prospective randomized studies, whether the selection of the patients to the therapy based on potentially useful HRV measurements improves the prognosis. An ideal risk stratiﬁer should speciﬁcally predict sudden arrhythmic death as an implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD) therapy is effective in preventing such events. The patients with severely depressed left ventricular function are at highest risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (Huikuri et al., 2001), however, it has been found that HRV measurements work prognostically better in patients with more preserved left ventricular function (Mäkikallio et al., 2005) than in those with more severe left ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, there is evidence to support the concept that disturbed HRV predicts cardiac death in general and not speciﬁcally sudden arrhythmic death in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (Perkiömäki et al., 2001a; Zareba et al., 2003). On the other hand, there are numerically more sudden deaths among lower risk post-AMI patients with better preserved left ventricular function (Huikuri et al., 2001). Furthermore, as described above the results of the CARISMA study show that measures of HRV analyzed from electrocardiographic recordings obtained several weeks after AMI predict life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in post-AMI patients with moderately depressed left ventricular function (Huikuri et al., 2009a). Taken together, the post-AMI patients with moderate/mild left ventricular dysfunction would be the best target population for future prospective studies aiming to assess whether an intervention based on the assessment of HRV improves the outcome. In the CARISMA study, according to the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, e.g., the short-term scaling exponent analyzed from 24-h ECGs recorded at 6 weeks after the AMI had the area under the curve of order of 0.75 for predicting life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This can be considered potentially useful accuracy for risk stratiﬁcation purposes. However, the accuracy of this level does not simultaneously allow both an excellent speciﬁcity and sensitivity for any selected cutpoint. Therefore it would be important to try to ﬁnd additional

good risk markers, which could in combination with HRV measurements increase the accuracy in predicting sudden arrhythmic death. This is particularly important, if ICD therapy is considered based on this risk stratiﬁcation strategy as ICD implantation and therapy suffer from potential complications and discomfort and are relatively expensive. Severely depressed left ventricular function is considered to be a sufﬁcient risk indicator for prophylactic ICD implantation in post-AMI patients with acceptable numbers needed to treat values for getting a beneﬁt (Moss et al., 2002; Bardy et al., 2005). However, most of the post-AMI patients with better preserved left ventricular function at high-risk for sudden arrhythmic death do not get a primary prophylactic ICD therapy. Taken together, it would therefore be justiﬁed to consider to apply a cutpoint with compromised sensitivity of a HRV measurement to get high speciﬁcity, high positive predictive accuracy, and a low number needed to treat value in future prospective randomized prophylactic ICD studies in post-AMI patients with moderate/mild left ventricular dysfunction.
Despite many advancements, the analysis of HRV is still far from routine clinical use. Before it can be a useful tool for clinicians, at least the following questions need clariﬁcation: what would be the optimal timing for HRV analysis after AMI? What would be the optimal target population for the use of HRV analysis as a risk stratiﬁer? What method(s) should be used for HRV analysis in clinical settings? What would be the optimal preprocessing method for editing premature depolarizations for different HRV parameters in different clinical settings? What would be the recommendable cutpoints of selected HRV measurements for risk stratiﬁcation purposes in different cardiac conditions for different endpoints, in a same cardiac condition with different degree of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, and in different age and gender groups? What would be a recommendable length of ECG recording? Under what kind of conditions should the ECG recordings be done? What is the accuracy of selected HRV measures in predicting different adverse events in different cardiac conditions? What would be the expected beneﬁts of HRV analysis to patients’ further evaluation and treatment? What would be the number needed to treat value, e.g., to get beneﬁt from ICD therapy? Could the HRV analysis be used in the patients’ follow-up, etc.? Hopefully, after further developments and standardization the HRV analysis alone or with other risk indicators will soon serve as a useful tool for risk stratiﬁcation.

Many experimental and clinical studies have conﬁrmed a continuous cross-talk between both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of autonomic nervous system and inﬂammatory response, in different clinical scenarios. In cardiovascular diseases, inﬂammation has been proven to play a pivotal role in disease progression, pathogenesis and resolution. A few clinical studies have assessed the possible inter-relation between neuro-autonomic output, estimated with heart rate variability analysis, which is the variability of R-R in the electrocardiogram, and different inﬂammatory biomarkers, in patients suffering from stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Moreover, different indices derived from heart rate signals’ processing, have been proven to correlate strongly with severity of heart disease and predict ﬁnal outcome. In this review article we will summarize major ﬁndings from different investigators, evaluating neuro-immunological interactions through heart rate variability analysis, in different groups of cardiovascular patients. We suggest that markers originating from variability analysis of heart rate signals seem to be related to inﬂammatory biomarkers. However, a lot of open questions remain to be addressed, regarding the existence of a true association between heart rate variability and autonomic nervous system output or its adoption for risk stratiﬁcation and therapeutic monitoring at the bedside. Finally, potential therapeutic implications will be discussed, leading to autonomic balance restoration in relation with inﬂammatory control.

INTRODUCTION Systemic inﬂammation is a normal response to altered homeostasis and has an important role in several pathophysiological processes, such as infection or trauma. It is characterized by the endocrine release of different cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-4, IL-6,

IL-10, and many others, normally conﬁned to paracrine regulation of a local inﬂammatory response (Koj, 1997; Sporn, 1997). Apart from their involvement in local and systemic inﬂammation, cytokines may induce activation of brain-derived neuroendocrine immunomodulatory responses. Neuro-endocrine pathways, such as hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are powerful modulators of inﬂammation, typically through an anti-inﬂammatory balancing mechanism (Reichilin, 1993; Webster et al., 2002).
Recently, it has been demonstrated that subclinical inﬂammation and the con-centration of inﬂammatory markers, such as cytokines, correlate strongly to cardio-vascular mortality and morbidity in both healthy subjects and in those with known coronary artery disease (CAD) (Phillips et al., 1992; Ridker et al., 1997). Furthermore, vascular inﬂammation plays a critical role in the initiation, evolution, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque (Ross, 1993).
In the healthy state there is some degree of stochastic variability in physiologic variables, such as heart rate (heart rate variability). This variability is a measure of complexity that accompanies healthy systems and has been suggested to be responsible for their greater adaptability and functionality related

to pathologic systems (Buchman, 2002). Studying physiological signals of patients can easily identify ”hidden” information concerning inherent dynamics and overall variability within a time series. Recognition that physiologic time series contain such information deﬁes traditional mechanistic approaches based on conventional biostatistical methodologies and has fueled growing interest in applying techniques from statistical physics for the study of living organisms (Seely and Christou, 2000). Through those techniques different “physiomarkers” can be estimated that fulﬁll the requirements of contemporary medicine for better and more accurate early warning signs, since they are based on high-frequency measurements and are much easier to measure at the bedside (Seely and Christou, 2000). In this respect, a number of international databases and different processing methods of heart rate signals have been developed with free access from different investigators, such as the Web Site Physionet (www.physionet.org).
On the contrary, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that various “biomarkers” such as cytokines, exhibit marked interdependence, pleiotropy (multiple effects) and redundancy (multiple cytokines with the same effect) (Friedland et al., 1996). At the same time, their plasma concentrations ﬂuctuate from day to day and correlate poorly with classic physiologic variables in different groups of patients (Friedland et al., 1996; Seely and Christou, 2000; Buchman, 2002). Furthermore, biomarkers are difﬁcult to obtain routinely at the bedside. In addition, the ﬁnancial cost of various immunoassay techniques for their detection in blood samples tends to become an inhibiting factor for their extensive use, as diagnostic or even prognostic tools, in many Medical Centers.
NEURO-IMMUNOLOGICAL CROSS-TALK AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY ANALYSIS The pathophysiological link between the communication between the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the immuneregulated inﬂammation is the capability of the brain to monitor and to affect at the same time the immune status. The ﬁrst mechanism relies upon activation of vagus nerve afferent ﬁbers that signal the brain that inﬂammation is occurring. Different kind of mediators such as cytokines can activate visceral vagus afferent ﬁbers which terminate within the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the medulla oblongata. The DVC consists of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMN) and the area postrema (AP) (Berthhoud and Neuhuber, 2000). Ascending projections from the NTS reach hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which is associated with the synthesis and release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). This factor induces the production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, which is the main inducer of the synthesis of immuno-suppressive glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. Projections from NTS are connected to the DMN and to rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). This region increases ﬁring of the noradrenergic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord (Tracey, 2007).
The brain can affect the immunological status through the activation of the HPA axis and increased outﬂow of sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system. The SNS

activation during the early stages of stress induces local inﬂammatory response through α2–subtype adrenoreceptor stimulation by norepinephrine (NE), whereas stimulation of β2-subtype adrenoreceptor-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway is associated with an inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines’ production (van der Poll et al., 1996; Elenkov et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2001). It seems that SNS activation protects the organism from the detrimental effects of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, while it can increase local inﬂammatory response (Chrousos, 1995). In addition to the SNS, a link between the parasympathetic part of the ANS and immune-regulatory processes has been suggested (Tracey, 2002). It has been demonstrated that acetylcholine decreases TNF-α production by endotoxin-stimulated human macrophage cultures, through α7-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Wang et al., 2003; de Jonge et al., 2005). The vagus nerve cholinergic signaling interacts with the above receptor on immune cells in the spleen and inhibits TNFα production and release into the circulation (Huston et al., 2006). Acetylcholine is also effective in suppressing other proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein (Wang et al., 2004). This ”cholinergic anti-inﬂammatory pathway” is responsible for a ”hardwired” connection between the nervous and immune systems and is considered, as the primary component of the “immuno-reﬂex.” A more complete understanding of these reﬂexes can yield insight into both pathophysiological pathways and therapeutic strategies in many pathological processes, including infections, sepsis and cardiovascular diseases (Tracey, 2002, 2007).
In conclusion, there is strong evidence that CNS controls body’s systemic response to inﬂammation. Recently, different clinical studies investigating a possible association between ANS outﬂow and various inﬂammatory indices in patients with heart diseases have appeared in the literature (Aronson et al., 2001; Malave et al., 2003; Janszky et al., 2004; Shehab et al., 2004; Hamaad et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2006; Madsen et al., 2007; Nolan et al., 2007; Psychari et al., 2007; von Känel et al., 2011). The aim of these studies was to measure ANS activity through a set of different “physio-markers” and correlate them with various biomarkers that can indirectly assess inﬂammatory response in different clinical scenarios, such as CAD (Janszky et al., 2004; Hamaad et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2006; Madsen et al., 2007; Nolan et al., 2007; Psychari et al., 2007; von Känel et al., 2011) and heart failure (Aronson et al., 2001; Malave et al., 2003; Shehab et al., 2004). Moreover, the prognostic value of such measurements was tested in different groups of patients with cardiovascular diseases, in terms of mortality and risk of rehospitalization.
The best “physiomarkers” are obtained from analysis of heart rate variability (HRV); that is, the variability of R-R series in the electrocardiogram (ECG), and its frequency components (Lombardi et al., 1987; Task Force, 1996). Beat-to-beat ﬂuctuations reﬂect the dynamic response of the cardiovascular control systems to a host of naturally occurring physiological perturbations. A variety of animal and human research has established two clear frequency bands in heart rate signals. These bands include high frequency oscillations, between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz that are associated with respiration, and bands with a lower frequency range, below 0.15 Hz (Task Force, 1996). Akselroad et al. (1981)

Papaioannou et al.

Heart rate variability and cardiovascular inﬂammation

introduced power spectrum analysis of heart rate ﬂuctuations in order to quantify beat-to-beat cardiovascular control. Power spectrum density (PSD) analysis provides the basic information of how power (variance) distributes as a function of frequency (Akselroad et al., 1981; Malik and Camm, 1993). In 1996, the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the Northern American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology published guidelines regarding standardization of nomenclature, speciﬁcation of methods of measurement, deﬁnition of physiological and pathophysiological correlates, description of clinical applications and identiﬁcation of different areas for future research.
The association of higher risk of post-infarction mortality with reduced HRV was ﬁrst shown by Wolf et al. (1978). The clinical importance of HRV became appreciated in the late 1980s, when it was demonstrated that low HRV was a strong and independent predictor of mortality after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Kleiger et al., 1987; Lombardi et al., 1987).
MEASUREMENY OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY The RR variations may be evaluated by a number of methods:
TIME DOMAIN METHODS Time domain methods determine heart rate or RR intervals in continuous ECG records. Each QRS complex is detected and the normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (all intervals between adjacent QRS complexes) are calculated. Other time domain variables include the mean NN interval, the mean heart rate or the difference between the longest and the shortest NN interval, as well. The simplest of these metrics is the standard deviation of the NN intervals (SDNN), which is the square root of the variance. However, it should be emphasized that SDNN becomes less accurate with shorter monitoring periods. The most commonly used time domain methods are the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD), the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms (NN50) and the proportion derived from dividing NN50 by the total NN intervals (pNN50) (Akselroad et al., 1981; Task Force, 1996; Table 1).
FREQUENCY DOMAIN METHODS Spectral analysis of heart rate partitions HRV into its frequency components. Most commonly used methods are Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) and auto-regressive modeling. FFT displays in a plot the relative contribution (amplitude) of each frequency. This plot includes at least three peaks.Fast periodicities in

the range 0.15–0.4 Hz [high frequency (HF)] are largely due to the inﬂuence of the respiratory phase on vagal tone. Low-frequency periodicities (LF), in the region of 0.04–0.15 Hz, are produced by baroreﬂex feedback loops, affected by both sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of the heart, whereas very low frequency periodicities (VLF), in the frequency range between 0.003 and 0.04 Hz and ultra low frequencies (ULF, <0.003 Hz) have been variously ascribed to modulation by chemoreception, thermoregulation and the inﬂuence of vasomotor activity. The area under the power spectral curve (power) in a particular frequency band is considered to be a measure of HRV at that frequency, whereas the LF/HF ratio has been suggested as an indirect index of sympathovagal balance (Task Force, 1996). According to the report of the Task Force, the analyzed ECG signals must satisfy several technical requirements in order to obtain reliable information. The optimal sampling frequency range should be between 250 to 500 Hz. Ectopic beats, arrhythmic events, missing data and noise effects should be properly ﬁltered and omitted. Frequency domain methods must be preferred in cases of short term investigations. The recordings should last for at least 10 times the wavelength of the lower frequency bound, thus recordings of ∼1 min can assess the HF component of HRV while 2 min are needed for the LF component. In conclusion, 5-min recordings are preferred, unless the aim of the study dictates a different design (Akselroad et al., 1981; Lombardi et al., 1987; Task Force, 1996; Table 2).
ORIGIN OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY COMPONENTS
HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS
The cyclic variations in intrathoracic pressure perturbate venous return, cardiac out-put and thus, blood pressure. These changes are sensed by baroreceptors and result in changes in autonomic activity to the heart. These perturbations are mediated via the vagus nerve as atropine administration abolishes high frequency oscillations in heart rate (Akselroad et al., 1981). It seems that a major cause of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a central coupling of respiratory drive to cardiac vagal motor neurons. However, the changes in vagal activity are partly induced by baroreceptor sensing of respiratory oscillations in blood pressure and reﬂect all components of the baroreﬂex loop (DeBoer et al., 1987). In addition, factors such as reduced respiratory capacity and body position may alter the amplitude of high frequency oscillations in blood pressure and subsequently the HF component of heart rate signals (Malpas, 2002). Thus, heart rate variability analysis cannot be used for comparisons between different patient groups as there is a need for controlling ventilation for both rate and depth. Moreover, and since there is marked inter-individual variation in the relationship between HRV and parasympathetic effect, differences in HRV between individuals may reﬂect differences in this relationship, as was postulated by Goldberger (Goldberger et al., 2001). In this respect,

Heart rate variability and cardiovascular inﬂammation

this relationship in humans was described by a quadratic function in which there is an initial ascending limb, where HRV increases in parallel with vagal effect until it reaches a plateau level. Beyond this level, HRV decreases with further augmentation of vagal tone, probably due to a saturated HRV response upon intense autonomic stimulation (Goldberger et al., 2001). Finally, age and sex-related differences have also been associated with this variability (Goldberger et al., 2001).
LOW FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS The LF component of HRV is probably the most contentious aspect with respect to cardiovascular variability. There are two opposing theories in the literature proposing different potential origins: (1) the central oscillator theory (Montano et al., 1996) and (2) the baroreﬂex feedback loop theory (Lanfranchi and Somers, 2002). According to the ﬁrst theory, it is believed that LF oscillations reﬂect sympathetic tone and are generated by the brain stem circuits. In cats, Montano (Montano et al., 1996) analyzed the dis-charges of single sympathetic neurons located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla and caudal ventrolateral medulla. He observed activity at 0.12 Hz, which was positively correlated with heart rate and blood pressure variability. As the above oscillations remained after sino-aortic and vagal resection, it was assumed that the central nervous system is able to generate such oscillations.
According to the baroreﬂex feedback loop theory, a change in blood pressure is sensed by arterial baroreceptors, resulting in heart rate adjustment through the central nervous system and via both the fast vagal and the slower sympathetic actions (Lanfranchi and Somers, 2002). At the same time, baroreceptors induce a slow sympathetic withdrawal from the vessels. The delay in the sympathetic branch of the baroreﬂex in turn determines a new oscillation, which is sensed by the baroreﬂex and induces a new oscillation in heart rate. It has been also proposed that the LF oscillation arises from the interaction of slow sympathetic and fast vagal responses, where baroreﬂex buffering of the slow respiratory induced blood pressure oscillations results in resonant low frequency oscillations, due to the delay in the slow conducting sympathetic loop of the baroreﬂex (DeBoer et al., 1987).
In conclusion, it must be stressed that the low frequency oscillations of heart rate reﬂect the ability of the individual components of the baroreﬂex feedback loop to respond to different inputs that can alter the power of such oscillations and they are not just a measure of sympathetic nerve activity.
INTRACARDIAC ORIGIN OF HRV The reasons for reduced HRV during cardiovascular diseases have been debated and two theories have been developed. The ﬁrst theory focuses on reduction of vagal tone and has been introduced by Akselroad et al. (1981). The second theory developed by Goldberger and colleagues (2002) states that normal physiology has fractal-like properties with high levels of complexity that explain phenomena such as HRV. Its reduction during severe disease reﬂects a “de-complexiﬁcation,” mostly attributed to uncoupling between different restorative mechanisms (Godin and Buchman, 1996). In addition, accumulating evidence from both in vitro and ex vivo experiments support a potential third

mechanism (Grifﬁn et al., 2005), which is associated with an intracardiac origin of HRV. According to this hypothesis, sinus atrial node (SAN) cells can be viewed as an ampliﬁer of various input signals (Zaza and Lombardi, 2001). During cardiovascular diseases, an unfavorable metabolic milieu could affect ion channel gating properties or membrane receptor densities, with signiﬁcant impact upon level and variability of pacemaker activity. In addition, a possible reduced responsiveness of SAN cells to external stimuli could also negatively affect HRV (Zaza and Lombardi, 2001).
Moreover, different clinical studies in heart transplant recipients have found evidence for heart rate ﬂuctuations originating from the heart itself (Hrushesky et al., 1984; Bernardi et al., 1990). Bernardi studied intrinsic mechanism regulating HRV in both transplanted and intact heart during exercise (Bernardi et al., 1990). He found that at peak exercise a non-autonomic mechanism, probably intrinsic to the heart muscle, may determine heart rate ﬂuctuations in synchrony with ventilation, in transplanted as well as in intact hearts. Hrushesky and colleagues (1984) quantiﬁed respiratory sinus arrhythmia and found that individuals with a transplanted heart had resting RSA values similar to healthy subjects.
In conclusion, there is marked inter-individual variation between HRV response and different levels of autonomic stimulation. Basal autonomic activity, age and sex differences, alterations in expression of ion channel activity or autonomic receptors could be responsible for individualized curves, relating autonomic effects to HRV (Eckberg, 1997; Goldberger et al., 2001). In addition, LF/HF ratio has been criticized as an indirect measure of sympathovagal balance, reﬂecting rather autonomic ﬂuctuations and not absolute measures of autonomic nerve trafﬁc (Eckberg, 1997; Billman, 2013). Thus, interpretation of different studies investigating HRV alterations in different groups of patients should be cautious since variability in time of recordings and methods for HRV analysis, as well as heterogeneity of studying population, limit generalization of their ﬁndings.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERED HEART RATE VARIABILITY The ﬁrst large prospective population study that reported the signiﬁcant prognostic value of low HRV after an acute myocardial infarction was the Autonomic Tone and Reﬂexes After Myocardial Infarction Study (ATRAMI) (La Rovera et al., 1998), and included 1284 patients with a recent (<28 days) myocardial infarction. A 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify HRV (using SDNN values) and ventricular arrhythmias. Low values of HRV (SDNN < 70 ms) carried a signiﬁcant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality. Furthermore, the association of low SDNN with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35% carried a relative risk of 6.7, compared with patients with LVEF above 35%. Investigators from the Framingham Heart Study (Tsuji et al., 1994) computed HRV time and frequency domain measures in 736 patients and correlated them with all-cause mortality during 4 years of followup. They concluded that HRV offers prognostic information independent of that provided by traditional risk factors.

Heart rate variability and cardiovascular inﬂammation

were followed from 1960 until 1990, whereas SDNN was determined from the resting 12-lead ECG. It was shown that low HRV is predictive of mortality from all causes, indicating that it can be used as an index of compromised health in the general population. It seems that the predictive value of low HRV is independent of other factors, such as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of late potentials (Kleiger et al., 1987; Lombardi et al., 1987). In addition, retrospective ECG data analysis from 127 patients included in the Veterans Affairs’ Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) (Bilchick et al., 2002) demonstrated that CHF patients with SDNN <65.3 ms had a signiﬁcantly increased risk of sudden death. Moreover, this study demonstrated that every 10 ms increase in SDNN conferred a 20% decrease in risk of mortality.
HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES The relationship between HRV and inﬂammation has been studied mainly in patients with acute or stable CAD, CHF and metabolic syndrome with impaired glucose tolerance (Brunner et al., 2002). The inﬂammatory biomarkers that were used included C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, IL-6 and white blood cell count (WBC).
PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Hamaad et al. (2005) tested the association between time and frequency domain indices of HRV and circulating IL-6, high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and white cell counts, in a sample of 100 patients with proven acute coronary syndrome. In addition, they compared these metrics with healthy controls (n = 49) and estimated possible relationships on repeated measures at 4 months in recovery (n = 51). They found modest negative correlations between all inﬂammatory biomarkers and mainly SDNN, VLF and LF power. The strongest associations were seen between WBC and SDNN (r = −0.351). However, relationships did not persist on multivariate analyses after a 4-month period. According to the authors, the correlations were observed largely among HRV indices reﬂecting sympathetic activity, suggesting that the inﬂammatory response in acute coronary events may be associated with sympathetic activation instead of vagal withdrawal. Furthermore, leukocytosis observed in these patients seems to be a potential source of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines within the atheromatous plaque and might induce a potential rupture.
In another study, Lanza and colleagues (2006) assessed HRV and measured CRP serum levels within 24 h of admission in 531 patients with unstable angina pectoris. They found a signiﬁcant negative correlation between CRP levels and all HRV metrics derived from both time and frequency domain, with the highest correlation coefﬁcient with SDNN and VLF. After categorizing patients into 4 subgroups according to CRP quartile levels, signiﬁcantly lower HRV values were found in the upper CRP quartile. The subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that SDNN and VLF were the most signiﬁcant predictors of increasing CRP, whereas CRP was a strong predictor of impaired ANS activity as well.
In a study including patients with suspected CAD, Madsen et al. (2007) enrolled 269 subjects referred for elective coronary

angiography. They found that SDNN of heart rate signals was signiﬁcantly higher in the lower CRP quartile compared to the upper one, whereas associations were stronger for patients with a previous myocardial infarction and with signiﬁcant coronary stenoses.
In a similar study (Nolan et al., 2007), a negative correlation between CRP and HRV frequency components was reported, whereas a decreased HF power (reﬂecting vagal tone) in the high CRP quartile, compared to the lowest one, was found. In the study by Janszky and colleagues (2004) that included only female patients who survived hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and were evaluated 1 year after the event, levels of IL-6 showed an inverse relation with all HRV frequency measures, except for HF. However, this relationship, as well as the association between CRP levels and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) with HRV indices was non-signiﬁcant. Psychari et al. (2007) also reported a strong inverse association between CRP and several HRV indices (SDNN, HF, and LF) in post-MI patients and after adjustment for left ventricular function.
Recently, von Känel et al. (2011) investigated the association between HRV measured in the time domain, CRP, IL-6 and ﬁbrinogen, in a cohort of 862 subjects recruited from the Heart and Soul Study, which assessed health outcomes in 1.024 outpatients with stable CAD. They found that SDNN was inversely and signiﬁcantly associated with inﬂammatory indices, after adjustment of all covariates.
PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE
In 2001, Aronson et al. (2001) evaluated for the ﬁrst time the relationship between HRV metrics derived from both time and frequency domains and different biomarkers, such as IL-6, TNFα, and serum levels of norepinephrine, in 64 patients admitted for decompensated chronic heart failure. TNF-α levels did not correlate with any of the HRV indices. However, IL-6 was inversely correlated with SDNN (r = −0.36), with total power of heart rate signals and ULF (r = −0.37 and r = −0.43, respectively). No correlation was found between IL-6 and time (pNN50 and RMSSD) or frequency domain (HF power) indices of vagal activity.
Malave et al. (2003) examined HRV in relation to circulating levels of TNF-α, TNF-α receptors and norepinephrine in 10 controls, 15 patients with mild CHF and 14 subjects with moderate heart failure. There was a signiﬁcant inverse linear correlation between increased levels of all biomarkers and SDNN, LF and HF power among CHF patients. In addition, LF power was more closely correlated with circulating levels of TNF-α than was the HF component, whereas multiple linear regression analysis showed that TNF-α was a stronger predictor of reduced HRV than was the circulating levels of norepinephrine. The authors concluded that over-expression of TNF-α and subsequent loss of β-adrenergic responsiveness contributes to the decrease in HRV, observed in heart failure. According to ﬁndings from experimental studies (Chung et al., 1990), TNF-α might inhibit β-adrenergic signal transduction through either activation of Gi proteins or impairment of activation of Gs proteins, something that could be viewed as an adaptive mechanism in the early stages of CHF, protecting cardiac myocytes from the deleterious

actions of catecholamines. However, in the more advanced stages of the disease, this mechanism could become maladaptive, leading to a reduction in cardiac output (Mann et al., 1992).
Finally, in a small prospective study that included 34 patients with CHF followed for a 2-year period with monthly CRP measurements and 24-h Holter recordings, it was shown that ﬁve unexpected deaths that occurred were preceded by progressive increases in both CRP serum levels and autonomic dysfunction (low HRV indices) (Shehab et al., 2004).
HEALTHY CONTROLS As a part of the Copenhagen Holter study, that assessed the value of 24-h Holter recording in the risk assessment of men and women aged 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75 years with no apparent heart disease, Sajadieh et al. (2004) investigated the associations between time domain components of HRV, CRP and WBC in 643 healthy men and women. They found that SDNN was negatively correlated with smoking, inﬂammatory indices, blood sugar, triglyceride concentration, female gender and diabetes. Moreover, in multivariate regression analysis, increased heart rate and reduced HRV were signiﬁcantly related to white blood cell count and CRP. The reduction of SDNN was attributed to sympathetic predominance, whereas lack of any association between inﬂammation and pNN50, which is considered as a marker of vagal activity, indicates that reduced HRV is mainly due to increased sympathetic activity rather than vagal withdrawn.
From the Whitehall II cohort, a multicenter epidemiologic investigation of over 5000 subjects, two studies (Owen and Steptoe, 2003; Sloan et al., 2007) used sub-samples to examine the relation between HRV indices derived from the frequency domain and inﬂammation, in healthy subjects. In the ﬁrst study, Sloan found in a sample of 757 people, an inverse correlation between CRP and IL-6 with both LH and HF components of HRV power spectrum. In the second study, Owen and Steptoe did not ﬁnd any association between IL-6, TNF-α and time domain measures of HRV, in a group of 211 healthy adults.
Other investigators (Albert et al., 2002) reported a strong positive association between CRP levels and the long-term risk of sudden cardiac death, in case-control analysis among healthy individuals, followed for 17 years in the Physician’s Health Study. Men in the upper CRP quartile had a 2.8 fold increased risk of sudden cardiac death compared to men in the lower quartile. According to the authors, a low-grade inﬂammation involved in atherosclerosis shifts ANS balance toward sympathetic activation, making individuals more prone to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
The Twins Heart Study (THS) (Goldberg et al., 2002) was an investigation of psychological, biological and behavioral risk factors for subclinical cardiovascular diseases in 7.369 middle-aged male-male twin pairs, who served in the United States military during the Vietnam War. From this registry, a cohort of 264 twins free of symptomatic CAD was examined by Lampert et al. (2008), for assessing possible associations between HRV, CRP, and IL-6. They found an inverse relationship between frequency domain HRV metrics (except for HF) and both CRP and IL-6. These associations persisted after adjustment for other traditional CAD risk

factors, such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and depression.
A signiﬁcant confounding factor of HRV analysis that has to be considered in these studies includes the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. It has been estimated that ∼12–20% of hospitalized cardiac patients suffer from major depression, whereas 15% of subjects following acute myocardial infarction exhibit a posttraumatic stress disorder (Frasure and Lesperance, 2006; Garder and von Karel, 2006; Pizzi et al., 2008). In a 2-year follow up prospective observational study, Pizzi investigated the relation between time domain HRV indices, IL-6, TNF-α, CRP and depression in a cohort of 415 subjects free of CADs, with at least two CAD risk factors (age, male gender, current smoking, hypertension, dislipidaemia). All HRV and inﬂammatory indices were signiﬁcantly associated with depression. Logistic regression further showed that depressive individuals were more likely to have a higher CRP and IL-6 and altered HRV (lower SDNN).
In a recent study of Kop and colleagues (2010) who recruited 908 patients, free of CAD, for a median follow-up period of 13.3 years, it was demonstrated that among depressed participants, HF power of HRV was negatively correlated with CRP (r = −0.205), IL-6 (r = −0.233) and WBC (r = −0.292). Moreover, depression was associated with high IL-6 serum levels and increased cardiovascular mortality risk. In conclusion, in patients without heart disease depression seems to be associated with HRV imbalance and inﬂammation.
Table 3 summarizes the majority of clinical studies that have evaluated the relationship between different inﬂammatory biomarkers and HRV metrics, in patients with different cardiovascular diseases.
HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION IN CRITICAL ILLNESS The presence of sympathetic overactivity, autonomic dysfunction, inappropriately increased heart rate, insulin resistance and in some cases, cardiomyopathy with reduced cardiac contractility, has also been observed during severe sepsis and multiple organ failure (Muller-Werdan et al., 2006). However, in cardiac patients sympathetic activity dominates over vagal tone where in septic patients both branches of ANS are attenuated (MullerWerdan et al., 2006). For these reasons, it has been hypothesized that during critical illness except for ANS impairment, a defective signal transduction at the level of pacemaker cells could also account for observed differences between cardiac and septic patients (Fairchild et al., 2009).
Alterations in HRV during septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), have been reported from different research groups (Goldstein and Buchman, 1998; Goldstein et al., 1998; Seely and Christou, 2000). In this respect, Goldstein et al. (1998) found that both increased total variability and LF power were associated with recovery and survival, whereas a decrease in total power, LF/HF and LF power correlated with severity of illness and mortality in septic patients, 48 h after being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. In an animal study of experimental endotoxemia, induced by administration of lipopolysacchraride (LPS, endotoxin derived from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria) Fairchild and colleagues demonstrated a

strong inverse correlation between SDNN and total power of RR time series and peak concentrations of different cytokines, 3–9 h post-LPS (Fairchild et al., 2009). The same results were found after administration of recombinant TNF-α. It was suggested that mechanisms responsible for decrease in HRV could be related with effects of LPS and/or cytokines on various ion channels.
Tateishi et al. (2007) investigated the relationships between HRV and interleukin 6 upon admission in a cohort of 45 septic patients and they found that IL-6 exhibited signiﬁcant negative correlations with both LF and HF power values. These ﬁndings indicate a possible association between low HRV indices and hyper-cytokinemia.
In another study Papaioannou et al. (2009), we investigated possible associations between different HRV indices and various biomarkers of inﬂammation, in 45 septic patients and during the ﬁrst 6 days of their stay in the ICU. We daily assessed HRV in

time (SDNN) and frequency domain (LF, HF and LF/HF) and measured C-reactive protein, Interleukin 6 and 10 serum levels in two groups of patients. The ﬁrst group included subjects suffering from sepsis with mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of severity of illness (SOFA) ≤ 10 (n = 25) and the second group included patients with septic shock (SOFA > 10, n = 20). This study found in the group of patients with SOFA > 10, statistically signiﬁcant inverse correlations between CRP and LF/HF ratio (r = −0.61), (Figure 1A) and positive correlations with HF (r = 0.80). At the same time, IL-10 proved to be signiﬁcantly correlated with HF and SOFA score in a positive way and with LF, LF/HF and SDNN in a negative way. Finally, the total variability of heart rate signals (SDNN) was found to be negatively correlated with both CRP (r = −0.79) and SOFA score (r = −0.84) (Figure 1B). IL-6 was not signiﬁcantly correlated with any HRV parameter. It is possible that, the pleuripotency of this cytokine

points. According to the authors, vagus nerve innervation of the heart does not reﬂect outﬂow to other organs, such as the spleen, one of the major cytokine-producing organs (Tracey, 2002, 2007). As basal vagal input to the spleen may be different from vagal input to the heart, HRV might not be an appropriate method to assess activation of the cholinergic anti-inﬂammatory pathway (Kox et al., 2011). These ﬁndings strengthen the notion that autonomic outﬂow cannot be regarded as a general response, but appears to be organ-speciﬁc. In this respect, results from different studies discussed so far lack generalization and robustness due to different study populations and design, interspecies differences and potential impact of severity of disease, sedation or mechanical ventilation upon HRV (Goldstein and Buchman, 1998). However, it appears that an inverse association between inﬂammation and total variability of heart rate signals could be found in the most severe cases.

FIGURE 1 | (A) Longitudinal trends over time of mean values of CRP and LF/HF ratio, reﬂecting sympathovagal balance, for patients with SOFA > 10, during the 6 days of study period. [log transformed data, adapted from Papaioannou et al. (2009)]. It appears that LF/HF changes inversely with CRP. (B) Longitudinal trends over time of mean values of CRP and SDNN (secs), for patients with SOFA > 10, during the 6 days of study period. [log transformed data, adapted from Papaioannou et al. (2009)]. There is a progressive increase in SOFA score from day 1 until day 4 (development of septic shock) and a subsequent downward shift in its values. At the same time, the variability of heart rate signals estimated with SDNN seems to be signiﬁcantly reduced during the development of septic shock.
could be responsible for our results since IL-6 can behave as both a pro-inﬂammatory activator (induces the production of CRP) and inhibitor (limits Tumor necrosis factor α and IL-1β secretion), at the same time (Chrousos, 1995).
These ﬁndings suggest that reduction in HRV and LF/HF is related with an augmented pro- and anti-inﬂammatory response during sepsis, especially in more severely ill patients. Furthermore, severity of illness is positively associated with HF and IL-10 serum concentrations and changes inversely with variability of heart rate signals. In this respect, elevated levels of IL-10 have also been found in trauma patients who developed sepsis and multiorgan failure (Sherry et al., 1996).
In conclusion, it seems that critical illness and high cytokine levels are associated with reduced HRV, however, existing literature does not elucidate whether loss of HRV is related to an endotoxin effect at the level of ANS output, baroreﬂex sensitivity or the pacemaker cell itself. However, results from a prospective study in a group of 40 healthy adults who received a single intravenous bolus of 2 ng/kg LPS, suggested that there is no relationship between basal cardiac ANS activity, and the inﬂammatory response (Kox et al., 2011). Thus, no association was found between frequency components of HRV that were determined hourly and until 8 h after LPS administration and different pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, measured at various time

POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS
Different clinical trials have shown that fatty acids from ﬁsh oil can be considered as powerful disease-modifying nutrients in patients with acute lung injury, sepsis and cardiovascular diseases (Christensen et al., 1999; Abuissa et al., 2005; Pontes-Arruda et al., 2006; Singer et al., 2006). Particularly, feeding with the very-long chain, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docasahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been found to inhibit the activity of the pro-inﬂammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and subsequently, to attenuate the production of different cytokines, chemokines and other effectors of innate immune response (Singer et al., 2008). In the cardiovascular literature, it has been shown that oral supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs increase instantaneous HRV, reduce LF/HF ratio and confer protection against ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death (Abuissa et al., 2005). Moreover, Christensen (Christensen et al., 1999) demonstrated that ﬁsh oil feeding can induce an incorporation of DHA into the membranes of granulocytes, which is associated with a dose-response increase in HRV (SDNN), something that may protect against serious ventricular arrhythmias. Such effects of ﬁsh oil reﬂect an enhanced efferent vagal activity via a central-acting mechanism, due to a possible suppression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that have been found to inhibit central vagal neurons (Singer et al., 2008).
Never-the-less, different interventional studies on ω-3 PUFAs and HRV in patients with heart disease have found inconsistent results, with only 8 out of the 20 trials published so far, supporting a beneﬁcial effect on HRV (Christensen, 2011). Indeed, Mozaffarian et al. (2008) reported that individuals with the highest ﬁsh consumption (≥5 meals/week) only exhibited 1.5 ms greater HRV compared to those with the lowest ﬁsh consumption and further that this modest reduction in HRV was associated with only a 1.1% reduction in the relative risk for sudden cardiac death. Reasons for such inconsistency might include heterogeneous populations, limited sample sizes or different study protocols with variable administered doses of ω-3 PUFA and length of intervention. Furthermore, different methods of measurement of HRV with variable time of recordings could be an additional confounder. Finally, an animal study with administration of ω-3 PUFAs in rabbits showed that a reduction in pacemaker funny

current rather than an alteration in autonomic neural regulation was responsible for heart rate reduction and increase in HRV (Verkerk et al., 2009). However, such experiments were performed in denervated hearts, excluding a potential impact of autonomic tone on HRV. More recently, the HRV response to physiological challenges was not altered by dietary ω-3 fatty acids in conscious intact preparations; data that further suggest that these lipids elicited alterations in pacemaker rate rather than cardiac autonomic regulation (Billman and Harris, 2011; Billman, 2012).
Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have pleiotrophic mechanisms in patients with heart failure, such as ANS output modulation (Lefer, 2002). Experiments with animal models of heart failure have found decreased sympathetic activation and autonomic balance restoration with statins, using HRV analysis (Pliquett et al., 2002). In a crossover study of HRV in 30 patients with hyperlipidemia (Welzig et al., 2003), pravastatin administration induced a signiﬁcant increase in HF power of ECG signals, whereas others (Vrtovec et al., 2005) found that administration of 10 mg of atorvastatin for 3 months, was associated with signiﬁcant increase in SDNN and RMSSD, in 80 patients with CHF and hyperlipidemia. Moreover, cholesterol lowering was not correlated with HRV changes, suggesting another mechanism than that of lipidlowering of statins. In this context, Gao et al. (2005) showed that in experimental heart failure states there is intense free radical production and up-regulation of angiotensin receptors, in autonomic areas of the brain. Moreover, simvastatin therapy was proven to inhibit angiotensin II and superoxide pathways in the RVLM of pacing-induced heart failure rabbits, leading to an abolished renal sympathetic nerve activity (Gao et al., 2005).
Different experimental studies have shown that catecholamines, except from increasing cardiac contractility and heart rate via interaction with beta adreno-receptors, may induce myocardial damage by calcium overload and subsequent cell necrosis, upon excessive β-adrenoreceptor stimulation (Opie et al., 1985; Mann et al., 1992). Although, toxic cardiac effects of catecholamines have been recognized since 1907, Rona et al. (1959) was the ﬁrst who observed that isoproterenol injection into rats produced “infarct-like” myocardial necrosis, in the absence of coronary artery lesions. He proposed the theory of “relative hypoxia” as a pathophysiological mechanism, suggesting a possible imbalance between oxygen demand and blood ﬂow, after excessive adrenergic stimulation. Fleckenstein (1971) thought that calcium overload was the result of catecholamine-mediated cell injury, due to extensive activation of Ca-dependent ATPases and subsequent high energy phosphate deﬁciency, leading to mitochondrial impairment. On the contrary, Opie and co-workers (1985) were the ﬁrst who demonstrated that catecholamine cell injury was due to calcium overload, mediated by the β-adrenoreceptor. More recent studies have conﬁrmed previous results and have also demonstrated that other mechanisms could be responsible as well, for catecholamine-induced cell injury, such as increased ﬁbrosis of the left ventricle with associated hypertrophy (Briest et al., 2001) or myocardial cellular apoptosis (Commural et al., 1998).

Since heart failure is associated with a sympathetic upregulation and parasympathetic withdrawal, β blockers have been used to modify the effects of augmented sympathetic tone and restore autonomic imbalance. In this respect, Goldsmith et al. (1997) showed that administration of carvedilol for 4 months was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in HF power, in patients with CHF under digoxin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Similar results were found in post-MI subjects by Lampert et al. (2003), after treatment with propranolol for 6 weeks. An elevation in HF, which reﬂects restoration of sympatho-vagal balance, was found to increase ﬁnal outcome (LVEF, exercise capacity, death and CHF development) in both studies.
Recent evidence suggests that a primary site of attenuated vagal control on the heart occurs at the level of the parasympathetic gaglion (Bibevski and Dunlap, 2011). Thus, cervical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been recently assessed as an “add-on” therapy to optimal medical management of CHF. Li and colleagues (2004) were the ﬁrst who found that VNS performed for 10 s every minute, in rats developed HF after anterior myocardial infarction, improved signiﬁcantly left ventricular function and decreased mortality from 50 to 14%, in comparison with sham treated animals. Zhang et al. (2009) recently demonstrated in a canine model with high rate ventricular pacing induced HF, that VNS over 12 weeks was able to reduce left ventricular end systolic and end-diastolic volumes and increase LVEF signiﬁcantly. In addition, HRV was signiﬁcantly improved in VNS dogs whereas plasma norepinephrine and CRP levels were markedly attenuated with VNS treatment. Finally, vagal stimulation has also been found to limit infarct size and inﬂammatory response to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in male rats that underwent myocardial ischemia for 30 min and reperfusion for 24 h (Calvillo et al., 2011). According to the authors, the anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of the nicotinic pathway were the primary underlying mechanism in the VNS-treated animals.
Based on the results of VNS in animal models of HF, Schwartz et al. (2008) and De Ferrari et al. (2011) were the ﬁrst who assessed feasibility and safety and tested possible efﬁcacy of chronic VNS in HF patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV symptoms. In a two-staged study, (8-patients feasibility phase plus 24-patients safety and tolerability phase) they used CardioFit, a right cervical VNS implantable system delivering pulses synchronous with heart beats through a multiple contact bipolar cuff electrode. VNS was started 2–4 weeks after implant and patients were followed 1, 3, and 6 months thereafter. VNS was well tolerated whereas, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in NYHA class and left ventricular end-systolic volume. Moreover, a signiﬁcant increase in HRV, estimated with pNN50 and slightly but signiﬁcantly reduced heart rate were found 6 months after VNS onset (Schwartz et al., 2008; De Ferrari et al., 2011).
As a consequence of such preliminary results, a pivotal multicenter international clinical trial, the INOVATE-HF study, has been recently designed to assess safety and efﬁcacy of VNS in 650 CHF patients from 80 sites, with NYHA class III symptoms, sinus rhythm and QRS width less than 120 ms, using the CardioFit system (Hauptman et al., 2012). Thus, in case of

signiﬁcant decrease in mortality, vagal stimulation will add signiﬁcant value to current medical therapy in a narrow spectrum of patients with heart failure, through restoration of sympathovagal balance. Never-the-less, a lot of questions remain to be addressed, such as optimal stimulation mode (i.e., right vs. left vagus nerve stimulation, continuous vs. pulse-synchronous stimulation etc) or effective and tolerable VNS dose, before adopting this new non-pharmacologic treatment to our therapeutic armamentarium.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE SUGGESTIONS Different experimental studies have established an inter-relation between ANS output and inﬂammatory regulation, whereas the discovery of the “cholinergic anti-inﬂammatory pathway” has expanded our understanding of how the nervous system modulates the inﬂammatory response through an immunoreﬂex. Furthermore, clinical data from large epidemiological studies involving patients with CAD, heart failure and healthy subjects with increased risk factors for heart diseases suggest that there is a rather weak or moderate association between inﬂammation and ANS activity, estimated through HRV analysis. Finally, investigation of HRV alterations during critical illness, such as sepsis and MODS, has demonstrated loss of variability of heart rate signals that is inversely correlated with immune response, particularly in most severe cases.
Early and more accurate monitoring of cardiovascular patients, particularly in the early stages of life-threatening illnesses through continuous automated detection of abnormal variability of heart rate signals, could alert clinicians to impending clinical deterioration and allow earlier intervention. In this respect, the combination of structural indices, such as the left ventricular ejection fraction, with autonomic function indices derived from heart rate variability analysis has been proposed as the state-of-the-art method for risk assessment among patients with acute myocardial infarction or severe congestive heart failure (Priori et al., 2001). However, in-consistent ﬁndings from different studies assessing the relationship between HRV frequency components and inﬂammation limit adoption of HRV analysis as an indirect estimator of inﬂammatory response, since there is

a marked heterogeneity in study protocols, time and methods of HRV measurement and patients’ characteristics. Moreover, HRV analysis does not simply reﬂect sympathetic/parasympathetic balance, since HRV data can be inﬂuenced by artifacts related to differences in breathing characteristics, genetic factors or basal autonomic tone. Thus, any change in LF/HF ratio may correspond to central, baroreﬂex or cellular membrane effects of different stimuli during severe stress. Furthermore, sympathetic outﬂow can either induce or inhibit inﬂammatory activity, whereas HF component might fail to reﬂect vagal inputs upon different organs, such as the spleen, which are major cytokine producers. In addition, the explanatory power of HRV analysis is affected by circadian variability as well as by the estimation of inﬂammatory activity through biomarkers’ measurements from a single blood sample (Haensel et al., 2008). Finally, lack of signals’ stationarity (stable statistical properties) during measurements and the strong association between HRV data and inﬂammation that has been demonstrated among the most severely ill patients could reﬂect a non-linear relationship between ANS and inﬂammatory response. Thus, it has been suggested that newer methods derived from chaos theory should be implemented to assess ANS output, such as fractal and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) of heart rate signals (Goldberger, 1996). In addition, standardization of experimental protocols and methods used for the estimation of HRV is urgently needed, in order to allow comparisons among different studies.
In conclusion, the enormous complexity of neuroimmunological interactions cannot be captured by simple measurements, such as HRV analysis. A rather multi-parameter monitoring of ANS, through different estimators of heart rate variability and complexity has been suggested for assessment of ANS output (Goldberger, 1996). In any case and since HRV metrics are not enough for differentiating between pathophysiological states (poor speciﬁcity) or between patients (poor sensitivity), longitu-dinal alterations over time of both HRV and inﬂammatory markers on an intra-individual basis must be tested for establishing a potential added value of HRV analysis, as an indirect estimator of inﬂammatory response (Papaioannou et al., 2009).

Sleep is a physiological process involving different biological systems, from molecular to organ level; its integrity is essential for maintaining health and homeostasis in human beings. Although in the past sleep has been considered a state of quiet, experimental and clinical evidences suggest a noteworthy activation of different biological systems during sleep. A key role is played by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), whose modulation regulates cardiovascular functions during sleep onset and different sleep stages. Therefore, an interest on the evaluation of autonomic cardiovascular control in health and disease is growing by means of linear and non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) analyses. The application of classical tools for ANS analysis, such as HRV during physiological sleep, showed that the rapid eye movement (REM) stage is characterized by a likely sympathetic predominance associated with a vagal withdrawal, while the opposite trend is observed during non-REM sleep. More recently, the use of non-linear tools, such as entropy-derived indices, have provided new insight on the cardiac autonomic regulation, revealing for instance changes in the cardiovascular complexity during REM sleep, supporting the hypothesis of a reduced capability of the cardiovascular system to deal with stress challenges. Interestingly, different HRV tools have been applied to characterize autonomic cardiac control in different pathological conditions, from neurological sleep disorders to sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In summary, linear and non-linear analysis of HRV are reliable approaches to assess changes of autonomic cardiac modulation during sleep both in health and diseases. The use of these tools could provide important information of clinical and prognostic relevance.

“But what interests me here is the speciﬁc mystery of sleep partaken of or itself alone, the inevitable plunge risked each night by the naked man, solitary and unarmed, into an ocean where everything changes, the colors, the densities, and even the rhythm of breathing, and where we meet the dead. What reassures us about sleep is that we do come out of it, and come out of it unchanged, since some mysterious ban keeps us from bringing back with us in their true form even the remnants of our dreams”

INTRODUCTION The simple observation that human beings, mammals and other animal species spend about one third or more of their lifetime sleeping strongly suggest how fundamental the physiological process of sleeping is (Chou et al., 2003; Saper et al., 2005).
Despite the fact that a large amount of data has been published on the biological meaning and function of sleep, several key points still need to be clariﬁed.
The sleep process is characterized by the activation of a number of cortical, subcortical and medullar neural circuits, which cooperate in order to control sleep according to hormonal changes (i.e., melatonin and orexin), local factors such as adenosine accumulation, circadian variations (i.e., dark-light cycles) and other unknown factors (Saper et al., 2005). A key role in the physiology of sleep is played by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), whose regulation modulates cardiovascular functions during sleep onset and the transition to different sleep stages.
The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been widely used as a non-invasive and reliable tool to evaluate cardiovascular autonomic control in health and disease. The application

of different tools, such as linear and non-linear analysis of HRV during different sleep stages provided fundamental insight on the physiological autonomic changes that characterize wake-tosleep transition, sleep onset, and different sleep stages [rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep (NREM)]. In addition, different HRV tools revealed important modiﬁcations of autonomic cardiac control in different pathological conditions, such as insomnia, primary neurological sleep disorders, and sleep disordered breathing (SDB), a group of diseases associated with an alteration in the normal breathing during sleep (Parish and Somers, 2004; Nobili et al., 2011).
The present review will focus on the fundamental principles of sleep structure, the most used linear and non-linear analyses of HRV and the application of these tools to assess the autonomic cardiac control in normal and pathological sleep.
WAKEFULNESS-SLEEP TRANSITIONS Transition from wake to sleep is relatively rapid, considering that sleep onset is a process which lasts no more than one minute in human beings (Takahashi et al., 2010).
Interestingly, the switch from wake to sleep and among the different sleep stages is not monodirectional (i.e., from NREM, to REM), but, on the contrary, it oscillates from NREM to REM and vice versa, together with fast changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) cerebral waves and the occurrence of arousals (Saper et al., 2010).
The neural regulation of this process is very complex, counting several neural networks of neurons located both in the cortex and in the medulla. A key regulatory mechanism in the wake to sleep shift is the relation between hypothalamic and monoaminergic neurons. In fact, it has been shown that monoaminergic neurons in the pons project to noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and to dopaminergic and serotoninergic relay stations in the raphe (Saper et al., 2010). Wake period is characterized by ﬁring activity of these monoaminergic neurons, which inhibit ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and neurons which regulate the transition to REM sleep; this mechanism is capable of limiting a direct transition from wake to REM sleep. On the contrary, sleep is characterized by an increased activity of VLPO neurons, which, in turn, inhibits monoaminergic neurons, and, consequentially, triggers the sleep onset. This regulatory mechanism is only one of the most important neural network involved in the wakefulness—sleep switch, and it is called the ﬂip-ﬂop switch model (Saper et al., 2010).
The full description of the neural networks regulating the shift from NREM to REM sleep and vice versa is out of the scope of this review.

movements are absent while muscle tone is usually considerable. REM and NREM sleep are characterized by typical EEG features.
In fact, during wakefulness with closed eyes, on the EEG a typical rhythm, the alpha rhythm, becomes evident. Alpha rhythm is characterized by low voltage and high frequency waves, with a frequency band bounded between 8 and 12 Hz.
During doziness and sleep onset, cortical rhythm slows, alpha rhythm disappears and theta rhythm appears alongside the alpha; lower frequency (3.5–7.5 Hz) and higher voltage waves create theta rhythm; alpha disappears as sleep becomes deeper.
During N2, alpha rhythm completely disappears and theta rhythm is the dominant EEG oscillation. In addition, two peculiar EEG elements become evident at this time: spindles and K complexes. Spindles derive from bursts of brain activity and are characterized by high frequency waveform (12–14 Hz) lasting more than 0.5 s, while waves with a ﬁrst negative-high voltage peak followed by slow positive complex and a second negative peak are called K complexes. Their rate of occurrence is roughly every 1–2 min.
The transition from N2 to N3 is associated with the appearance of delta waves, which have high voltage (greater than 75 µV) and low frequency (bounded between 0.5 and 3 Hz). N3 is the sleep stage of highest synchronization of neural activity in the brain, with low muscle activity and no REMs. From N3 to REM, delta waves disappear and high frequency and low voltage waves become predominant; complete muscle atonia and REMs are observed.
HEART RATE VARIABILITY AS A WINDOW OVER AUTONOMIC CARDIOVASCULAR CONTROL The two branches of the ANS, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, regulate visceral functions in order to maintain the homeostatic milieu of the body and to render the body able to react and to adapt to external and internal stressor stimuli (Malliani et al., 1991; Montano et al., 2009) (see Figure 1).
A very composite and interconnected regulating mechanisms operate at different levels, both central and peripheral, in order to coordinate ANS functions (Montano et al., 2009).

SLEEP STRUCTURE
Sleep macrostructure is characterized by two separate physiological stages, REM sleep and NREM sleep.
REM sleep, identiﬁed in 1953, is a physiological state that includes REM and low muscle tone. On the opposite, NREM sleep is usually divided into two states, light sleep (NREM 1 and NREM2, or N1 and N2) and deep sleep (NREM3, or N3, also called Slow Wave Sleep, SWS); during NREM sleep rapid eyes

Heart rate variability and sleep

Within physiological conditions, the regulation of several fundamental visceral functions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems, is based on the reciprocal activation of the two autonomic subsystems, the so-called “sympatho-vagal balance”: the activation of one branch, i.e., sympathetic outﬂow, is associated with a withdrawal of the other, i.e., parasympathetic drive, and vice versa (Malliani et al., 1998). This mechanism has been considered a key stone paradigm of the ANS function for many years; however, it has been suggested that the coactivation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems is not only physiologically possible, but it is also a rule in peculiar situations such as chemoreceptor reﬂexes (i.e., during apneas), exercise, and cold face immersion (Koizumi et al., 1982; Malliani and Montano, 2002; Paton et al., 2005).
These brief observations suggest the high degree of complexity of the ANS regulation, mainly due to the strong interconnection with several biological systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, immunity, inﬂammation, metabolism, hormones etc.) and to its multifaceted mechanisms of action of sympathetic and parasympathetic limbs (i.e., as antagonists or agonists).
For many years, several techniques have been developed for the assessment of ANS: (a) dosage of plasmatic and urinary catecholamines (Goldstein et al., 1983), which is nowadays not considered as a highly reliable index of sympathetic activity (Esler, 1993; Montano et al., 2009), (b) muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), a direct but invasive recording of sympathetic activity using a microneurography technique (Wallin and Charkoudian, 2007), (c) analysis of HRV, a non-invasive tool able to provide reliable information on sympathetic and parasympathetic oscillations of the heart period and arterial pressure time series, (d) more recent non-linear approaches based on entropyderived measures and symbolic analysis of heart period time series (Porta et al., 2007a,b; Tobaldini et al., 2009).
LINEAR ANALYSIS OF HRV A pioneering study by Lee and Hon ﬁrst described signiﬁcant changes in beat-to-beat intervals during fetal distress before evident changes in heart rate (HR) (Lee and Hon, 1965). During the next years, several evidences supported the hypothesis that rhythmical oscillations of both HR and blood pressure (BP) are indirect measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation (Pagani et al., 1986; Malliani and Montano, 2002).
Therefore, HRV has been considered a non-invasive and reliable tool able to provide information on the sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation both in physiological and pathological conditions (Malliani et al., 1998; Montano et al., 2009). It is worth noting that HRV has been widely accepted not only as a tool to assess physiological autonomic functions, but also as a method able to provide important clinical information. Pioneering studies showed that, in post-myocardial infarction patients, total HRV was an independent predictor of mortality (Kleiger, 1987; Malik, 1989; Fei et al., 1996).
As stated above, HRV is based on the assessment of rhythmical oscillations embedded in heart period and blood pressure time series, which represent the sympathetic and parasympathetic modulations of cardiovascular function. Several computational methods have been validated, classically divided into non

parametric (based on a simple algorithm, usually a fast Fourier transform) and parametric tools, such as autoregressive algorithm, in which spectral components are identiﬁed independently of preselected frequencies (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
On the heart period and blood pressure time series, three main components can be recognized: a very low frequency component (VLF), frequency band below 0.04 Hz; a low frequency component (LF), bounded between 0.04–0.15 Hz, and a high frequency component (HF, bounded between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz), synchronous with respiration. The VLF component is considered to be a marker of humoral and hormonal ﬂuctuations; the LF component is discussed to represent a marker of both sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation while the HF component is considered a marker of vagal modulation.
In addition to the frequency band, each oscillation can be described in terms of amplitude, which can be expressed both in absolute (ms2 or mmHg2 for heart period and blood pressure time series, respectively) and in normalized units (nu). LFnu and HFnu represent the relative value of LF or HF with respect to the total variability, minus the VLF component (Malliani et al., 1991, 1998; Montano et al., 2009; Malliani and Montano, 2002).
It is worth noting that while HF oscillation is commonly accepted as a marker of parasympathetic modulation, the physiological meaning of the LF band is still debated. In fact, some authors have suggested that LF can be the result of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation (Berntson et al., 1997; Eckberg, 1997; Billman, 2011, 2013), while, on the contrary, other experimental and clinical data support the hypothesis that LF is a marker of sympathetic modulation (Malliani et al., 1991, 1998; Montano et al., 2009).
NON-LINEAR ANALYSIS OF HRV Classic power spectral analysis of HRV is based on the assumption that heart period time series contain only linear and stationary dynamics; however, in the last years, increasing interest has been paid to non-linear dynamics that characterize autonomic cardiovascular control (Goldberger et al., 1988; Kaplan et al., 1991; Voss et al., 1995). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that some non-linear parameters are better predictors of morbidity and mortality than standard linear spectral parameters in cardiac patients (Mäkikallio et al., 2001). Although several nonlinear methods have been developed, in the present review we will brieﬂy present entropy-derived measures, which have been recently applied for the assessment of autonomic cardiovascular complexity in physiological and pathological sleep.
Entropy-derived measures Physiologically, biological variables are controlled by the interaction of several systems, which actively interact with each other as agonists or antagonists at different time scales. In this perspective, beat-to-beat regulation is under the inﬂuence of sympatho-vagal balance, central oscillators, reﬂexes circuits such as baroreﬂex and chemoreﬂex control, sympatho-sympathetic reﬂexes, molecular, and hormonal regulation. All these mechanisms are responsible for HRV complexity (Goldberger et al., 1988; Kaplan et al., 1991).

Heart rate variability and sleep

During aging and pathological situations, one of these mechanisms may become predominant, with a decrease or an inhibition of the others, thus leading to a decrease of complexity of HRV and to a simpliﬁcation of cardiovascular regulation. If this is the case, plasticity of cardiovascular control is strongly impaired and the ability of the system to respond to internal and external stressor stimuli is signiﬁcantly damaged. Interestingly, some complexity indices are powerful predictors of mortality in highrisk patients (Voss et al., 1996; Huikuri et al., 2003; Clariá et al., 2008). Complexity is measured by evaluating the amount of information carried by a biological series, based on entropy-derived non-linear indices: the larger is the information, the greater is the complexity (Porta et al., 2001).
Entropy-derived indices, such as approximate entropy, sample entropy, corrected conditional entropy (CCE) and Shannon entropy (SE) have been proposed (Porta et al., 2001). Although a detailed description of the mathematical basis of these measures is beyond the scope of this review, we will brieﬂy describe the key aspects of SE, Conditional Entropy (CE), and CCE, which have been applied to provide information on cardiac complexity in normal and pathological sleep.
Shannon entropy (SE) SE evaluates the complexity of patterns distribution of length L, RRL = {RRL(i) = (RR(i), RR(i − 1), . . . , RR(i-L + 1)), i = 1, . . . , N-L + 1)}, by describing the shape of this distribution [SE(L) describes the shape of the distribution of RRL]. When SE(L) is calculated with L = 1, it depends on the shape of the distribution of the heart period time series. When SE(L) is large, the pattern distribution is ﬂat, meaning that all the patterns are equally distributed and the amount of information carried by the series is highest. On the opposite, when SE(L) is small, the pattern distribution is not ﬂat but characterized by speciﬁc shapes (i.e., Gaussian or skewed distribution), suggesting that some patterns are more present while others are less present or absent (Porta et al., 2001).
Conditional entropy (CE) and corrected conditional entropy (CCE) CE measures the quantity of information carried by the current RR sample when the previous samples are known. In other words, CE corresponds to the difﬁculty in predicting future values of RR intervals based on past values of the same series. CE is 0 when future values of RR are completely predictable given RR past values and it is equal to SE(1) when the knowledge of past values of RR is not helpful to reduce the uncertainty of future RR values. However, because the estimation of CE is biased (CE became unreliable as a function of L, decreasing very fast toward 0 with L independently of the ability of past values of RR to predict future RR samples), CCE was designed to overcome this mathematical limitation. CCE decreased to 0 when new sample is completely predictable, remained to the maximum value [i.e., SE(1)] when the new sample is fully unpredictable and showed a minimum when the knowledge of past values was helpful to reduce the uncertainty associated to future values (Porta et al., 2007a).
From CCE, it is possible to derive an index of regularity, Ro (obtained by dividing CCE by the Shannon entropy), which is

bounded between 1 (maximum regularity, lowest complexity) to 0 (lowest regularity, maximum complexity).
HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN WAKE/SLEEP STATES The interaction between ANS and sleep is complex, bidirectional and regulated by several different factors. In fact, changes in ANS regulation can profoundly affect sleep onset and sleep homeostasis and, on the opposite, modiﬁcations of physiological sleep can impinge upon autonomic cardiovascular regulation. It is well known that sleep is a complex phenomenon in which autonomic cardiac control ﬂuctuates between sympathetic and parasympathetic predominance, mainly according to the transition to different sleep stages (wakefulness, NREM and REM). Somers and colleagues showed that the cardiovascular system is strongly affected by the sleep stage: in fact, from N1 to N3, the stage of highest neural synchronization, a gradual decrease is observed in HR, BP and MSNA, with minimum values reached during N3, also called “quiet sleep” (Somers et al., 1993). REM sleep, however, is characterized by an opposite behavior, with a sort of “activation” of cardiovascular system to levels sometimes higher than wakefulness. Thus, the transition from NREM to REM is accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase of HR, BP, and MSNA, and, more interestingly, not stable but with continuous ﬂuctuations of the cardiovascular system, suggesting that cardiovascular control is very complex and inﬂuenced by several factors during this sleep stage.
Interestingly, animal studies showed that during REM sleep, sympathetic outﬂows from different sources (i.e., renal and lumbar sympathetic outﬂows) may change independently from each other, supporting the hypothesis that a differentiate control of sympathetic outﬂows could be important for arterial pressure regulation (Yoshimoto et al., 2011).
So far, several studies investigating the change of autonomic cardiovascular control by means of HRV during wake and different sleep stages provided fundamental information regarding the relation between autonomic ﬂuctuations and the shift to different sleep stages (Vanoli et al., 1995; Vaughn et al., 1995; Elsenbruch et al., 1999; Crasset et al., 2001; Trinder et al., 2001). According to the changes of HR, BP and MSNA, transition from wake to NREM sleep is associated with a gradual increase in parasympathetic modulation, expressed by an increased HF component and a decreased of LF component of HRV (Cajochen et al., 1994; Busek et al., 2005). Although the meaning of LF oscillation is someway still debated, the decrease of LF rhythm together with the changes in MSNA and BRS seem to suggest a global decrease of sympathetic modulation from wake to NREM sleep.
On the opposite, from NREM to REM sleep a signiﬁcant reduction in total HRV together with a shift of sympatho-vagal balance toward a vagal withdrawal and a possible sympathetic predominance has been reported (Berlad et al., 1993; Baharav et al., 1995; Versace et al., 2003).
Beyond these general considerations, it is worth noting that several factors can inﬂuence autonomic control during sleep stages, such as the stage preceding the change and the sleep cycle time point. In fact, it has been suggested that the degree of increased sympathetic modulation during REM sleep depends on the previous sleep stage, with signiﬁcantly higher values of LF/HF ratio during N2 preceding REM sleep compared to N2

preceding N3, supporting the hypothesis that autonomic control varies not only according to the sleep stage but also in relation to the preceding and following stages (Busek et al., 2005).
As to the sleep cycle, it has been reported that REM sleep at the end of the night is characterized by an increased sympathetic modulation compared to REM sleep that occurs during the ﬁrst part of the night. From a clinical point of view, this fact can be a potential link between increased sympathetic drive, REM sleep and the incidence of cardiovascular events in the early morning (Muller et al., 1995; Scholz et al., 1997; Verrier and Josephson, 2009).
The evaluation of spontaneous baroreﬂex sensitivity (BRS) revealed important information on the cardiac and vascular interaction through baroreﬂex circuit during sleep. In fact, it has been observed that during REM sleep, BRS is higher compared to nocturnal wakefulness (Monti et al., 2002). During the ﬁrst sleep cycle, BRS is higher during NREM compared to wakefulness and REM, while, during the last one, BRS is increased during REM compared to NREM, thus suggesting that the efﬁcacy of baroreﬂex control in blunting REM sympathetic drive is higher during the late sleep cycles (Legramante et al., 2003). Interestingly, this phenomenon is even more evident in hypertensive patients, in which the blunted BRS and the increase of sympathetic modulation are greater at the end of the night, possibly implicating the occurrence of cardiovascular events (Drager et al., 2009).
In addition to classic HRV analysis, the application of nonlinear entropy-derived measures revealed important changes of autonomic cardiovascular complexity peculiar for each sleep stage. However, due to the large amount of non-linear methods and experimental protocol differences, conclusive results are still lacking.
For instance, previous data showed that NREM sleep is characterized by an increased Sample Entropy while during REM sleep controversial results have been reported, from an increase of Approximate Entropy to a decrease of Sample Entropy (Virtanen et al., 2007; Vigo et al., 2010). A recent study by Viola and colleagues showed that CCE and SE were signiﬁcantly lower during REM sleep compared to wake and NREM sleep (Viola et al., 2011), and this reduction was more evident in aged people. These data suggested the hypothesis that in aged people, REM sleep more than NREM sleep could be considered a stage of reduced complexity of cardiovascular control, thus, a stage of potential increased cardiovascular risk (see Figure 2).
However, it is worth noting that NREM sleep is not a stable phenomenon; indeed it is punctuated by the occurrence of arousals, which represent transient episodes of cortical and autonomic activation. Moreover, besides the conventional arousals, characterized by fast EEG frequencies (within the alpha, 8–12 Hz, and beta, >16 Hz range), other EEG phasic patterns, such as K-complexes and bursts of slow waves are associated with an activation of vegetative and somatomotor functions (Ferini-Strambi et al., 2000; Ferri et al., 2000; De Carli et al., 2004; Halász et al., 2004). Therefore, both fast and slow EEG arousal components represent a certain degree of cerebral activation reverberating upon the ongoing autonomic activity (Terzano et al., 1985; Parrino et al., 2012). During NREM sleep, arousal ﬂuctuations appear with a pseudo-rhythmic modality, recurring about every

20–40 s. This arousal rhythm, deﬁned under the term of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) (Terzano et al., 1985, 1988), represents a condition of sustained arousal instability.
CAP alternates with phases of stable sleep (non-CAP, NCAP), characterized by rare and randomly distributed arousal-related phasic events. Different studies have shown that CAP and NCAP are accompanied by signiﬁcant changes of HRV parameters both in adults and children (Ferini-Strambi and Smirne, 1997; FeriniStrambi et al., 2000; Ferri et al., 2000). In particular, during a CAP phase an increase in LF and LF/HF ratio has been observed, suggesting that during arousal instability the sympatho-vagal balance is shifted toward a sympathetic predominance (Ferini-Strambi and Smirne, 1997; Ferri et al., 2000). Moreover, the CAP-related increase in sympathetic modulation was higher than the mean value expressed by the corresponding sleep stage as a whole (Ferri et al., 2000). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that BRS was higher during CAP than NCAP sleep, and it was similar during CAP and REM sleep (Iellamo et al., 2004). The analysis of the relationships between autonomic functions and CAP/NCAP phases could represent a more sensitive tool for the investigation of the effect of sleep disorders on HRV.
HRV AND SLEEP DISORDERS In the last decades, a growing interest has been focused on sleep disorders, mainly due to their epidemiological and clinical

relevance and to their possible association with cardiovascular diseases. The International Classiﬁcation of Sleep Disorders classiﬁed sleep disorders into several categories, such as (1) insomnias, (2) SDB, (3) hypersomnias, (4) parasomnias, and (5) sleep related movement disorders.
It is worth noting that most sleep disorders are characterized by important modiﬁcations of physiological sleep, and often by signs and symptoms of sleep loss, which have been demonstrated to be independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Wingard et al., 1982; Gallicchio and Kalesan, 2009; Cappuccio et al., 2010; Redline and Foody, 2011). It has been suggested that autonomic cardiovascular control could be importantly implicated as a potential physiopathological link between sleep disorders and their physiological consequences.
This section will brieﬂy explore HRV changes in three pathological conditions, i.e., SDB, Insomnia, and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy, which are characterized by noteworthy alterations of cardiovascular autonomic regulation and increased cardiovascular risk.
HRV IN SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING SDB is a group of diseases characterized by signiﬁcant alterations of breathing during sleep, which cause fragmentation of physiological sleep, symptoms of sleep deprivation and altered gas exchanges during the night. The most common SDB is Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which has a prevalence of 2–4% in middle age population.
OSA is associated with repetitive episodes of apneas during sleep, with partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during inspiration; thus, the increased resistance in the upper airways, caused by the collapse of the pharynx and hypopharynx muscles, lead to paradoxical thoracic and abdominal movements in order to overcome the airway obstruction. The frequent episodes of apneas have three main effects: hypoxia and hypercapnia due to gas exchange alterations, sleep fragmentation with repetitive arousal and, ﬁnally, irritability, daytime sleepiness and altered cognitive performance.
The clinical relevance of OSA is related to its strong association with obesity, hypertension, and increased cardiovascular risk (Kales et al., 1984; Bliwise et al., 1988; Hung et al., 1990; Somers et al., 1995; Narkiewicz and Somers, 2001). Although the pathophysiological factors linking OSA and cardiovascular risk are not completely understood, several evidences support the hypothesis that sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxia cause a chronic hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, a key component of the progression to cardiovascular disease. In addition, endothelial dysfunction and activation of inﬂammatory cascade have been described in OSA patients, possibly mediated by the activation of the SNS.
OSA must be suspected in patients with snoring, obesity, resistant hypertension and in patients with signs and/or symptoms of sleep loss (fatigue, hypersomnolence, daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairment etc.). The diagnosis of OSA is conﬁrmed in the presence of apneas (deﬁned as a stop in airﬂow of at least 10 s) and hypopneas (reduction of 50% of the ﬂow, with an oxygen desaturation of >4% and lasting at least 10 s). The number of apneic events is calculated as the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), i.e., the

total amount of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. An AHI lower than ﬁve identiﬁes a normal subjects, an AHI between 5 and 15 identiﬁes mild OSA, an AHI between 15 and 30 a moderate OSA and an AHI greater than 30 a severe OSA (Somers et al., 1995).
The repetitive episodes of apneas have important hemodynamic and cardiovascular consequences, which result evident both during nighttime and daytime. Subjects with OSA usually have higher resting HR and BP (Vanninen et al., 1996). The autonomic consequences of OSA mainly involve chemoreﬂex and baroreﬂex regulation, with a global shift of the sympathovagal balance toward a sympathetic predominance and a blunted parasympathetic control (Narkiewicz et al., 1998), evident either during wake, and during night. Namely, during apneic events, the physiological inhibition of sympathetic activity by lung inﬂation is lacking, causing a signiﬁcant sympathetic activation which is responsible for increased in BP and changes in HR. Sympathetic activity is highest at the end of an apnea, when hypoxia and hypercapnia reach their maximum levels; after the upper airways re-opening, it is possible to observe a large raise in blood pressure, which activates baroreﬂex control and induces a temporary withdrawal of sympathetic overactivity (Narkiewicz and Somers, 2001). The analysis of HRV revealed that during daytime, moderate to severe OSA patients were characterized by increased cardiac sympathetic modulation compared to mild-OSA and controls (Narkiewicz et al., 1998). Compared to controls, OSA subjects are characterized by a lower total variability and a possible shift of the sympatho-vagal balance toward a sympathetic predominance and a vagal withdrawal, as shown by the increase of LF component and LF/HF and the decrease of HF component (Narkiewicz and Somers, 2003; Smietanowski et al., 2006; Kesek et al., 2009) either during wakefulness and during nighttime (Shiomi et al., 1996; Vanninen et al., 1996).
It is important to underline a limitation of HRV application to sleep studies in OSA at this point. Indeed, the analysis of HRV during sleep is limited just by the presence of repetitive apneas, leg movements, or arousals, which artiﬁcially modify HRV analysis, introducing a “rhythmic” biological noise able to alter autonomic cardiovascular oscillations. This problem was highlighted by few studies that found that a higher AHI was associated with a higher vagal modulation during NREM sleep (da Silva et al., 2009) and, in contrast to the general expectations, in severe OSA patients, a decreased sympathetic regulation during REM sleep was observed (Gula et al., 2003). In fact, severe OSA induced an important modiﬁcation in breathing pattern, which could have per se been a relevant confounding factor able to impinge upon HRV rhythmical oscillations. For this reason, cardiovascular autonomic assessment in severe OSA patients can importantly be affected by non-neural oscillations related to the continuous episodes of apnea which could thereby alter HRV analysis (Wang et al., 2008); this factor must be taken into account when analyzing PSG data and interpreting the results. To this regard, in a recent paper assessing HRV during sleep in patients with Brugada syndrome diagnosed with or without SDB, ECG recordings derived from polysomnographic studies were analyzed, carefully avoiding periods with apneas/hypopneas and considering only ECG segments associated with stable and regular

breathing (Tobaldini et al., 2013). This approach allowed the observation that Brugada syndrome, a rare but life- threatening disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, more frequent during nighttime, was associated with an impaired autonomic cardiovascular control in the presence of comorbid SDB (Tobaldini et al., 2013).
The gold standard therapy for OSA is the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device able to maintain open the upper airways during sleep by inﬂating a positive pressure airﬂow, preventing the repetitive airway collapses as previously mentioned (Patel et al., 2003). CPAP therapy is able to improve cardiovascular outcome (Marin et al., 2005), with a signiﬁcant reduction of arterial pressure (Faccenda et al., 2001), inﬂammatory markers, insulin resistance (Brooks et al., 1994), and coagulation factors (Phillips et al., 2012). As to autonomic effects of CPAP, a pioneer study by Somers and colleagues showed that CPAP is able to acutely affect ANS, with a signiﬁcant decrease of MSNA during wake and sleep (Narkiewicz et al., 1999). Interestingly, even one night of CPAP treatment was able to affect HRV with a reduction of sympathetic modulation and an improvement of baroreﬂex control (Bonsignore et al., 2006; Kufoy et al., 2012). Longer CPAP treatments revealed positive effects on hemodynamic and metabolic variables, such as an improvement of arterial stiffness, a reduction of inﬂammatory response (Arias et al., 2008; Dorkova et al., 2008) and a decrease of platelet aggregation (Shimizu et al., 2002). However, the effects of longer CPAP treatments showed contrasting results and conclusive results on its consequences on HRV are still lacking. For instance, a reduction of the LF component and the LF/HF ratio, have been described, likely to be related to an improvement of chemoreﬂex and baroreﬂex responses (Roche et al., 1999; Khoo et al., 2001). Very recently, it has been described that long term CPAP (2 years treatment) is able to improve the coupling between parasympathetic modulation and delta wave sleep (Jurysta et al., 2013), suggesting a positive effect of this therapy on central and peripheral oscillations.
HRV IN INSOMNIA Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by an important inability to fall asleep, to stay asleep or to wake up too early, causing daytime sleepiness, fatigue, mood alterations, and memory impairment. Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders and it can be classiﬁed into (1) comorbid insomnia, i.e., associated with other diseases, either physical and mental, (2) primary insomnia (PI), i.e., unrelated to any other disease, and (3) chronic (or long-standing) insomnia.
Apart from the relevant effects on day-life activity, the importance of insomnia as a potential modiﬁable risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases has been recently underlined (Spiegelhalder et al., 2010; Redline and Foody, 2011).
The assessment of ANS control in insomniac patients revealed interesting results. A pioneer study by Bonnet and colleagues showed a signiﬁcant increase of the LF component and a decrease of the HF component of HRV in insomniacs compared to healthy subjects during sleep; these data suggested for the ﬁrst time that insomnia is characterized by a predominant sympathetic

modulation not only during wake but also across sleep stages (Bonnet and Arand, 1998).
These results have been conﬁrmed by successive studies, which showed that PI patients exhibit a constant sympathetic overactivity during night (de Zambotti et al., 2013) and a marked reduction of vagal modulation, indicated by the decrease of the HF component of HRV during the night (Spiegelhalder et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011).
These data support the hypothesis that in PI patients, sympatho-vagal balance is shifted toward a sympathetic predominance. Furthermore, the analysis of complexity indexes using entropy derived measures showed a considerable decrease in complexity during nighttime compared to healthy subjects, thus suggesting a possible link with cardiovascular diseases (Yang et al., 2011).
It is worth noting that PI patients do not only have an impaired autonomic cardiac modulation, but also an altered coupling between HRV and delta sleep. In fact, analyzing the relationship between the HF component and EEG delta power, PI patients showed a decreased HF-delta EEG coherence with respect to controls, thus suggesting a signiﬁcant change in the interaction between central and peripheral drives (Jurysta et al., 2009).
In summary, insomnia is a very common sleep disorder, relevant for its prevalence over general population and for its clinical consequences. An altered autonomic cardiovascular control has been described in insomniac patients, who show a shift of the sympatho-vagal balance toward a predominance of sympathetic modulation both during wake and night; this alteration could be responsible for increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.
HRV, SLEEP, AND SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH IN EPILEPSY (SUDEP) Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate seizures. Seizures are paroxysmal transient disturbances of brain functions that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena and psychic or sensory disturbances. Moreover, seizures can induce a perturbation of the ANS; indeed, neurovegetative symptoms such as cardiovascular and respiratory changes, gastro-intestinal, cutaneous, and genito-urinary manifestations, frequently occur during epileptic seizures (Baumgartner et al., 2001; Leutmezer et al., 2003). Finally, it has been shown that also sub-clinical epileptic discharges may be associated with autonomic instability (Brotherstone and McLellan, 2012).
In epileptic patients, especially in those with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, the risk of sudden unexpected death (SUDEP) is 24–40 times higher with respect to the general population (Ficker et al., 1998; Mohanraj et al., 2006). SUDEP is considered to be the result of a peri-ictal concurrence of a number of predisposing and precipitating factors (Nobili et al., 2011); nevertheless SUDEP is primarily a sleep related phenomenon and sleep related seizures seem to be an independent risk factor for SUDEP (Lamberts et al., 2012). Previous studies have shown decreased HRV in chronic epileptic patients suggesting that this might play a role in the pathophysiology of SUDEP (Tomson et al., 1998; Ansakorpi et al., 2000; Ronkainen et al., 2005). There are many reports suggesting that the autonomic changes observed in epileptic patients are mainly evident during nocturnal sleep. Indeed, patients (both
