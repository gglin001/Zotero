ABOUT SA-3000P
SA-3000P is an apparatus that analyze the “Heart Rate Variability” which give significant information on Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)’s regulating function and balance status. The change (variation) of heart rate during short term (5 minutes) is analyzed with the method of time domain and frequency domain to provide the degree of balance and activity of autonomic nervous system.
(For more details on SA-3000P, please read the operation manual of SA-3000P)

HRV, ITS BACKGROUND INFORMATION

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

HRV, ITS DEFINITION
HRV, heart rate variability is the degree of fluctuation in the length of the intervals between heart beats. (Malik & Camm, 1995) HRV is mirroring the regularity of hearth beats: bigger regularity - lowers HRV (and vices versa). Regularity of heartbeats is derived from a quantity of numbers; equal to the times elapsed between successive heartbeats. They are named R - R intervals and are measured in millisecond (ms). R-R intervals are obtained from ECG or plethysmogram.
6
[Figure 1] R-R interval
[Figure 2] R-R intervals and their fluctuations

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

GENERATION OF HRV
The intrinsic heart rate (HR) generated by the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the absence of any neural or hormonal influence is about 100 to 120 beats per minute (BPM). However in healthy individual resting HR would never be that high. In a health individual(adult), the HR is ranging between 60 and 90 beats per minute(BPM) and the HR estimated at any given time represents the net effect of the parasympathetic (vagus) nerves, which slow HR, and the sympathetic nerves, which accelerate it.
7
[Figure 3] Effect of ANS on intrinsic HR The heart response time to sympathetic stimulation is relatively slow. It takes about 5 seconds to increase HR after the actual onset of sympathetic stimulation and almost 30 seconds to reach its peak steady level. The heart response time to parasympathetic stimulation is almost instantaneous. Depending on the actual phase of heart cycle it takes just one or two heartbeats before the heart slows down to its minimum proportional to the level of stimulation.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

The physiological origins of HRV are the fluctuations of the activity of cardiovascular vasoconstrictory and vasodilatatory centers in brain. Normally these fluctuations are a result of blood pressure oscillation (baroreflex modulated); respiration; thermoregulation and circadian biorhythm. All these factors can influence the length of beat-to-beat intervals, named R-R intervals. The actual balance between their activities is constantly changing in attempt to achieve optimum considering all internal and external stimuli. At rest, both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are active with the vagal effects dominant.
8
[Figure 4] Generation of HRV This figure illustrates the relationships in block diagram form. The variability in HR is due to the synergistic action of the two branches of the autonomic nervous system which acts in balance through neural, mechanical, humoral and other cardiovascular parameters in their optimal ranges and to react optimally to changing external or internal conditions.

STRESS AND AUTOMNOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

When the body is challenged by almost anything that happens to us, from getting out of bed in the morning or running up a flight of stairs or having to stand up and give a talk, the brain activates the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the involuntary system of nerves which controls and stimulates the output of two hormones, cortisol from the adrenal cortex and adrenalin from the adrenal medulla. These two hormones and the activity of the ANS help us cope: the ANS and the adrenalin keep us alert by increasing our heart rate and blood pressure and quickly mobilizing energy reserves. In contrast, cortisol works more slowly, helps replenish energy supplies and, at the same time, helps us to remember important things. For example, cortisol readies our immune system to handle any threat -- bacterial/viral or injury.

Another aspect of cortisol action is called "containment." Many physiological systems

are pitted against one another so that neither system can get out of control. The initial,

first line response to many noxious or pathogenic agents is normally "contained" by

circulating levels of cortisol. This is why we take corticoids for an inflammation or skin

11

irritation. Cortisol also contains acquired immune responses, and this is particularly

useful when those responses are harmful, such as in an allergy or an autoimmune

disorder.

All of these adaptive responses are described by the term "allostasis" which means "maintaining stability, or homeostasis, through change." The body actively copes with a challenge by expending energy and attempting to put things right. Most of the time it succeeds but the real problems arise when….

(1) The systems involved in allostasis don't shut off when not needed or don't become active when they are needed.
(2) The balance between SNS and PNS can be disturbed and either one of the SNS or PNS can predominate over the other leading to stress related health problems.
(3) The body doesn't return to a state of rest after an emergency, or when the body's emergency response system is activated because the phone rings, or we look at our check book, or we have to wait in traffic.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

THE MEANING OF DEPRESSED HRV
12 [Figure 5] Meaning of depressed HRV Depressed HRV primarily means that heart rate is monotonously regular. And it means lowered ability of the ANS’s regulatory function and ability to keep the homeostasis, cope with the internal and external stressors (stress provoking agents) and resist disease or recover in proper time.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

METHODOLOGY AND TERMINOLOGY OF HRV ANALYSIS
13

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

METHODOGOLY

HRV can be assessed in two ways, either as a Time Domain Analysis or in the frequency domain as a Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis. In either method, the time intervals between each successive normal QRS complex are first determined. All abnormal beats not generated by sinus node depolarizations are eliminated from the HRV analysis.

Graph B is HRV tachogram which

every frequency wave from low to

high frequency mixed. After filtering

the high frequency power to

measure the power of sole low

frequency wave, only LF waves

remain like in Graph C and vise

versa (Graph D, remained HF wave).

14

The technique for this analysis is

called FFT.

[Figure 5] Power Spectral Density Analysis & Fast Furrier Transform (FFT)

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

Each of the methods has advantages and disadvantages. Time domain measures are the simplest to calculate but do not provide a means to quantify autonomic balance or information on the temporal distribution of power in the different branches of the autonomic nervous system. On the other hand, the main advantages of power spectral density(PSD) analysis over the time domain measures is that it supplies information on how the power is distributed (the variance) as a function of frequency, thereby providing a means to quantify autonomic balance at any given time.
15
[Figure 6] Time domain analysis and Frequency domain analysis

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

TERMINOLOGY

All HRV parameters are calculated on ‘normal-to-normal’ (NN) inter-beat intervals (or NN intervals) caused by normal heart contractions paced by sinus node depolarization.

Time Domain parameters Time domain measures are the simplest to calculate and include the mean normal-to-normal (NN) intervals during the entire recording and statistical measures of the variance between NN intervals. The most important time domain measures are the SDNN, SDNN Index and the RMSSD.

SDNN

SDNN is a standard deviation of the NN intervals, which is the square root of their

variance. A variance is mathematically equivalent to the total power of spectral analysis,

so it reflects all cyclic components `of the variability in recorded series of NN intervals.

The actual values of SDNN depend on the length of recording - the longer recording is,

the higher SDNN values are. Thus, in practice it is inappropriate to compare SDNN

values derived from the NN recording of different length. 24 hours’ SDNN reflects ebb

16

and flows of all factors that contribute to the heart rate variability during a 24-hour

recording, including the slow oscillations which are believed to reflect the heart’s

intrinsic ability to respond to hormonal influences. SDNN is measured in milliseconds.

SDNN Index SSSDNN Index is the mean of the standard of all the normal RR intervals of the standard deviations of all the normal RR intervals for each 5-minute segment of a 24hour ECG recording. The Index is believed to be a measure primarily of autonomic influence on heart rate variability.

RMS-SD - RMS-SD is the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals. This measure estimate high-frequency variations in heart rate in shortterm NN recordings that reflects an estimate of parasympathetic regulation of the heart. RMS-SD is measured in milliseconds.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

Frequency Domain Parameters

Total Power (TP) – Total Power is a short-term estimate of the total power of power spectral density in the range of frequencies between 0 and .4 Hz. This measure reflects overall autonomic activity where sympathetic activity is a primary contributor. Total Power is calcula-ted in milliseconds squared (ms2).

Very Low Frequency (VLF) - Very Low Frequency is a band of power spectrum range between 0.0033 and 0.04 Hz. Generally it is known this parameter indicates overall activity of various slow mechanisms of sympathetic function. Very Low Frequency band is calculated in milliseconds squared (ms2).

Low Frequency (LF) - Low Frequency is a band of power spectrum range between 0.04

and 0.15 Hz. This measure reflects both sympathetic and para-sympathetic activity.

Generally it is a strong indicator of sympathetic activity.

Parasympathetic influence is represented by LF when respiration rate is lower than 7

breaths per minute or during taking a deep breath. Thus, when subject is in the state of

relaxation with a slow and even breathing, the LF values can be very high indicating

17

increased parasympathetic activity rather than increase of sympathetic regulation. Low

Frequency band is calculated in milliseconds squared (ms2).

High Frequency (HF) - High Frequency is a band of power spectrum range between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz. This measure reflects parasympathetic (vagal) activity. HF is also known as a ‘respiratory’ band because it corresponds to the NN variations caused by respiration (this phenomena is known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)). Heart rate is increased during inhalation and dropped during exhalation. High Frequency band is calculated in milliseconds squared (ms2).

LF/HF Ratio - This is the ratio between the power of Low Frequency and High Frequency bands. This measure indicates overall balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Higher values reflect domination of the sympathetic system, while lower ones - domination of the parasympathetic system. This ratio can be used to help quantify the overall balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

Normalized Low Frequency (LF Norm) - Normalized Low Frequency is the ratio between absolute value of the Low Frequency and difference between Total Power and Very Low Frequency. This measure minimizes an effect of changes in Very Low Frequency power and emphasizes changes in sympathetic regulation. Normalized LF is calculated in percentile units. Normalized High Frequency (HF Norm) - Normalized High Frequency is the ratio between absolute value of the High Frequency and difference between Total Power and Very Low Frequency. This measure minimizes an effect of changes in Very Low Frequency power and emphasizes changes in parasympathetic regulation. Normalized HF is calculated in percentile units.

SDNN (MS) SDNN is the most representative parameter of HRV. Sometimes the term ‘HRV’ in medical papers indicates ‘SDNN’ among many parameters of HRV analysis. Thus low SDNN is low HRV, which primarily indicates reduction in dynamic complexity.
“Healthy individual has more irregular and complex HRV signal.” Decrease in HRV has received increasing attention as a prognostic indicator of risk associated with a variety of chronic diseases, behavioral disorders, mortality and aging.

RMS-SD (MS) This parameter is associated with the electrical stability of heart influenced by the PNS’s activity. Decrease in RMS-SD (RMS-SD: below 10) accompanying lowered SDNN (below 20) is related to high risk of cardiac disease development. For more detailed explanation, refer to terminology section.

PSI (NO SCALE) PSI means physical stress (physical pressure) index. PSI reflects the load and pressure to your heart based on SDNN and HRT at the same time. From the analysis of numerous 24h holter records, it is proven that HRT increases during exercising while HRV (SDNN) decreases, which is due to the increase in pressure to the regulation system.

APEN (NO SCALE)

Approximate entropy is a recently developed statistic quantifying regularity and

complexity that appears to have potential application to a wide variety of physiological

29

and clinical time-sereis data. The higher ApEn is the more tachogram is complex, which

is considered good.

SRD (NO SCALE) SRD indicates successive R-R interval difference. SRD is calculated by comparing the initial part (1/3) of total measuring duration to the successive part (2/3) of total measuring duration. The value 1(full scale) is the ideal state that means the measurement was done under constant status.

TSRD Total SRD is total successive RR interval difference during 5min measurement. It is used when the same patient exam more than twice in different condition of the same condition to compare the result influenced by the condition change or to confirm that the test condition was similar.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS (5 minutes)

TOTAL POWER (MS2)

0-0.4HZ

5 minute total power mainly reflects the level of the autonomic nervous activities (both

PNS & SNS) while 24h TP includes the humoral (hormonal) effects and circadian

rhythm as well as ANS’s activity. Generally decrease in TP is observed in individual

under chronic stress or with disease. The clinical meaning of TP in frequency domain is

similar with that of SNDD in time domain.

VLF (MS2)

0-0.04 HZ

In short term analysis, VLF doesn’t provide much meaning since this band often reflect

meaningless noise signals. But for your reference, the clinical meaning and

experiences of VLF are summarized below.

The VLF band provides an additional indicator of sympathetic function. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome have been shown to have an increase in the VLF band during the apnea, with the increases being synchronized with the episodes of respiratory arrest of hypoxemia. In other words, power in the VLF band increases when there is an absence of air exchange. It has been suggested that the VLF band originates from self-oscillations in the vasomotor part of the baroreflex loop and that the VLF augmentation during apnea is a direct result of sympathetic stimulation.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

Also, some observations of patients with fatigue of arrhythmias suggest that these individuals commonly have low VLF power and a low SDNN Index while their SDNN and ULF power is often relatively normal.

LF (MS2)

0.04-0.15HZ

The low frequency component can reflect both sympathetic and parasympathetic

activity. Parasympathetic influences are particularly present when respiration rates are

below 7 breaths per minute or when an individual takes a deep breath. So it’s important

to educate patient before the measurement not to intentionally control his breathing.

For more accurate analysis, natural breathing without any conscious respiratory

manipulation is highly required.

LF is highly associated with the SNS’s activity which enables the energy supply and

loss of energy can be predicted through lowered LF with fatigue.

Also in patients who display exaggerated sympathetic activity, as occurs in patients with

migraines, LF fluctuations are much stronger that in healthy subjects and can be

reduced by propranolol, clearly demonstrating the beta-sympathetic mediation in this

band.

31

HF (MS2)

0.15-0.4 HZ

This band reflects parasympathetic or vagal activity of ANS, which was confirmed after

a large number of studies showed that total vagal blockade essentially eliminates the

HF oscillations and reduces the power in the LF range.

Reduced PNS activity has been found in a number of cardiac pathologies due to the relationship with the electrical stability of the heart and in patients under stress or suffering from panic, anxiety or worry. Lowered PNS activity is also believed to account for much of the reduced HRV in aging.

And it is known that some people suffering from pain have an increase in the HF band at night above and beyond their normal increase at night when they are not in pain.

Generally increase in HF accompanies the increase in HRV.

SA-3000P Clinical Manual VER.3.0.

NORMALIZED LF & NORMALIZED HF HF norm= HF/(TP-VLF)*100= HF/(LF+HF)*100 LF norm= LF/(TP-VLF)*100= LF/(LF+HF)*100 This emphasizes the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the ANS. It is interesting to note that the ANS is able to maintain a close balance even during large changes in either sympathetic or parasympathetic activation.
LF/HF RATIO A higher number of LF/HF ration indicates increased sympathetic activity or reduced parasympathetic activity. At times, this ratio is used as a indicator of SNS activity.

In histogram, X-scale indicates RR-interval(ms) while Y scale

RRV indicates RR variation which reflects the variability of the heart rate. RRV looks like a "cloud" which consists of a number of points. It graphically displays current heart rate variability value versus the previous value. In other words, abscissa of the point is the length of the previous NN interval. The more variation that exist in the HRT, the wider the “cloud” (dotted shape) is displayed. If the heart rate were monotonously regular, the “cloud” would be the shape of a small and round ball with great density rather than long oval shape

The upper one is physical pressure index reflecting the SDNN and HRT in time domain. If the white bar goes to high side, it means the pressure to the heart gets higher. An individual with higher level of physical pressure is more likely to have psychosomatic disorder. The lower one is emotional status comes from the balance between SNS and PNS. Although the balance of them is not the sole factor associated with individual’s emotional status, this gives some useful clues. For instance, the feeling of anger or anxiety or anxiety moves the bar to ‘high (hyper arousal)’ side indicating SNS dominant to PNS while the feeling of appreciation moves the bar to ‘low (hypo arousal)’ side indicating PNS dominant to SNS.

Point>

If the LF/HF ratio is between 0.5-2.0, it is clinically considered as

balanced status.

Hyper SNS activity – Hypertonia – Related to anxiety, acute stress

response

Hyper PNS activity – Hypotonia – Related to depression,
