Abstract Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile (‘AC’) physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying (‘DC’) baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.

Topical Review

1. Background to the topical review

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical measurement technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue (Challoner 1979). It has widespread clinical application, with the technology utilized in commercially available medical devices, for example in pulse oximeters, vascular diagnostics and digital beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement systems. The basic form of PPG technology requires only a few opto-electronic components: a light source to illuminate the tissue (e.g. skin), and a photodetector to measure the small variations in light intensity associated with changes in perfusion in the catchment volume. PPG is most often employed non-invasively and operates at a red or a near infrared wavelength. The most recognized waveform feature is the peripheral pulse, and it is synchronized to each heartbeat. Despite its simplicity the origins of the different components of the PPG signal are still not fully understood. It is generally accepted, however, that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system (Kamal et al 1989).
This review has two parts. An introductory section describes the basic principle of PPG operation, light interaction with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The second section reviews current and potential clinical applications in physiological measurement under the categories of clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.

2. Photoplethysmography
2.1. The photoplethysmography waveform
The pulsatile component of the PPG waveform is often called the ‘AC’ component and usually has its fundamental frequency, typically around 1 Hz, depending on heart rate (ﬁgure 1). This AC component is superimposed onto a large quasi-DC component that relates to the tissues and to the average blood volume. This DC component varies slowly due to respiration, vasomotor activity and vasoconstrictor waves, Traube Hering Mayer (THM) waves and also thermoregulation (Burton 1939, Burton and Taylor 1940, Hertzman and Dillon 1940b, Hertzman and Roth 1942a, 1942b, 1942c, Hertzman and Flath 1963, Hyndman et al 1971, Pen˜a´z 1978, Ahmed et al 1982, Harness and Marjanovic 1989, Nitzan et al 1996b, 1996a, general thermoregulatory pulse changes in Shusterman et al (1997), Schultz-Ehrenburg and Blazek (2001), Nitzan et al (2001)). These characteristics are also body site dependent (Allen and Murray 2000b). With suitable electronic ﬁltering and ampliﬁcation both the AC and DC can be extracted for subsequent pulse wave analysis.

2.2. Optical considerations of the origins of the photoplethysmography waveform
The interaction of light with biological tissue is complex and includes the optical processes of (multiple) scattering, absorption, reﬂection, transmission and ﬂuorescence (Anderson and Parrish 1981). Several researchers have investigated the optical processes in relation to PPG measurements (Hertzman and Randall 1948, Brown et al 1965, D’Agrosa and Hertzman 1967, Weinman 1967, Zweiﬂer et al 1967, Challoner 1979, Ochoa and Ohara 1980, Nijboer et al 1981, Roberts 1982, Lindberg and O¨ berg 1993, de Trafford and Lafferty 1984, Kamal et al 1989). They have highlighted the key factors that can affect the amount of light received by the photodetector: the blood volume, blood vessel wall movement and the orientation of red blood cells (RBC). The orientation effect has been demonstrated by recording pulsatile waveforms from dental pulp and in a glass tube where volumetric changes should not be

possible, and more recently by Na¨slund et al (2006) who detected pulsatile waveforms in bone. The recorded pulses do bear a direct relationship with perfusion, and the greater the blood volume the more the light source is attenuated. However, attempts at pulse amplitude quantiﬁcation (‘calibration’) have been largely unsuccessful (Hertzman 1938, Challoner and Ramsay 1974, Jespersen and Pedersen 1986, Cejnar et al 1993).
The wavelength of optical radiation is also important in light–tissue interactions (Cui et al 1990), and for three main reasons: (1) The optical water window: the main constituent of tissue is water that absorbs light very strongly in the ultraviolet and the longer infrared wavelengths. The shorter wavelengths of light are also strongly absorbed by melanin. There is, however, a window in the absorption spectra of water that allows visible (red) and near infrared light to pass more easily, thereby facilitating the measurement of blood ﬂow or volume at these wavelengths. Thus, the red or near infrared wavelengths are often chosen for the PPG light source (Jones 1987), (2) Isobestic wavelength: signiﬁcant differences exist in absorption between oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) and reduced haemoglobin (Hb) except at the isobestic wavelengths (Gordy and Drabkin 1957). For measurements performed at an isobestic wavelength (i.e. close to 805 nm, for near infrared range) the signal should be largely unaffected by changes in blood oxygen saturation, and (3) Tissue penetration depth: the depth to which light penetrates the tissue for a given intensity of optical radiation depends on the operating wavelength (Murray and Marjanovic 1997). In PPG the catchment (study) volume, depending on the probe design, can be of the order of 1 cm3 for transmission mode systems. PPG can provide information about capillary nutritional blood ﬂow and the thermoregulatory blood ﬂow through arterio-venous anastomosis shunt vessels.
2.3. Early and recent history of photoplethysmography
This paragraph gives a brief summary of the early history of PPG and is taken from the excellent review article by Challoner (1979). In 1936 two research groups (Molitor and Kniazuk of the Merck Institute of Therapeutic Research, New Jersey, and Hanzlik et al of Stanford University School of Medicine) described similar instruments used to monitor the blood volume changes in the rabbit ear following venous occlusion and with administration of vasoactive drugs. Molitor and Kniazuk also described recordings made with a reﬂection mode PPG system from human ﬁngers. A pioneer who helped establish the PPG technique was Alrick Hertzman from the Department of Physiology at St. Louis University School of

Medicine, St. Louis, MO. In 1937, Hertzman and his colleagues published their ﬁrst paper on PPG describing the use of a reﬂection mode system to measure blood volume changes in the ﬁngers induced by the Valsalva manoeuvre, exercise and with exposure to cold. This excellent contribution to the ﬁeld demonstrated the potential clinical utility of the technique. In 1938, Hertzman undertook a validation of the PPG technique by comparing blood volume changes with those measured simultaneously by mechanical plethysmography. Preliminary observations on the PPG technique were also reported in the same year by Matthes and Hauss. Hertzman and Dillon (1940a) split the AC and DC components with separate electronic ampliﬁers and monitored vasomotor activity. Potential sources of error with the technique have been identiﬁed by Hertzman (1938), who emphasized that good contact with skin was needed, but without excessive pressure that would result in blanching. He advised that movement of the measurement probe against the skin should be avoided. These observations led to the development of elaborate positioning devices. Illumination was identiﬁed as another important design consideration. Hertzman also used a battery powered torch bulb which was less than ideal because of its relatively wide spectrum, particularly in the infrared because of local tissue heating, errors due to the effects of oxygen saturation, and the widespread illumination which can mix skin microvascular blood ﬂow with larger vessel signals. Furthermore, constant light intensity could not be guaranteed.
In more recent decades the desire for small, reliable, low-cost and simple-to-use noninvasive (cardiovascular) assessment techniques are key factors that have helped re-establish photoplethysmography. Advances in opto-electronics and clinical instrumentation have also signiﬁcantly contributed to its advancement. The developments in semiconductor technology, i.e. light emitting diodes (LED), photodiodes and phototransistors, have made considerable improvements in the size, sensitivity, reliability and reproducibility of PPG probe design. A major advance in the clinical use of a PPG-based technology came with the introduction of the pulse oximeter as a non-invasive method for monitoring patients’ arterial oxygen saturation (Aoyagi et al 1974, Yoshiya et al 1980). There have also been considerable developments in computer-based digital signal processing and pulse wave analysis.

2.4. Photoplethysmography instrumentation
Modern PPG sensors often utilize low cost semiconductor technology with LED and matched photodetector devices working at the red and/or near infrared wavelengths (CIE IR-A near infrared band 0.8 to 1 µm, Duck (1990)). An excellent review of optical sensor technology for PPG and pulse oximetry applications is written by Webster (1997).
The choice of light source is important (Burke and Whelan 1986, Lindberg and Oberg 1991, Ugnell and O¨ berg 1995). LEDs convert electrical energy into light energy and have a narrow single bandwidth (typically 50 nm). They are compact, have a very long operating life (>105 h), operate over a wide temperature range with small shifts in the peak-emitted wavelength, and are mechanically robust and reliable. The averaged intensity of the LED should be constant and preferably be sufﬁciently low to minimize excessive local tissue heating and also reduce the risk of a non-ionizing radiation hazard. The choice of photodetector is also important (Weinman and Fine 1972, Fine and Weinman 1973). Its spectral characteristics are chosen to match that of the light source. A photodetector converts light energy into an electrical current. They are compact, low-cost, sensitive, and have fast response times. Near infrared devices can be encased with daylight ﬁlters. The photodetector connects to low noise electronic circuitry that includes a transimpedance ampliﬁer and ﬁltering circuitry.
A high pass ﬁlter reduces the size of the dominant DC component and enables the pulsatile AC component to be boosted to a nominal 1 V peak-to-peak level. Carefully

chosen ﬁltering circuitry is also needed to remove the unwanted higher frequency noise such as electrical pick up from (50 Hz) mains electricity frequency interference. Figure 2(a) shows a transimpedance ampliﬁer design and ﬁgure 2(b) shows the signal conditioning stages surrounding this, including low pass ﬁltering, high pass ﬁltering and further ampliﬁcation, signal inversion and signal interface. The choice of high pass ﬁlter cut-off frequency is particularly important and is often a design compromise; excessive ﬁltering can distort the pulse shape but too little ﬁltering can result in the quasi-DC component dominating over the AC pulse (Allen and Murray 2003, 2004). This example system shows a constant current driver stage for the PPG probe LED.
There are two main PPG operational conﬁgurations: transmission (‘trans-illumination’) mode operation where the tissue sample (e.g. ﬁngertip) is placed between the source and detector, and reﬂection (‘adjacent’) mode operation where the LED and detector are placed side-by-side. Clearly, transmission mode PPG imposes more restrictions than the reﬂection mode PPG on the body locations available for study. The PPG probe should be held securely in place to minimize probe-tissue movement artefact. There are other sources of artefact that need to be considered in the measurement technology. For example, artefact can arise from ambient light interference but can be reduced in several ways: by suitable probe attachment to the skin (e.g. using a dark Velcro wrap-around cuff), by further shading of the study site area and performing measurements in subdued lighting, and by electronic ﬁltering (e.g. light modulation ﬁltering, Webster (1997)). Ambient light interference in PPG-based systems has also been discussed by Hanowell et al (1987).
Many of the studies reported in the PPG literature are for a single site, often the ear, ﬁnger or toe, where pulses can easily be detected (including Stern (1974), Barnes et al (1977a, 1977b), Sherebrin and Sherebrin (1990), Allen and Murray (1993), Chowienczyk et al (1999), Hahn et al (1999), Bortolotto et al (2000), Foo et al (2006), Millasseau et al (2006)).

artery, just above each eye has been studied (Lee et al 1981), as well as measurements on the skin above key arterial landmarks (Loukogeorgakis et al 2002). There have also been studies published which investigated PPG pulses at two sites simultaneously (Dillon and Hertzman 1941, Nijboer and Dorlas 1985, Cooke et al 1985, Grossmann et al 1987, Okada et al 1986, Porret et al 1995, Nitzan et al 1998b, 1998a, 2001). Three channel PPG research systems have been described by Evans and Geddes (1988) and four channel research systems by Buchs et al (2005) and Erts et al (2005). Multiple ﬁnger site pulse data have also been reported by Dyszkiewicz and Tendera (2006). Six channel PPG data have been published for simultaneous multi-bilateral site PPG data measurements (i.e. the right and left ear lobes, index ﬁngers or thumbs, and great toes) (Allen et al 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006). Technically, Allen and Murray (2000a) have emphasized the importance of the electronic and optical matching of pulse ampliﬁer channels to allow the best chance for right-to-left side physiological differences to be detected with conﬁdence. A multi-bilateral site PPG pulse measurement and analysis system and example pulse recording from a healthy subject are shown in ﬁgure 3. PPG systems are also available commercially. Examples include the Skidmore Medical Ltd. Vicorder, the Cuban Biof´ısica Me´dica ANGIODIN R PD 3000, and the VIASYS Healthcare MicroLiteTM and VasoGuardTM systems. These lists are not exhaustive.
Other emerging technologies include PPG imaging technology, telemedicine and remote monitoring. Schultz-Ehrenburg and Blazek (2001) and Huelsbusch and Blazek (2002) investigated an experimental cooled near infrared CCD PPG imaging system for studying skin blood ﬂow and related rhythmical phenomena. The aim of the technology was to obtain new insights into normal physiological tissue perfusion and detect changes associated with ulcer formation and wound healing. In 2005, Wieringa et al described a contactless multiple wavelength PPG imaging system whose main application is the remote imaging of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) distribution within tissue. The system acquires movies of twodimensional matrix spatially resolved PPG signals at three wavelengths (660 nm, 810 nm and 940 nm) during changes in respiration. A tissue oxygen image might be useful in many areas of medical diagnostics, for example in quantifying tissue viability. PPG has considerable potential for telemedicine including the remote/home health monitoring of patients. Miniaturization, ease-of-use and robustness are key design requirements for such systems. This is illustrated with ﬁnger ring-based PPG sensors for monitoring beat-to-beat pulsations (Rhee et al 2001, Zheng and Zhang 2003) and the need for motion artefact reduction, optimal sensor placement and minimizing battery power consumption. Innovative LED and photodetector array technology has been incorporated into a PPG ﬁnger sensor and palm-sized home health monitor to enable the pulse, oxygen saturation and respiration to be measured along with haematocrit derived from optical characteristics at ﬁve different wavelengths (569, 660, 805, 904 and 975 nm) (Yoon et al 2005). Preliminary clinical testing showed that the haematocrit was within ±10% of the gold standard value. Respiratory information was extracted using digital ﬁltering techniques and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) predicted using the standard ratio for the red and near infrared wavelengths.

2.5. Measurement protocol and reproducibility
Reproducibility is very important in clinical physiological measurement, for example in giving conﬁdence in detecting signiﬁcant responses to therapy. Many factors affect reproducibility, including the method of probe attachment to tissue, probe–tissue interface pressure, pulse ampliﬁer bandwidth, minimization of movement artefact, subject posture and relaxation, breathing, wakefulness, room temperature and acclimatization (Teng and Zhang 2006, Zhang and Zhang 2006). As yet, however, there are no internationally recognized standards for clinical PPG measurement. Published research tends to be based on studies using quite

There is similarity in the pulse characteristics between the right and left body sides but clear differences between the proximal and distal measurement sites. However, the degree of right to left side similarity in the high and low frequency components of the PPG waveform can be reduced in patients with vascular disease (Allen and Murray 2000a) and also in patients with autonomic dysfunction (Buchs et al 2005).

differing measurement technology and protocols, thereby limiting the ease with which PPG physiological measurements can be replicated between research centres.
There are a limited number of studies quantifying the repeatability or reproducibility of PPG measurements. An important study by Jago and Murray (1988) addressed the uncertainty in PPG measurements for a group of healthy adult subjects. They studied the repeatability of PPG pulse transit time (PTT) measurements made from the ear, thumb and toe sites both within session and between sessions held on separate days. Measurements at individual sites and bilateral (right–left) side differences were both assessed. The results showed the importance of controlling for factors such as posture, ambient temperature, relaxation and acclimatization. Bilateral measurements were generally more repeatable than individual site measurements since heart rate, respiration and blood pressure factors tend to affect both sides of the body simultaneously.
There have also been a limited number of studies published that quantify the complex physiological variability in PPG waveforms measured at different body sites. Applications that utilize the beat-to-beat variation in PPG characteristics include the assessment of autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular ageing (see section 3.3). It can also be useful, however, to obtain an averaged pulse measure to represent an individual subject/site. An averaging period covering at least 60 heartbeats has been suggested to improve conﬁdence in the single timing, amplitude or shape measurements extracted from the PPG pulse (Allen 2002).

2.6. Photoplethysmography pulse wave characterization and analysis
2.6.1. Pulse wave characterization. Two important characteristics of the PPG AC pulse waveform were described by Hertzman and Spealman (1937). The appearance of the pulse was deﬁned as two phases: the anacrotic phase being the rising edge of the pulse, and the catacrotic phase being the falling edge of the pulse. The ﬁrst phase is primarily concerned with systole, and the second phase with diastole and wave reﬂections from the periphery. A dicrotic notch is usually seen in catacrotic phase of subjects with healthy compliant arteries.
It is useful also to consider the blood pressure pulse and its propagation along individual arteries. The pressure pulse wave is known to change in shape as it moves toward the periphery and undergoes ampliﬁcation and alterations in its shape and temporal characteristics. These changes are thought to be largely due to reﬂection of the pulse wave and the tapering down of the arteries towards the periphery. Pulse propagation in arteries is further complicated by frequency dependent phase distortion. These phenomena have been described by O’Rourke and Gallagher (1996) and are discussed in the wider literature on pulse. The blood pressure pulse has similarities with the PPG blood volume pulse, with similar changes occurring in vascular disease, such as damping and a loss of pulsatility. The damping has been associated with a reduction in vessel compliance and increased peripheral resistance, although these changes have yet to be fully explained.
The potential of PPG for assessing vascular disease was recognized many decades ago. In 1940b, Hertzman and Dillon compared PPG to mechanical plethysmography in arteriopaths and in normal control subjects. They derived a crest time measurement from the rising edge of the pulse waveform and normalized this to the heart rate. The crest time was prolonged in patients with vascular disease or hypertension. The potential for extracting diagnostic information from the PPG pulse has been reviewed by Murray and Foster (1996). From the literature, many features have been investigated (ﬁgure 4), including beat-to-beat PPG rise time, PTT, amplitude, shape, and the variability in each of these. The pulse shape (contour) can also be described after normalization in pulse width and height (Allen and Murray 2003).

2.6.2. Pulse wave analysis. Manual measurement and feature extraction techniques were often used in the very early days of pulse wave analysis, using various media including chart recorder paper and ruler or photographic recording/magnetic tape (e.g. Hertzman and Spealman (1937), Dillon and Hertzman (1941), Simonson (1956), Corte (1979), Cooke et al (1985), Sherebrin and Sherebrin (1990)). Recent developments in computing technology and software data analysis tools have enabled the sophisticated pre- and post-processing of physiological waveforms. MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) is a digital signal processing environment that is well suited to pulse wave analysis algorithm prototyping, and often appears in the PPG literature.
It is well established that PPG measurements are quite sensitive to patient and/or probe– tissue movement artefact (see examples in ﬁgure 5). The automatic detection of such motion

artefact, and its separation from good quality although highly variable pulse recordings, is a non-trivial exercise in computer signal processing. Computer-based ﬁltering, feature extraction and waveform averaging have also been employed in PPG pulse wave analysis, including the analysis of frequency (de Trafford et al 1982, Okada et al 1986, Nitzan et al 1994, Bernardi et al 1996, Grohmann et al 1996a, 1996b, Larsen et al 1997, Sherebrin and Sherebrin 1990), joint-time frequency (Yan et al 2005), artiﬁcial neural network (Allen and Murray 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, Weng et al 1998), systems identiﬁcation and transfer function modelling (Cohn et al 1995, Allen and Murray 1993, 1995, 1996, McVeigh et al 1999, Millasseau et al 2000), principal component analysis (Enr´ıquez et al 2002), nonlinear and chaos theory (Christ et al 1997, Bhattacharya et al 2001), cross correlation (Allen and Murray 2000a, Drinnan et al 2001) and double differentiation (acceleration plethysmogram, Takada et al (1996–97), Takazawa et al (1998), Bortlotto et al (2000)).

3. Clinical applications
PPG has been applied in many different clinical settings, including clinical physiological monitoring (blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output and respiration), vascular assessment (arterial disease, arterial compliance and ageing, endothelial function, venous assessment, vasospastic conditions, e.g. Raynaud’s phenomenon, microvascular blood ﬂow and tissue viability) and autonomic function (vasomotor function and thermoregulation, blood pressure and heart rate variability, orthostatic intolerance, neurology and other cardiovascular variability assessments). This section reviews each of these areas with a view to demonstrating the widespread use of the optical technology in medicine and also its considerable potential for further innovation and application.

3.1. Clinical physiological monitoring
3.1.1. Blood oxygen saturation. Pulse oximetry is said to represent one of the most signiﬁcant technological advances in clinical patient monitoring over the last few decades (Webster 1997). It utilizes PPG measurements to obtain information about the arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) as well as heart rate (Aoyagi and Miyasaka 2002). It has widespread application in many different clinical settings, including hospital, outpatient, sports medicine, domiciliary use, and in veterinary clinics. In the early 1990s pulse oximetry became a mandated international standard for monitoring during anaesthesia. An excellent review of the technique can be found in Kyriacou (2006) where he described the basic principle of operation, measurement technology and its clinical applications. Earlier reviews of pulse oximetry have been written by Kelleher (1989) and Severinghaus and Kelleher (1992).
SpO2 can be determined by shining red and then near infrared light through vascular tissue, with rapid switching between the wavelengths. The amplitudes of the red and near infrared AC signals are sensitive to changes in SpO2 because of the differences in the light absorption of HbO2 and Hb at these two wavelengths. From their amplitude ratio, and corresponding PPG DC components, SpO2 can be estimated. This process usually involves an empirically derived calibration factor (Webster 1997). There is the assumption that the pulsatile component of the PPG signal results solely from the arterial blood volume changes with each heartbeat. Limitations of pulse oximetry are that the technique relies upon a peripheral pulse to be present, oxygen saturation readings can be affected by dyshaemoglobinaemias, and its accuracy can fall off at low saturation levels (Kyriacou 2006). Advanced computer algorithms have been developed to try to overcome the problem of movement artefact affecting the measurement

reliability. This includes the Masimo SET technology (Goldman et al 2000, Hayes and Smith 2001).
Pulse oximeters can measure SpO2 using both the reﬂection and transmission modes of operation (Mendelson and Ochs 1988). Central body measurement sites have also been investigated, including oesophageal oxygen saturation monitoring to overcome the problem of ﬁnger pulse loss associated with intra-operative peripheral cooling (Kyriacou et al 2002, Kyriacou 2006). Another recent and exciting development in pulse oximetry is the non-invasive measurement of venous oxygen saturation using external artiﬁcial perturbations applied close to the PPG probe (VENOX Technology, Chan et al (2003), Echiadis et al (2005)).

3.1.2. Heart rate. The heart rate is an important physiological parameter to measure for a wide range of clinical settings, including hospital-based and ambulatory patient monitoring. The AC component of the PPG pulse is synchronous with the beating heart and therefore can be a source of heart rate information. In pulse oximetry systems this information is often displayed alongside the SpO2 level. The main problem is that conﬁdence in the rate parameter can be reduced when there is signiﬁcant movement artefact or cardiac arrhythmia.
Computer algorithms have been investigated to improve the reliability of heart rate detection. These include simple digital ﬁltering and zero crossing detection to separate heart rate and respiratory components from the ear PPG signal (Nakajima et al 1996). Johansson et al (1999) have described a PPG-based device for heart rate (and respiration) monitoring in neonatal care units, and tested on PPG and ECG derived heart rate data acquired continuously over 8 hour sessions. High quality ECG recordings were obtained for 77% of the measurements. In these periods, excluding those disturbed by offset adjustment of the PPG signal (6%), the PPG heart rate included approximately 1% false negative and also 1% false positive beats. More sophisticated algorithms have been applied to extract heart rate information from PPG waveforms, including time-frequency techniques based on the smoothed Wigner Ville distribution (Yan et al 2005). The accuracy in measuring heart rate was evaluated by comparing pulses from the study hand at rest or undergoing controlled hand movements, with the pulses measured from the contralateral and stationary reference hand. The time-frequency approach showed signiﬁcant improvement over two traditional approaches (i.e. weighted moving average (WMA) and fast Fourier transform (FFT)) for measurements obtained during ﬁnger bend manoeuvres. The mean absolute pulse rate error reduced to 6 beats per minute (bpm) compared with 16 bpm for WMA and 11 bpm for FFT. In comparison with other heart rate measurement technologies good agreement by Bland and Altman analysis (Bland 1995) has been demonstrated between pulse oximetry and radial piezoelectric pulsations at the radial artery (Foo and Lim 2006c).
Automatic assessment of the reliability of reference heart rates from patient vital-signs monitors incorporating both ECG and PPG based pulse measurements has been proposed by Yu et al (2006). They expressed reliability as a quality index for each reference heart rate. The physiological waveforms were assessed using a support vector machine classiﬁer and the independent computation of heart rate made by an adaptive peak identiﬁcation technique that ﬁltered out motion-induced noise. The method was evaluated in 158 randomly selected 7 s data samples from trauma patients collected during helicopter transport. When the results of the algorithm were compared with the manual analysis performed by human experts at least 92% of cases could be matched. In the remaining 8% of cases the algorithm inferred a less conservative signal quality, as mainly attributed to ambiguously labelled waveform samples. If the ambiguous waveforms were re-labelled then the mis-classiﬁcation rate fell from 8% to 3%. Automatic heart rate detection systems for sleep studies have also been developed. Foo and Wilson (2006) utilized a dual measurement approach comprising an accelerometer

movement detector and a zero phase ﬁlter for enhancing the PPG signals in poor perfusion states. A decision matrix selected the appropriate technique to dynamically improve the PPG signal to noise ratio. The maximum error rate when compared to ECG heart rate measurement was less than 8%.

3.1.3. Blood pressure. Arterial blood pressure is also a very important clinical parameter to measure. Examples include the tracking of beat-to-beat blood pressure (or related surrogate pressure measurements) in autonomic function studies and also limb/digital blood pressure measurements in vascular disease studies. Several approaches to non-invasive PPG-based blood pressure measurements have been described in the literature and these are summarized below.
FinapresTM (for FINger Arterial PRESsure) technology was introduced in the early 1980s enabling the measurement of the arterial pressure waveform at the ﬁnger on a continuous beat-by-beat basis. The method is based on the dynamic (pulsatile) vascular unloading of the ﬁnger arterial walls using an inﬂatable ﬁnger cuff with built-in PPG sensor (Pen˜a´z 1973). A substantial number of comparative and methodological studies have been published on the technology, including a general review by Imholz et al (1998). Here, the main clinical applications for the technology focused on anaesthetic monitoring and autonomic function testing. The FinapresTM system is no longer commercially available, although alternative blood pressure devices have been introduced: the Portapres and Finometer systems (Finapres Medical Systems BV, Holland) and the Task Force Monitor system (CNSystems Medizintechnik, GmbH). A system overview of the Task Force Monitor is shown in ﬁgure 6 and illustrates how simple PPG-based technology can be incorporated into sophisticated clinical cardiovascular assessment tools.
Surrogate pulse measures of blood pressure have also been investigated, including tracking beat-to-beat changes in pressure using the PTT (Naschitz et al 2004, Payne et al 2006). PTT is usually calculated from the ECG R wave to the foot of the PPG pulse although sometimes the Q wave or a fraction of the pulse risetime is selected as the timing reference point. Chen et al (2000) described a method of combining high frequency information in the PTT and the lower frequency information in an intermittently acquired systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement. The predicted SBP changes were compared with measured pressure changes and the error remained within ±10% for 98% of measurements. Payne et al (2006), however, noted the signiﬁcant contribution of the cardiac pre-ejection period to PTT, potentially limiting its ability to track SBP in a clinical setting. To help limit the inﬂuence of pre-ejection, Foo et al (2006) has introduced the vascular transit time (VTT), deﬁned as the difference between phonocardiography heart sounds and the foot of the PPG waveform. In its validation, a series of arm raise manoeuvres on healthy subjects found an improvement in the correlation coefﬁcient (r) of transit time with SBP (r2 = 0.82). A recent innovation for the home monitoring of SBP is the prototyping of a toilet seat ﬁtted with PPG sensor and ECG electrodes (Kim et al 2006). Blood pressure was estimated using an algorithm based on the pulse arrival time and was compared with conventional arm blood pressure measurements. Their approach showed promise as a method for home monitoring of blood pressure.
Non-invasive blood pressure measurements are often used in the assessment of peripheral vascular disease, for calculation of the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) (Yao et al 1969). Limb pressures are traditionally measured using Doppler ultrasound, however, this is relatively expensive compared to PPG and requires an acoustic coupling gel. Upper and lower limb SBPs have also been measured using PPG and ankle/arm pressure cuffs (Nielsen et al 1973, McGuigan et al 2002, Laurent et al 2005, Jonsson et al 2005a, 2005b). In 2005b, Jonsson et al compared PPG and standard Doppler ultrasound measurements of ABPI and found no

signiﬁcant difference between techniques, with Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement (Bland 1995) of −0.19 to +0.16 for visual inspection of the pulse trace and −0.18 to +0.28 for automated pulse detection. An example of a commercial device for automatic PPG-based limb pressure measurement is the Vascular AssistTM vascular assessment system (Huntleigh Healthcare, UK).
Ankle cuff pressure measurements are not always possible because of arterial rigidity (‘calciﬁcation’), for example in patients with advance renal disease or diabetes mellitus. Toe blood pressures can be measured instead (Leskinen et al 2002). In the study by Hirai and Kawai (1977) a PPG probe was attached distally to an occluding pressure cuff, and found good agreement with strain gauge plethysmography and Doppler ultrasound techniques. Toe pressures have also been assessed using audio-photoplethysmography (Fronek et al 1994), where the pulse drives an audio oscillator enabling the operator to

audibly locate the point at which the pulse is restored following cuff release. PPG-based toe pressures have been used as a standard to validate new optical approaches to digital blood pressure measurement, including laser Doppler ﬂowmetry based methods (Ubbink 2004).
Nitzan et al (2005) have studied the effects of external pressure on arteries distal to the pressure cuff during sphygmomanometry. Bilateral PPG waveforms were measured on the ﬁngers of healthy male subjects during the slow release of cuff pressure. Signiﬁcant time delays were found between the pressure measurement arm and control arm, even at sub-diastolic pressures of 50 mmHg. Signiﬁcant bilateral differences in amplitude were also detected throughout the measurement cycle. These ﬁndings were attributed to changes in compliance of the conduit and small arteries with cuff inﬂation and deﬂation. Zheng et al (2005) have also investigated the relationship between external sub-systolic cuff pressures and PTT. Various proximal/distal arm pressure cuff conﬁgurations, including the equivalent of a whole arm cuff, were investigated across a range of study pressures (0–30 mmHg in 10 mmHg steps). The whole arm cuff produced the greatest mean increase in PTT (18 ms at 30 mmHg). The results agreed with theory; when the external cuff pressure increases for a constant arterial blood pressure, the arterial wall compliance increases which leads to an increase in PTT.

3.1.4. Cardiac output. For the resting healthy adult the volume of blood pumped by the
heart is in the region of 5 litres per minute but can be impaired in patients with cardiovascular
disease. Its accurate, reliable and non-invasive measurement is therefore very important
clinically. However, there is ongoing discussion in the literature in regard to the accuracy of
PPG-based cardiac output assessments (Azabji Kenfack et al 2004).
The stroke volume can be estimated from PPG-derived pulse contour analysis on a beatby-beat basis (where cardiac output = stroke volume multiplied by heart rate). Several methods have been explored, including the Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM, Romano and Pistolesi (2002)) and the ModelFlowTM method (TNO Biomedical Systems and
Finapres Medical Systems BV, Holland) (Harms et al 1999). PRAM has been compared
with gold standard direct-oxygen Fick and thermodilution methods (Romano and Pistolesi
2002) in order to validate the technique for non-invasive beat-to-beat monitoring of cardiac
output. The Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement (Bland 1995) across a range of cardiac outputs (range 2.3 to 7.4 l min−1) were ±0.9 l min−1 (Giomarelli et al 2004) and (range 1.8 to 10.4 l min−1) were ±0.6 l min−1 (Scolletta et al 2005), with no signiﬁcant mean differences between the techniques. The ModelFlowTM method of stroke volume estimation
utilizes a non-linear adaptive 3-element Windkessel model to mimic speciﬁc properties of the
aortic input impedance to estimate aortic blood ﬂow on a beat-by-beat basis. These elements
represent the characteristic impedance, Windkessel compliance and peripheral resistance. In comparison with thermodilution (ModelﬂowTM—thermodilution) the 95% limits of agreement across the range of cardiac outputs (6.4 ±1.1 l min−1) were −4.6 to +1.1 l min−1 with mean difference of −1.7 l min−1 (Remmen et al 2002). The exercise study by Tam et al (2004) introduced an independent calibration method (i.e. open-circuit acetylene uptake) and found that the 95% limits of agreement ranged from −6.6 to +7.1 l min−1 with elimination of bias offset. From these data they concluded that ModelﬂowTM was an accurate procedure for
measuring cardiac output in humans both at rest and during exercise, and could be used for
routine clinical purposes. In relation to cardiotherapy both Butter et al (2004) and Whinnett
et al (2006) have shown the potential beneﬁts of ﬁnger PPG for cardiac resynchronization
therapy to optimize cardiac output and function.

3.1.5. Respiration. Physiological monitoring of breathing interval (respiratory rate) is important in many clinical settings, including critical and neonatal care, sleep study assessment and anaesthetics. Respiration causes variation in the peripheral circulation, making it possible to monitor breathing using a PPG sensor attached to the skin. The low frequency respiratoryinduced intensity variations (RIIV) in the PPG signal are well documented (includes key workers, Johansson et al (1999) and Nilsson et al (2000)). It is considered that RIIV includes contributions from the venous return to the heart caused by alterations in intra-thoracic pressure and also changes in the sympathetic tone control of cutaneous blood vessels. The physiological mechanisms relating to the RIIV are, however, not fully understood.
In a study by Johansson and O¨ berg (1999a) the RIIV signal was digitally extracted from forearm PPG measurements and compared with simultaneous invasive venous blood pressure measurements and also the calibrated inspired volume respiration. The extraction algorithm was centred on a bandpass ﬁlter design (0.13–0.48 Hz, Bessel 16th order). A high correlation was obtained between waveforms for the normal volunteers studied, although an absolute measurement of the respiratory volume from RIIV was not possible. Johansson and O¨ berg (1999b) then modelled the dynamics of the system using a Windkessel and compartmental modelling approach. Coherence has also been shown between forearm RIIV waveforms and changes in central and peripheral venous pressures, arterial pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate by Nilsson et al (2003a, 2003b, 2005), for spontaneous breathing and also for positive pressure ventilation under anaesthesia. The highest RIIV amplitudes were observed with the higher tidal volumes, lower respiratory rates and during mainly thoracic breathing. Coherence has also been tested against trans-thoracic impedance measurements (Nilsson et al 2000) and a CO2 reference (Nilsson et al 2006). The phase relationships between RIIV and the pressure and volume variables appear complex, and have been further investigated by Nilsson et al (2003b). A clearer understanding of these lower frequency components of the PPG waveform is warranted. Consider the recent study by Nitzan et al (2006) where the respiratory-induced variations in the ﬁnger PPG waveform were observed even when an arm blood pressure cuff was pressurized to well above the SBP, giving further evidence for autonomic nervous system involvement.
Various other RIIV extraction algorithms have been investigated: Neural network based pattern recognition algorithm extracted RIIV from reﬂection mode PPG measurements at the forehead and giving low error classiﬁcation rates in the region of 10% (Johansson 2003). Zero phase digital ﬁlter extraction of the breathing interval (BI) in children (Foo and his co-workers 2005) where the mean BI was signiﬁcantly related during tidal breathing and also with externally applied inspiratory resistive loading. Wavelet transformation of the PPG signal has facilitated automated estimation of the respiratory rate (Leonard et al 2006).
Changes in pulse timing characteristics with breathing have also been studied. This includes using the PTT to track arousals during obstructive sleep apnoea, and leading to a clinically useful non-invasive measure of inspiratory effort in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (Pitson et al 1994, 1995). Slow paced breathing and deep inspiratory gasp challenges in autonomic function testing can also induce signiﬁcant changes in the PTT (Drinnan et al (2001) and Allen et al (2002), respectively).

3.2. Vascular assessment
3.2.1. Arterial disease. In the peripheral circulation, atherosclerosis of increasing severity can lead progressively to exercise induced leg pain (“intermittent claudication”), rest pain, and tissue damage in the form of ischaemic ulceration or gangrene (Kester and Leveson 1981).

Figure 7. Example of a multi-bilateral site PPG pulse recording in a patient with unilateral lower limb peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The pulses are shown for the right and left ear lobe, index ﬁnger, and great toe sites, for a period of several seconds. They show the damping, relative delay between legs, and the reduction in amplitude for the toe pulse from the affected side. The clear bilateral similarity of the pulses at the ear and ﬁnger sites is consistent with there being no signiﬁcant proximal arterial disease.
Atherosclerosis is also called peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) whose prevalence increases with ageing, especially from the fourth or ﬁfth decade of life (Hertzer 1991). PAOD is also associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease and stroke, and even the relatively milder degrees of PAOD can signiﬁcantly interfere with the lifestyle and well-being of patients. It is important therefore to establish the exact cause of a patient’s symptoms since other conditions such as musculo-skeletal/spinal disease, and venous disease may also produce the symptoms of claudication (Barnes 1991). Disease detection with PPG is possible because the peripheral pulse usually becomes damped, delayed and diminished with increasing severity of vascular disease (Heck and Hall 1975, Osmundson et al 1985, Kvernebo et al 1989). Figure 7 shows the bilateral dissimilarity in right and left toe pulses in a patient with arterial disease. The majority of published papers appear to have focused on the utility of PPG for lower limb disease detection. Many different features of the pulse have been explored, including risetime, frequency characteristics, width/height ratio, amplitude and shape, as summarized below.
Simonson et al (1955) investigated the risetime of the PPG pulse during reactive hyperaemia in healthy subjects and in those with Buerger’s disease. They showed the relative changes in timing with advancing age and also that the pulse becomes dampened when the circulation is compromised, with changes related to disease severity rather than type of vascular pathology. In 1976, Oliva et al used Fourier transform based frequency analysis to distinguish between legs having healthy arteries and those with atherosclerosis. The fundamental frequency and lower harmonics from patient pulses were compared against normative range values, giving a diagnostic accuracy of 89%. In 1990, Sherebrin and Sherebrin also utilized frequency analysis and showed that the higher harmonic frequencies diminish with age, consistent with the loss of the dicrotic notch feature in older subjects. This study was also important because it considered normative age-related pulse characteristics and protocol issues for obtaining good quality recordings. PPG pulse frequency characterization can also be found in Grohmann et al (1996a, 1996b). Oliva and Roztocˆıl (1983) have also looked at simple analysis methods, including a single pulse measure calculated from the width at two thirds of the foot-to-peak height and normalized to pulse interval. This technique detected 81% of

stenotic and 100% of occlusive disease. Angiography was the gold standard implying that only patients having higher grade disease were studied. Healthy control subjects were not screened with angiography giving some uncertainty in the diagnostic speciﬁcity. In 1996, Carter and Tate investigated the utility of toe pulse amplitude for disease detection and proposed that amplitude was a valuable feature for discriminating limbs with major disease. They also commented that the pulse amplitude was related to skin temperature. Therefore, unless thermal acclimatization is incorporated into the protocol then healthy subjects with a degree of cold sensitivity could also register as having blocked arteries. There is growing evidence that the shape of the pulse contains valuable diagnostic information for vascular assessments. However, the PPG pulse shape can be difﬁcult to describe mathematically. One approach is to use artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) technology since it has the capability to allow nonlinear classiﬁcation of ‘hard-to-deﬁne’ physiological signals, and also has great potential for de-skilling in clinical PPG assessments. An ANN pulse shape classiﬁer developed by Allen and Murray (1993) produced a diagnostic accuracy of 90% in a pilot study of lower limb arterial disease detection. A prospective assessment of the technique in a larger group of subjects (266 legs) produced an accuracy of 80% (Allen and Murray 1995, 1996). The strength of this approach was its classiﬁcation sensitivity compared to the gold standard ABPI test for vascular disease.
Multi-body site PPG measurements have been proposed for peripheral vascular disease detection. In 2000a, Allen and Murray demonstrated the considerable similarity in bilateral (right and left body side) PPG characteristics at three main peripheral sites, i.e. the ear lobes, thumb pads and great toe pads. Cross correlation analysis quantiﬁed the degree of similarity in normal subjects compared to the dissimilarity in a patient with unilateral arterial disease. This study also described the technical requirements for a multi-site PPG measurement system, including the need for electronic matching of the PPG channels allocated to the right and left body sides so that detected bilateral differences were likely to be related to pathology rather than to artefact. Normative multi-site PPG data have been established for pulse timing characteristics (Allen and Murray 2002) and pulse shape characteristics (Allen and Murray 2003). Allen et al (2005, 2006) have also quantiﬁed the diagnostic value of bilateral PPG assessments for detecting arterial disease, using age-matched normative data as a reference (table 1), and also the relative merit of different pulse features on diagnostic accuracy (table 2). The shape index (SI) was introduced as a measure of the abnormal distortion of the pulse contour and provided the greatest accuracy (>90% and giving substantial agreement by the Kappa statistic with the ABPI). Simple timing differences between the right and left side pulse feet were also good at detecting the higher grade disease. The potential for using bilateral (right and left side) PTT differences to detect lower limb disease has also been described in important contributions to the literature by Insall (1991), Erts et al (2005) and Spigulis (2005). Further research is warranted to determine if multi-bilateral site PPG measurements can reliably locate disease within an arterial segment or assess responses to vascular therapy.
Carotid artery disease has been assessed by supraorbital PPG, detecting haemodynamically signiﬁcant disease with an accuracy of 88% (Barnes et al 1977a, Lynch et al 1981). Oculoplethysmography as an adjunct to angiography detected carotid occlusive arterial disease again with an accuracy close to 90% (Kartchner et al 1976, Rasmussen et al 1981, Lane et al 1984). Occlusive disease in the upper limb arteries is relatively rare, although multi- bilateral site PPG technology may prove to have a role here. The prevalence of thoracic outlet arterial compression has been studied with simple unilateral PPG measurements to Adson’s, costoclavicular, and hyperabduction manoeuvres (Gergoudis and Barnes 1980). Further research is warranted since measurements consistent with arterial obstruction were found in a signiﬁcant number of healthy subjects.

3.2.2. Arterial compliance and ageing. The process of hardening (“stiffening”) of the arteries has been shown to start from around the ﬁrst or second decades of life in healthy subjects, and it can be accelerated by medical conditions including renal disease and diabetes mellitus (Avolio et al 1983). Objective assessment of vascular ageing is very important since arterial stiffness is associated with hypertension, a risk factor for stroke and for heart disease. The stiffer the artery the faster the pulse will travel through it to the periphery, i.e. pulse wave velocity (PWV) increases (Bramwell and Hill 1922, Eliakim et al 1971). In addition, augmentation of the forward pressure pulse wave by a fast returning reﬂected wave is also another key feature that can be found in subjects with arterial stiffening. These age-related phenomena have also been explored by investigating PPG pulse timing and shape characteristics.
Generally, the PTT is inversely related to the PWV (Gizdulich 1984). However, the PTT includes the time from the ECG QRS waves to the blood ejection from the left ventricle. Nevertheless, it has been put forward as a surrogate and non-invasive measure of arterial compliance. PTT has been shown to decrease with age at the ear, ﬁnger and toe sites (Allen and Murray 2002) and with the greatest age-associated effect for the toe site (ﬁgure 8(a)). The dominance of the age-related reduction in aortic compliance may explain this ﬁnding for the toes. In the same year Nitzan et al (2002) also published age-related changes in PTT differences between ﬁnger and toe sites for adults. Foo et al (2005a, 2005b) have demonstrated that PTT increases with age in children and have explored the different confounding factors including height and growth (arterial path length) and blood pressure. The transit time of the pulse between two points along an arterial segment can also be used to assess arterial stiffening. In an important study by Loukogeorgakis et al (2002) PWV was assessed using transcutaneous PPG measurements of the pulse wave delay time between different points along an arterial segment. The technique was successfully validated using comparative non-invasive Doppler

ultrasound blood ﬂow waveforms and intra-operative arterial pressure waves. Repeatability data were also reported. Other workers investigating pulse transit time differences between body sites and arterial compliance include: Tsai et al (2005), Foo and Lim (2006b) and Zheng et al (2006).
Age-related changes in the pulse shape characteristics can also yield valuable diagnostic information about the cardiovascular system. A signiﬁcant contribution to the literature has come from Millasseau, Chowienczyk and their co-workers, including the excellent review paper on contour analysis of the PPG pulse waveform measured at the ﬁnger (Millasseau et al 2006). This gave a succinct history of the topic and highlighted the resurgence of interest in PPG-based pulse wave analysis, and with recognition of the clinical importance of arterial stiffness. There have been many developments since the 1940’s in this pulse shape analysis. It appears that digital volume pulse (DVP) contour analysis was initiated by Dillon and Hertzman (1941) who described pulse shape in terms of the crest time and dicrotic notch height. Characteristic changes in crest time and ‘triangulation’ of the DVP were noted in patients with hypertension and arterioslcerosis. The tendency of the notch to rise with systemic vasoconstriction and decrease after inhalation of the vasodilator amyl nitrate was also reported. This degree of dicroticism has been used as a sensitive indicator of the vasomotor effects of drugs. Four classes of DVP have been described by Dawber et al (1973) giving characteristic shapes with advancing age and/or the presence of vascular disease. Allen and Murray (2003) demonstrated the age-related trend towards PPG pulse triangulation at the ear and toe sites as well as the ﬁnger site (ﬁgure 8(b)). Millasseau et al (2002) quantiﬁed the PPG ﬁnger pulse shape using the large artery Stiffness Index and the Reﬂection Index to give information representing arterial stiffness and vascular tone, respectively. The Stiffness Index is calculated from the body height divided by the time delay between the pulse systolic peak and the inﬂection point of the reﬂection wave (units m/s), and the Reﬂection Index is calculated as the percentage ratio of the height of the diastolic notch to the peak pulse height (PulseTrace system, Micro Medical Ltd., Kent). The PPG pulse shape has also been converted to an acceleration plethysmogram to evaluate ageing and vascular disease in the cardiovascular system (Takada et al 1996–97). Their approach uses the second derivative of the ﬁnger PPG waveform to stabilize the baseline and enable the individual waves to be visualized. Four wave patterns were categorized and shown to be signiﬁcantly associated with age and also with a biological marker for atherosclerosis. Takazawa et al (1998) have clinically investigated the effects of vasoactive agents and vascular ageing on these signal components by splitting it into four separate systole waves (named a–d) and a diastole wave (named e). Speciﬁc combinations of wave features were reported to be useful for investigating vasoactive drugs and also vascular ageing. Their derived ageing index was higher in subjects having diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and ischaemic heart disease than for age-matched healthy control subjects. Other researchers have recently reported its potential clinical value for assessing vascular ageing and risk for coronary heart disease (Bortolotto et al 2000, Hashimoto et al 2005, Otsuka et al 2006).
The PPG pulse shape has also been compared with the blood pressure pulse shape in studies of arterial compliance. Lo´pez-Beltra´n et al (1998) formed a peripheral vascular compliance index from PPG signals and found signiﬁcant differences between young and old subjects at low mean arterial pressures and also during a cold-pressor challenge. Transfer function analysis also offers some insight into the dynamic behaviour of the pulse. With the blood pressure pulse (from FinapresTM technology) selected as the input to the cardiovascular model and the PPG pulse at the ﬁnger as its output, systems identiﬁcation methods enable the model parameters to be estimated and tracked in time (Allen and Murray 1999). In this study both simple linear and complex nonlinear neural network-based linear models were

explored for calculating static and dynamic system time constants (i.e. surrogate measures relating to compliance and resistance). By comparing the root mean squared (RMS) error difference between measured and predicted PPG waveforms the neural network approach gave the best shape modelling performance. The relationship between FinapresTM pressure and PPG volume pulses has been shown to provide transfer function gain and phase data for different frequencies in the physiological range (Millasseau et al 2000). In this study the volume pulse formed the model input and pressure pulse the model output. Healthy subjects were compared with patients having hypertension. Changes in the model to the vasodilator, sublingual nitroglycerin, were also investigated. It was found that neither the drug nor hypertension had an overall effect on the transfer function model.
PPG has been used experimentally to assess the viscoelastic properties of blood vessels including the volume elastic modulus of ﬁnger arteries (arterial pulse pressure related to PPG volume change, at speciﬁc transmural pressures, Shimazu et al (1986)). The volume change ratio and pulse pressure in the ﬁnger arteries were simultaneously determined by a combined transmission type near infrared PPG sensor and volume oscillometric sphygmomanometer ﬁtted with water-ﬁlled occlusive pressure cuff. The volume elastic modulus was then determined at a range of transmural pressures. The cuff pressure was automatically inﬂated at a rate of 3–5 mmHg/heartbeat from 0 to 300 mmHg and the changes in pulse amplitude with vascular unloading compared to baseline levels. Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were estimated at the points of disappearance of pulsation and at maximum pulsation, respectively. A clear difference in volume elastic modulus was found between a young subject and an old subject (33 and 65 years of age). Measurements were also compared with the local PWV in the ﬁnger giving a correlation coefﬁcient close to 0.9. Kawarada et al (1986) automated the technique to derive the volume elastic modulus parameter in the ﬁnger of patients with congestive heart failure and also the forelegs of hyperlipidaemic rabbits with experimental atherosclerosis. The animal experiments evaluated the usefulness of the instrument for longterm tracking of changes in arterial properties. Progressive changes in the volume elastic modulus/transmural pressure relationship were observed during the long-term feeding of the cholesterol-rich diet in the rabbits. In the congestive heart failure patients the administration of the vasodilatator, isosorbinate dinitrate, reduced the volume elastic modulus at each set level of transmural pressure. Other workers have used a variety of physiological challenges to perturb the vascular system to assess arterial viscoelasticity, including PPG responses to a local vibration challenge (Pen˜a´z et al 1997).

3.2.3. Endothelial function. The endothelium is the layer of thin specialized epithelium, comprising a single layer of cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels to form an interface between the circulating blood in the lumen and the vessel wall. These cells line the entire circulatory system, from the heart to the smallest capillary. Endothelial cells are involved in many aspects of vascular biology, including vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, blood clotting, atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and inﬂammation and swelling. Endothelial dysfunction is considered to be an early event in atherosclerosis and correlates with major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Endothelial function is often assessed non-invasively by ultrasound brachial artery diameter measurement before and after several minutes of blood ﬂow occlusion to the arm (Celemajer et al 1992). The change in arterial diameter gives a measure of ﬂowmediated vasodilatation. The technique, however, is operator dependent and requires high cost ultrasound imaging instrumentation which could limit its usefulness for routine clinical assessments. PPG has also shown potential for the assessment of endothelial function but is much less costly than the ultrasound approach. Shape-related information can be extracted

from the PPG waveform to quantify vasodilatatory effects with reactive hyperaemia, etc. This analysis could include comparing the height of the reﬂected peak relative to the systolic peak or quantifying the degree of maximal pulse damping.
The potential for PPG assessments to assess vasodilatation has been demonstrated using haemodynamic responses to nitroglycerin (NTG) therapy (Lund 1986). A well-considered PPG measurement protocol was described whereby changes in the dicrotic notch feature of the ﬁnger and toe pulse were studied over several hours to give information about the degree and length of vasodilatation with vasoactive drug. Other workers assessing the effects of vasodilator therapy include Ruiz-Vega et al (1998), comparing the relative height of the dicrotic notch in relation to foot-to-peak pulse amplitude over time. The ﬁnger DVP contour has the potential to help investigate endothelial-dependent dilatation in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (Chowienczyk et al 1999). In 2001, Gopaul et al (2001) also detected endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients using the PPG derived reﬂection index (Millasseau et al 2002). There have been several other important pulse wave analysis studies reported recently but with the pulse measurements obtained using applanation tonometry instead of PPG, these include Wilkinson et al (2002) and Lind et al (2003). It is likely that the literature on PPG-based endothelial function assessment will develop considerably.

3.2.4. Venous assessment. The DC component of the PPG waveform can be used for the non-invasive assessment of lower limb chronic venous insufﬁciency (CVI). CVI often results in the reﬂux of blood through damaged valves in the legs on standing. Changes in the limb blood volume with posture can be tracked with PPG because of the associated changes in light absorption. This approach is sometimes referred to as light reﬂection rheography (LRR) (Belcaro et al 1998, Nicolaides 2000, Incze et al 2003). LRR has been compared successfully with the gold standard invasive ambulatory venous pressure measurement (Abramowitz et al 1979) with the time for the PPG signal to recover to baseline following tip-toe exercises correlating well with the pressure assessment. An example of LRR measurement and corresponding PPG venous traces in health and CVI are shown in ﬁgure 9 (Rheo DopplexTM vascular assessment system, Huntleigh Healthcare, UK). Other researchers have compared PPG assessments and discussed their relative merits with other non-invasive assessments, including colour duplex ultrasound and air plethysmography (Marston 2002). Examples of where venous PPG has been used clinically include: assessing microcirculatory responses to phlebotropic agents in the treatment of leg ulcers (Guillot 1994), assessing age-related changes in calf muscle pump function (Stucker et al 2005), investigating the effect of body position on measurement reproducibility (Sam et al 2006), assessing improvements in deep vein reﬂux following varicose vein surgery (Ciostek et al 2004) and evaluating the haemodynamic performance of football players and wrestlers (Sophromadze et al 2006).

3.2.5. Vasospastic conditions, e.g. Raynaud’s phenomenon. The vasospastic or cold sensitivity condition known as Raynaud’s phenomenon has been investigated using a variety of optical measurement techniques, including PPG. Cooke et al (1985) characterized the PPG pulse shape in healthy subjects and Raynaud’s patients and found that both the pulse amplitude and the slope of the rising edge were good markers for the condition. PPG amplitude also correlated well with thermographic assessments. They also reported the loss of the dicrotic notch in patients with Raynaud’s secondary to systemic sclerosis and associated this with reductions in vessel compliance. Pulse amplitude changes with cold exposure have shown potential for assessing ‘vibration white ﬁnger’ (VWF, also known as hand arm vibration syndrome—HAVS) (Bogadi-Šara and Zavalic´ 1996). This approach has been extended to multi-channel ﬁnger PPG assessments by Dyszkiewicz and Tendera (2006). In the latter study

Venous pump traces obtained using the Rheo DopplexTM vascular assessment system are shown for (b) a healthy subject and (c) for a patient with chronic venous insufﬁciency (CVI). In CVI patients the time to recover to baseline levels, i.e. the venous reﬁll time, is shorter and typically less than 20 s. Furthermore, the efﬁciency of the venous calf/foot pump mechanism can be impaired in patients with venous disease. (Figures are courtesy of Huntleigh Healthcare, UK.)
good sensitivity was reported compared with palesthesiometry, a visual test of skin appearance following hand cooling, and an industrial health questionnaire.
Other experimental PPG-based systems have been designed to understand the mechanisms of vasospasm. The vasomotor control system has been modelled by de Trafford et al (1982) where thermal stimuli were applied to the study hand at different frequencies and the changes in PPG characteristics measured on the contralateral side. Raynaud’s patients had different entrainment responses to healthy subjects. In 1986, Tordoir et al investigated a multi-ﬁnger PPG-based system that measured digital SBPs during air cooling or heating of the hand. Finger responses from primary Raynaud’s patients were different to those with digital arterial occlusive disease. Furthermore, signiﬁcant pressure drops occurred at the ﬁnger of the occlusive disease group with cooling, whereas primary Raynaud’s patients did not show a signiﬁcant pressure change overall. Novel sensors with Peltier ﬁnger heater/cooler devices can facilitate nailfold capillary visualization of red blood cell velocity for comparison with PPG

throughout a ﬁnger temperature challenge cycle (Hahn et al 1999). Blood vessel vasoactivity following cold challenge stress testing has also been studied by Evans and Geddes (1988). Notably, good correlations have been found in Raynaud’s assessments between low-cost PPG and laser Doppler ﬂowmetry during controlled heating and cooling of the hand (Suichies et al 1992).

3.2.6. Microvascular blood ﬂow and tissue viability. Many techniques have been proposed for the assessment of the microcirculation, including radioisotope clearance, infrared thermography, capillaroscopy, laser Doppler ﬂowmetry, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, histology, spectrophotometry, ultrasonography, PPG and (non-contact) PPG imaging technology. The relative merits of these techniques can be studied from papers by Almond and Cooke (1989), Swain and Grant (1989), Malvezzi et al (1992), Brumen et al (1994), Agache and Dupond (1994), Midttun and Sejrsen (1996), Schultz-Ehrenburg and Blazek (2001) and Huelsbusch and Blazek (2002).
Both the anatomy and physiology of microvascular blood ﬂow are complex, with regional differences across the body for the nutritional and thermoregulatory vascular systems. As an example of the complexity of microvascular blood ﬂow Tur et al (1983) have quantiﬁed the basal perfusion of the microcirculation as a function of anatomic position for measurements collected from more than ﬁfty skin surface sites of healthy subjects. Higher regions of perfusion were noted at the ears, ﬁngers, palms and face. The amplitude of the PPG pulse often correlated with laser Doppler blood ﬂow.
Measurement of the tissue perfusion is important for the clinical assessments of viability and healing. Perfusion of oxygen-carrying blood is vital for the preservation of tissue. In plastic surgery the post-operative PPG monitoring of tissue perfusion can detect early problems in free tissue transfer enabling early intervention and salvage (Jones et al 2000). In a study by Stack et al (2003) normative data were established for viable ﬂaps from various donor sites and incorporated these into a hand-held computer for clinical use, reporting excellent results and with PPG performing better than duplex ultrasound measurements. Interruption of the blood supply to the tissues can also lead to pressure sores (Taha 1991). However, objective assessment methods are needed to better understand tissue perfusion and local ischaemia. Murray and Marjanovic (1997) have demonstrated differences in the tissue occlusion pressure as a function of PPG LED wavelength. Their ﬁndings could help in developing better methods to predict who might be more at risk of getting these sores. The role of PPG wavelength in perfusion measurement has also been discussed by de Trafford and Lafferty (1984), Giltvedt et al (1984), Cui et al (1990) and Sandberg et al (2005).
Lee et al (1979) showed the potential of PPG as an objective measure of the healing potential of tissue. If the PPG signal was pulsatile then healing was indicated with conservative management, if non-pulsatile then healing was likely to fail. Similarly, PPG assessments of dental pulp tissue viability have demonstrated pulsatile waveforms synchronous with a ﬁnger PPG reference in healthy subjects and the loss of pulsatility in patients with nonvital dental pulp (Miwa et al 2002). Interestingly, there was a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the tooth PPG signal and subject age in those with healthy teeth. Studies of the blood have also been undertaken. A rheological study by Aldrich et al (2002) showed promise for the identiﬁcation of abnormal haemoglobin concentrations in patients with anaemia by comparing the ratio of pulsatile changes in light attenuation to the changes in light path length.

3.3. Autonomic function
It has already been stated that the PPG signal is composite in nature and has low frequency components relating to respiration, blood pressure control and thermoregulation, as well as

R26

Topical Review

the high frequency components relating to the heart synchronous pulse waveform (Murray and Foster 1996). There is considerable interest in the PPG technique applied to autonomic function including studying the variability of these signal components at the different body sites.

3.3.1. Vasomotor function and thermoregulation. Nitzan and his co-workers have contributed substantially to the PPG literature with many of their research papers focusing on the low frequency and spontaneous ﬂuctuations of the signal. A variety of pulse wave analysis techniques have been used, including power spectral and correlation analysis, to characterize the beat-to-beat PPG amplitude variations attributed to sympathetic activity (Nitzan et al 1994, 1996b, 1996a, 2001), as well as the left body side similarity in low frequency characteristics (Nitzan et al 1998b, Khanokh et al 2004). Further evidence that these ﬂuctuations are linked to the sympathetic nervous system has been demonstrated by the increase in PTT following epidural anaesthesia treatment (Babchenko et al 2000) and the reduction in low frequency variability following thoracic sympathectomy (Nitzan et al 2001). The degree of bilateral dissimilarity in the PPG low frequency characteristics for diabetic patients with neuropathy has also been measured (Nitzan et al 1998a, Buchs et al 2005), with the average right to left ﬁnger pulse low frequency baseline correlation signiﬁcantly reduced from 0.93 (±0.05) in non-diabetic subjects to 0.78 (±0.22) in diabetic subjects, and the average right to left toe pulse low frequency baseline correlation signiﬁcantly reduced from 0.93 (±0.06) to 0.81 (±0.17). Similar reductions in correlation were found for the pulse amplitude. The right-left correlation also decreased with disease duration. In the patient group the correlation data were clearly skewed in distribution. Other researchers have investigated the low frequency variation in PPG waveforms, including Evans and Geddes (1988), Kamal et al (1989), Barron et al (1993), Porret et al (1995), Bernardi et al (1996), Allen and Murray (2000b), Drinnan et al (2001) and Tanaka and Sawada (2003).
Autonomic characteristics of the PPG signal during anaesthesia have shown the relative stability of ear and ﬁnger waveforms measured at different stages of the procedure, with variability attributed to vasoconstrictor activity less apparent at the ear site (Nijboer and Dorlas 1985). Larsen et al (1997) undertook spectral analysis of beat-to-beat changes in the PPG AC and DC components at the ear and ﬁnger sites and compared resting healthy subjects with patients undergoing anaesthesia. At rest, the majority of spectral power was in the low (thermoregulatory) frequency band (<0.08 Hz), with associated ﬂuctuations greater at the ﬁnger than at the ear. Low and mid frequency bands were reduced during anaesthesia but the high frequency band attributed to ventilation was maintained. Quantiﬁcation of PPG waveforms in this way could help to better understand the physiological processes and stages during anaesthesia.
The inter-relationship between sympathetic wave characteristics and changes in ﬁnger temperature, in response to a deep inspiratory gasp manoeuvre, have been considered by Allen et al (2002). The measurement protocol included contralateral hand warming to reduce spontaneous ﬂuctuations in skin blood ﬂow, as recommended by Khan et al (1992). The relative delays between minimal ﬁnger PPG amplitude at vasoconstriction and the corresponding fall in ﬁnger pulp skin temperature were quantiﬁed for healthy male subjects. Both within-session and between-session gasp response repeatability data were provided for the test. An example of the changes in PPG pulse and the beat-to-beat PTT with this protocol is shown in ﬁgure 10. Rauh et al (2003) also showed that PPG was useful for detecting the gasp response and that there was a signiﬁcant correlation between PPG and laser Doppler ﬂowmetry techniques. They found a continuous increase in the correlation coefﬁcient from the ﬁrst to the ﬁnal ﬁfth gasp performed. Interestingly, Kistler et al (1998) showed that vasoconstrictor waves

Figure 10. PPG characteristics during a deep inspiratory gasp manoeuvre. The inter-relationships between gasp and beat-to-beat changes in pulse transit time (PTT) and foot-to-peak amplitude (AMP in arbitrary units, au) can be studied. The gasp-induced reductions in PTT and AMP can clearly be seen along with the respiratory-related variations both before and after recovery from the gasp. The dynamic relationship between the ﬁnger pad skin temperature (Tf) and the pulse timing and amplitude characteristics could warrant further investigation. (Example recording taken from Allen et al (2002).)
at the ﬁnger are more easily demonstrable when the ﬁngertip temperature is above 32 ◦C. The deep inspiratory gasp reﬂexes certainly warrant further evaluation, particularly in female subjects and in different autonomic patient groups. Potential clinical applications include the assessment of secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).
3.3.2. Blood pressure and heart rate variability. The physiological control of heart rate and blood pressure is very important in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, and is often characterized by the baroreﬂex sensitivity (BRS, unit ms/mmHg). BRS can be attenuated in cardiovascular disease. Its non-invasive assessment is possible using beat-to-beat peripheral arterial blood pressure waveforms measured using ﬁnger-pressure cuff/PPG technology (Pen˜a´z 1973, Imholz et al 1998). It has already been stated in the section on blood pressure measurement that there are several devices that can be used for this purpose, including the FinapresTM system. The value of simple and low cost PPG surrogate measures of arterial blood pressure have also been explored for BRS type studies, including the PTT. A degree of coherence between PTT and SBP variability has been shown and that the signals are inversely correlated (Naschitz et al 2004, Payne et al 2006). Further research is needed though before PTT information can be included in routine clinical autonomic studies. The heart rate and its variability are much more straightforward since they can easily be extracted from PPG pulse signals.
As well as the deep inspiratory gasp challenge in autonomic function testing (Allen et al 2002, Rauh et al 2003) slow paced breathing can be performed. This exercise should induce

periodic and synchronous blood pressure (PPG pulse) and heart rate changes. The study by Drinnan et al (2001) showed that PTT at the ﬁnger (and ECG RR interval) is clearly modulated by paced breathing (rate 0.1 Hz). Here, the incremental PTT and RR interval values were calculated on a beat-to-beat basis using an overlapping waveform morphology technique and their variability summarized using simple statistics. The phase differences between the signals were calculated using cross correlation analysis and a strong relationship found overall, with changes in PTT lagging changes in RR by approximately 3 heartbeats (ﬁgure 11).
3.3.3. Orthostasis. Assessment of orthostasis is a growing research area in autonomic function testing, for example in falls and syncope clinics. Changes in pulse with orthostatic stress have been assessed by several researchers. Nasimi et al (1991) investigated sympathetic neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus by monitoring PPG frequency characteristics throughout a supine-to-standing posture challenge. A signiﬁcant difference in the lower frequency components with standing was found in healthy subjects, but with less change detected in the patient group. Nasimi et al (1992) also investigated periodic posture stimulation on local vasomotor reﬂexes. They applied a periodically controlled pulley-tracked movement to the study leg and detected the entrainment across a range of frequencies by both ﬁnger and toe PPG, and largely independent of breathing input. Linder et al (2006) have also investigated beat-to-beat changes in the ear and ﬁnger pulses on standing and have related these to heart rate dynamics. Other areas where assessment of orthostasis is important include military and space research. Jaron et al (1987) assessed acceleration tolerance using a reﬂection PPG probe placed in a region above the superﬁcial temporal artery, and correctly identifying approximately 80% of peripheral light loss (‘greyout’) events.

3.3.4. Neurology. Brain autonomic control is reported to be asymmetrical, with the left hemisphere affecting predominantly parasympathetic function and the right hemisphere affecting predominantly sympathetic function. In migraine patients autonomic function can be assessed by measuring the trigemino-parasympathetic reﬂex to vasodilator response at the forehead with bilateral PPG. In the study by Avnon et al (2003) the cranial parasympathetic function differed among patients with various migraine types, with bilateral sufferers having the greatest amount of vasodilatation and unilateral sufferers the least. In a study by Komatsu et al (2003) the second derivative of the PPG pulse (i.e. the acceleration photplethysmograph) at the ﬁnger had signiﬁcantly different wave features in migraine sufferers during headachefree periods compared to control subjects. Avnon et al (2004) studied left- and right-sided migraineurs outside migraine attacks and found that the left-sided group had signiﬁcantly higher parasympathetic vasodilatation, although the somato-sympathetic vasoconstriction reﬂex at the ﬁnger was similar for both groups. PPG therefore shows considerable potential for neurological assessment, with the capability to give new insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
3.3.5. Other cardiovascular variability assessments. Dutch and Redman (1983) studied cardiovascular activity during psychological stressors with signiﬁcant PTT decreases measured during the cold-pressor test, reaction-time task, video game and problem solving. Vascular tone, that is the degree of vasoconstriction experienced by a blood vessel relative to its maximally dilated state, has also been assessed in patients with haemorrhagic shock (Miyagatani et al 1999), following mood changes whilst listening to music (Matsuura 2002), genital haemodynamics in sexual dysfunction (Prause et al 2005, Brauer et al 2006), physiological studies (Foo and Lim 2006a, Foo et al 2006), haemodialysis (Burkert et al 2006), and the ambulatory monitoring of patients prone to hypoglycaemic events (Harris et al 1996).

4. Summary

This review has introduced the technique of photoplethysmography and has demonstrated its great potential for use in a wide range of clinical measurements. A main focus has been the assessment of the cardiovascular system. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in the technique, and driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. PPG-based technology can be found in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. This success is despite the characteristics of the PPG waveform not being fully understood. Challenges remain with the technology, including the standardization of measurements, improving repeatability, and establishing comprehensive normative data ranges for comparison with patients and for evaluating responses to therapy. Future research is also likely to see developments in the measurement and analysis technology, including PPG imaging, simple endothelial dysfunction assessments, and home diagnostics.
