1. Actiheart Databases

1.1 Recordings Database
1.1.1 Read Info Table

The Actiheart uses two Microsoft Access databases to store data and settings respectively. Access is not required in order to record, read and analyse data. However Access is required if a user wishes to view the details of certain records which are not viewable through the user interface or if a user wishes to customise certain settings. If Access is to be used then it should be version 2002 or later.
The database(s) which hold the recorded data are created and named by the user and by default are saved in C:\Documents and Settings\Computer User Id\Actiheart Data. The software is shipped with a database „actiheartdemo.mdb‟ which contains demonstration files.
The Settings database is also shipped with the software and is placed in the Actiheart Program File during installation.
This database holds recorded data and has five tables two of which, Energy Calibration and Weights are not used. The two key tables are Read Info and User Info.
This is probably one of the most important tables in that it contains all the raw data. This database is populated every time that the Actiheart is read. The following information is stored along with the raw data.
 Computer Name  Computer User  Read Time  Start Time. This is the time at which the recording started.  Serial No.  Bat Voltage. This is the battery voltage when the data was read.  User Id. This is the User name which was used for the recording. If a Test Id
was also used then the User Id field will be displayed as User Id_ Test Id e.g. 99934_ bike + treadmill.  Test type. This is the recording mode, e.g. IBI, Variability , Waveform (see Section 8 of the Guide to Getting Started).  Samples. This is the file size.  Step Size. This is the step size at which a test was conducted and is very important reference information for the reasons given in Section 4.4.  Mask Comments. Describes the type of mask applied to the data. For a description of masks please see Section 3.4.1 on the „Edit‟ tab in long term recording.

1.1.2 User Info Table

This table contains User details many of which affect the calculation of energy expenditure. These are all entered from the AH application and they are:
 User Id  Height  Date of Birth  Weight. This is used to calculate Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) from the  Schofield equations (see Appendix 3). It is also used to calculate Energy
Expenditure from Energy Intensity. The database field is called Start Weight.  Resting Heart Rate (Resting HR). See Section 4.4.8.2 for more details.  Measured RMR. This is whichever value the user has opted for i.e. equation
based or actually measured. See Section 4.4.8.1 for more details.  HR max. This is whichever the user has opted. i.e. equation based or user
entered. See Section 4.4.8.3 for more details.  VO2 max. See Section 4.4.8.4 for more details.

The table also contains individual Activity and Heart Rate calibration data obtained either from the built-in Step Test or from an external calibration.

The Step Test data is generated automatically when a Step Test is saved (see Section 4.5 for more details). The data is contained in the fields labelled Energy 20 to Energy 280. The data is in Joules/min/Kg.

Heart Rate calibration data is contained in the fields Hree 20 to Hree 280 and Activity Calibration data is contained in the fields Act EE 50 to Act EE 6400. This data is entered by the user. Please see Section 4.4.8 on individual calibration for more details.

1.2 Settings Database

This database has seven tables of which only two, PAEE and Step PAI are key operational tables. The PAEE table is shown overleaf. This table contains information about:

 Group calibration equations.
 Branched Model Discriminants and Weighting factors. See Appendix 2 for more details.
 Compensation factors for recovered Heart Rate data and for stress (see Appendix 2).
 Flags to enable individual calibration.

The group calibration equations shown in the table are the default ones supplied with the software but a user can specify his own. The branched model discriminants can also be varied at will. This information can be viewed directly from the application without having to open the database (see Sections 4.3.3 and 4.4.7).

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

1.2.1 Energy Models

WARNING When creating new equations or varying any of the branched model values do not replace any of the default values but create a new record in the database.

The different energy models available to analyse recordings are controlled by entries in the „paee‟ table of the settings database. If you wish to experiment with a new model or combinations of existing models, you may add new rows to this database. You should do this with some caution, and we can make no guarantee as to the energy expenditure results you will gain. You must not alter the existing rows. Each row added to the table will result in a new energy model being added to the list available within the software. Most of the columns needed for each entry are shown in the diagram on the following page, linked to the corresponding entries in the branched model parameters window. The remaining columns are explained immediately below:
ViewOrder: This number determines the order in which the models will be displayed within the software. If adding a new model, simply choose a higher number, for example starting from 100.
ActiheartFlex: This controls the „flex point‟ value of activity counts where the EE prediction switches between a linear projection from the origin to the Act EE equation.
HRflex: This controls the „flex point‟ value of heart rate where the EE prediction switches between a linear projection from the origin to the HR EE equation.
Jap2007Activity: This controls whether the piecewise linear activity to EE model from the JAP2007 paper will be used.
common: This determines whether the model appears when „Show Common Models‟ is selected.

3.0 Activity and Heart Rate

3.1 Short Term Recording
3.1.1 Overview

The short term recording mode is designed for recording up to 440,000 heartbeats. This recording mode allows for detailed heart rate variability (HRV) analysis.1 Heart rate, activity and every Inter-beat Interval (IBI) of the heart rate are recorded in this mode. The epoch length for this mode is fixed at 15 seconds.
Selecting the „Short Term Recording‟ tab brings up the following screen:

3.1.2 Setting Up a Short Term Recording

A Short Term recording is set up in the same way as a Signal Test recording by clicking on the „set-up‟ button then following the set-up wizard .(For further details please see Sections 6 & 7 of the Guide to Getting Started).

3.1.3 Delayed Start for Short Term Recording

Delayed Start allows the user time to set up an Actiheart or several Actihearts and for them to start recording at a time in the future. This can be useful, for example, when setting up a group of subjects together. The maximum start delay is 72 hours. The Actiheart will not begin recording until the start time is reached. All times are taken from the clock on the host PC.

1 The term HRV is a generic term used in this manual to indicate the variability of the cardiac Interbeat Interval. The number of intervals available for analysis and the measure of variability used varies according to the application.

The Individual Edit function is performed as follows:

Right Click and drag to edit individual
points. The ms value is displayed at the cursor

Editing an individual point will affect the next point. It may be necessary to edit
several points.

This process may be repeated for as many regions of the graph as required before clicking „Save and exit‟ to store the edited IBI data in the database.
3.2.8 Editing IBI Data with an external program
A user may wish to export the IBIs to a proprietary program for more sophisticated editing. The procedure below allows the IBIs to be exported for this purpose and to be re-imported once edited and saved with the Actiheart application.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

27

1. Ensure that the editing program is in the Program Files folder on the same PC as the Actiheart application. Ensure that this program is named ‘extedit.exe’.
2. Load AH (short term) file and manually edit the IBIs as necessary. Click „External Edit‟. This exports the IBI data to a file called IBIedit.txt located in the root of the AH Program folder and it calls the external application. (Please note that the „External Edit‟ button is only visible if the editing application mentioned above is resident in the Program Files folder.)
3. Edit the file in the external application and close. When the external program returns its value the new IBI.txt file will appear in the AH edit screen. When the AH edit screen is exited (without cancelling) the edited data is saved in the database.
4. The new information does not overwrite the original data. When the file is reopened from the AH application and edited data is available the user will be asked if they want to use it.
WARNING
The Actiheart application must stay open throughout the editing.
The extedit.exe program must not return until it is complete. Windows programs such as notepad.exe return as soon as they have finished loading and therefore cannot be used as editing programs.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

34

3.6 Auto Clean

The Auto Clean option may be accessed from the „Data‟ menu. Lost or corrupt HR data can sometimes be recovered by applying a cleaning algorithm provided the recorded file is a “Variability” file and not a “Normal” file (see Guide to Getting Started). There are three steps in the cleaning process:

STEP 1: Cleaning

This involves setting suspect values to zero according to the following criteria:

i. If HR < 30 or ii. If HR > 30 and the rate of change of heart rate is > 100, 120 & 160 BPM/Min
for a 1 min, 30 sec & 15 second epoch respectively.

STEP 2: Removing
Spurious Signals
from the Cleaned
Data
The cleaned data is analysed minute-by-minute and if the cleaned HR at any data point is >1.75 * Filtered HR then the cleaned HR is set to zero. Filtered HR is the average of the HR over the 4 minutes preceding the data point being analysed. Between 4 and 16 HR values will be averaged depending on the epoch.

STEP 3: Replacing Removed Data

a) Recovery For each minute where the HR has been set to zero each stored IBI minimum and maximum (there will be sixteen, if the epoch is 15 sec) is used to calculate a HR (60,000ms / IBI) which is then compared with the previous valid heart rate. The calculated HR which is closest to the valid heart rate and within 30 BPM of it is used to replace the zero values. This is termed “Recovered Data”. If the difference is > 30 BPM the calculated HR is not used to replace the zero value.

b) Interpolation Following the recovery process any remaining zero value gaps of < 5 minutes are filled by interpolation (straight line join). If the gap is greater than 5 minutes the value is left at zero. After selecting „Auto Clean‟ the following message will be displayed:

‘This will clean, interpolate and finally remove bad data points. Do you really want to continue?’

Selecting „Yes‟ will apply the criteria to the data and any cleaned data will be displayed as a blue line as shown on the screen below. If the cleaned data is copied and pasted then a comment such as “Recovered”, “Interpolated” or “Lost” is pasted alongside each epoch.

Note that the cleaning process may be reversed by selecting „Restore Raw Data‟ from the data menu.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

35

3.7 Estimate Sleeping HR

This function may be used to automatically determine the sleeping heart rate for the wearer. The software will determine the average sleeping heart rate for all nights of the analysis and then provide an overall average for all days. It is possible to select/de-select which day averages are included in the overall average. The sleeping heart rate may then be saved with the user data.

3.8 Select Day

This option may be selected for the „Data‟ menu and provides a quick means for selecting the full day of data (from midnight to midnight) for analysis.

3.9 Copying data to the clipboard

There are two copy functions available from the „Copy‟ menu:

3.9.1 Copy all data
3.9.2 Copy Circadian Components

This function provides an epoch-by-epoch export for all days of data and includes time stamped Activity, ECG(uV), BPM, and IBI min-max information.
This function provides estimates of the 24-hour components in the heart rate and activity waveforms. Note that the auto clean function as described above must be applied first to ensure that any unworn periods do not skew the data.

4.0 Energy Expenditure Analysis

4.1 Overview

The Actiheart system is designed to calculate Activity Energy Expenditure (AEE) using recorded heart rate and/or activity levels. Short or Long Term recordings as described in the previous chapters can be analysed using the first two applications below. However these applications can also be used in their own right to instigate recordings for subsequent analysis. The third application, the Step Test serves a different purpose from the first two and is described fully in Section 4.5.

4.1.1 Choosing an Application for Making a Recording

If the user is interested in the energy expended in daily living over several days then the Daily Energy Expenditure application can be used. The Actiheart can record in this mode for up to 11 days using a fixed 1 minute epoch. If the emphasis is on high resolution analysis of the energy expended then the recording should be made with either 15 or 30 sec epochs using Advanced Energy Expenditure. In this case the recording duration will be 2.5 days or 5 days respectively. This application can also be used to make a recording with a 1 minute epoch which will be identical to the one made with the Daily Energy Expenditure application. In conclusion therefore Advanced Energy Expenditure has recording capabilities to suit all applications.

4.1.2 Choosing an Application for Analysis

The Daily Energy Expenditure application will calculate and report Activity Energy Expenditure and Total Energy Expenditure day by day.

The Advanced Energy Expenditure application will calculate and report Activity Energy Expenditure and Energy Intensity on an epoch by epoch basis.

4.1.3 Differences between the two Applications

 The Daily Energy Expenditure application cannot analyse IBI (Short Term) files  Individual calibration data can only be viewed and edited using Advanced Energy
Expenditure  Sleeping HR for a user can only be set using Advanced Energy Expenditure  HR max can only be set using Advanced Energy Expenditure  REE can only be set using Advanced Energy Expenditure  Using Advanced Energy Expenditure, the energy calculation mode is selectable,
i.e. Branched, HR only, Activity only (for further details see Appendix 2).

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

37

4.2: Factors Affecting the Calculation of Energy Expenditure

4.2.1 The Branched Model Settings

The calculation of AEE is done using the Branched Model which is described in Appendix 2. The software contains certain default settings (group calibration coefficients and branch parameters) based on validation data. However it is possible to customise these settings in order to create other variants of the model. These settings reside in the Settings database where they can be edited using Microsoft Access. However they can be viewed and applied from either the Advanced Energy Expenditure or the Daily Energy Expenditure applications (see Sections 4.3.3 & 4.4.7)

4.2.2 Branched Model Adjustment in the Presence of Recovered Data

See Appendix 2.

4.2.3 Branched Model Adjustment in the Presence of Stress

See Appendix 2.

4.2.4 Individual Calibration

Individual calibration data can be used in the calculation of AEE instead of a group calibration. The individual calibration can be applied from either Daily Energy Expenditure or Advanced Energy Expenditure. However the calibration data itself, i.e. Activity, HR, PAI which is stored in the User Info table of the recordings database can only be viewed in the Advanced Energy Expenditure (see Section 4.4.8).

4.2.5 Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)

This is required in order to calculate the TEE. By default the program uses the REE estimated from the Schofield equations. However it is possible to replace this value with a measured value of REE. To do this the file needs to be opened using the Advanced Energy Expenditure part of the software. For further details please see Section 4.4.8.1 on measured RMR.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

38

4.2.6 Sleeping Heart Rate (SHR)

This is required in order to calculate AEE. The program will use in the first instance the estimate of SHR if entered with the user details during setup. This may be replaced with a measured value from an overnight recording or another value which is more accurate than the original value entered. The SHR can be changed from one of two locations:

 From the „Utilities‟ tab select database then select a user and edit the SHR  Go to the Advanced Energy Expenditure. Press „View/Edit‟ to bring up the
„Individual Calibration‟ screen (see Section 4.4.8).

4.2.7 Lost Heart Rate Data

Lost or corrupt HR data will affect the calculation of AEE. Therefore whenever a file is viewed in either Advanced or Daily Energy Expenditure an attempt is made to recover any lost data. In those epochs where recovery fails the AEE is solely based on Activity.

There are three steps in the cleaning process:

STEP 1: Cleaning
This involves setting suspect values to zero according to the following criteria:

 If HR < 30 or  If HR > 30 and the rate of change of heart rate is > 100, 132 & 160 BPM/Min
for a 1 min, 30 sec & 15 second epoch respectively.

STEP 2: Removing Spurious signals from the cleaned data

The cleaned data is analysed minute-by-minute and if the cleaned HR at any data point is >1.75 * Filtered HR then the cleaned HR is set to zero. Filtered HR is the average of the HR over the 4 minutes preceding the data point being analysed. Between 4 and 16 HR values will be averaged depending on the epoch.

STEP 3: Replacing Removed Data

a) Recovery

For each minute where the HR has been set to zero each stored IBI minimum and maximum (there will be minimum of sixteen, if the epoch is 15 sec) is used to calculate a HR (60,000/ms) which is then compared with the previous valid heart rate. The calculated HR which is closest to the valid heart rate and within 30 BPM‟s of it is used to replace the zero values. This is termed “Recovered Data”. If the difference is > 30 BPM the calculated HR is not used to replaced the zero value.

4.2.8 Gaps in the Data

b) Interpolation
Following the recovery process any remaining zero value gaps of < 5 minutes are filled by interpolation (straight line join). If the gap is greater than 5 minutes the value is left at zero.
If there are gaps in the data (see below) due to the unit not being worn the cleaning is disabled in the gaps.
Whenever a file is opened from the Advanced EE or Daily EE screen an attempt is made to identify gaps in the data in each day due to the unit not being worn and the user is offered the option of filling these gaps with an average of the day‟s AEE excluding the gaps. If selected the „Auto Fill‟ is automatically applied to all the days in the recording.

In order to decide whether the Actiheart has not been worn the software searches for continuous periods of 2 hours or more of zero Activity.

Selecting „Yes‟ (to auto-fill) or „No‟ will lead to the following screen:

The top region of the screen provides the user details and allows the selection of display units in kCal or kJoules. It is also possible to select just to view the AEE component of energy expenditure rather than viewing all of the components.
The lower section of the display shows the components of energy expenditure day by day.
These are shown graphically and numerically with both being colour coded. Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) is derived by adding to the calculated AEE a component for Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) and a component for Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT). The physical activity level (PAL) is also shown and this is a ratio of daily TEE to REE. The REE can either be estimated using the Schofield equations or can be specified by the user (see Appendix 3 and Section 4.4.8.1 respectively).
For details of how the AEE and REE values are calculated during incomplete days and /or when the monitor is not worn please see Appendix 5.

4.4.8 Individual Calibration

The screen above allows the settings to be viewed. The top left hand window contains a list of all the variants of the model furnished with the software as standard. The components of each variant (calibration coefficients and branch parameters) can be viewed by highlighting that variant in the window.
This screen is accessed by clicking the „View/edit‟ button on the Advanced Energy Expenditure screen.

The individual calibration screen serves the following purposes:
a. It allows an individual calibration for a given user to be saved in the database from where it will be called by the energy model and used as a basis for the calculation of energy expenditure instead of the group calibration. There are three possible sources of calibration data:
i. Step test calibration. If a user has done a Step Test (for more details see later section on the Step Test) then the software will automatically fill this screen with the parameters generated by the Step Test.
ii. Other HR calibration. If a calibration has been performed by some other means the data generated by this can then be entered here. Read the Important Information before doing this.
iii. Activity calibration. If a calibration has been performed by some other means the data generated by this then can be entered here.
b. It is also possible to enter other parameters in the individual calibration screen which have a bearing on the calculation of energy expenditure and are described below.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

4.4.8.1 Measured RMR

4.4.8.2 Sleeping Heart Rate

As mentioned previously, the RMR is normally estimated from the Schofield equations. If however there is a measured RMR for the user this can be inserted here. To revert to the Schofield value, at any time double click in the „Measured RMR‟ box.

It is possible to enter a value for measured sleeping heart rate in this screen. Once saved this will overwrite whatever value was entered for that user in the database when the user was created. If required, the software can calculate this and input it directly (see Section 4.4.15).
4.4.8.3 Maximum Heart Rate

4.4.8.4 VO2 Max

An estimate of HR max may have been entered into the database when a user was
created. This screen allows one to alter the initial value, or to use the Tanaka equation as an estimate2. This is 208 – (0.7 x n) where n = age of the subject.
Selecting the „Tanaka‟ option will allow the estimate to be generated separately for each recording, using the subject‟s age at the time of the recording.

This parameter is a measure of an individual‟s fitness. It is calculated automatically when a Step Test is performed. See Appendix 4 for details of how this is calculated.
VO2 max is calculated from the value of PAI when the heart rate is equal to HR max. To calculate proceed as follows:
 Select the calibration curve i.e. Step Test or Other HR  Ensure that any calibration data extends to the end of the table. If real data  is not available use the Fill function which will extrapolate in a linear manner.  Ensure that the HR max field has a value.  Double click on the VO2 max. This brings up one of the following messages
depending on which calibration was selected.

OR
Selecting „Yes‟ will input a value into the VO2 box. NOTE. The VO2 max value is stored with the User Info in the database. This is the last value calculated either from the Step Test or from the Individual Calibration. Only one value can be accommodated. If the following message appears use the Fill function as described above

Once all of the required parameters have been input into the individual calibration screen, clicking on „Save‟ will save these parameters for that user into the database.

Run External HR/EE Cal: This utility allows recorded Activity and HR data to be exported to an external application where it can be combined in a file with Physical Activity Intensity (PAI) measured with a gas analyser and the data can then be reimported into the Actiheart application for use as an individual calibration.
The external application for combining the data is not provided by CNT.
The procedure for exporting and re-importing is as follows:
a. Ensure that the external program is in Program Files on the same PC as the Actiheart application. Ensure that this program is named exteecal.exe.
b. Load an Actiheart file into Advanced Energy Expenditure application. Press „Run External HR/EE Cal‟. This exports Time, Activity and HR data to a file called exteecal.exe located in the root of the AH Program folder and it calls the external application. (Please note that the „Run External HR/EE Cal‟ button is only visible if the application mentioned above is resident in the Program Files folder.)
c. The external program must return a file of 27 values of PAI/HR and 8 values of PAI/Activity. The returned file must be called ‘ext-ee-factors.txt’.
d. When the file is returned a message will pop up in the Advanced Energy Expenditure inviting the user to save in the database the calibration data contained in the file.
WARNING
The Actiheart application must stay open throughout. The exteecal.exe program must not return until it is complete. Windows programs such as notepad.exe cannot be used because they return as soon as they have finished loading.

4.4.16 Printing and Previewing Data

This is covered in Section 3.5.

4.4.17 Copying all Days

4.5 The Step Test
4.5.1 Overview
The Step Test is a built-in function of the Actiheart software enabling an individual HR calibration to be carried out easily without needing a laboratory or an oxygen analyser. For details of how the calibration curve is derived, please see Appendix 4. The data obtained by the Step Test is also used to provide an estimated figure for VO2 max for assessing a subject‟s level of aerobic fitness. The test lasts for 8 minutes and the stepping speed ramps linearly from 15 step cycles (1 step cycle is „up, up, down, down‟) per minute to begin with up to 33 beats per minute at the end. The stepping speed is dictated either by a drum rhythm or by voice commands. The user can select whether the vocal prompt or drum beat is used in a given test.
Clicking the „Step Test‟ button brings up the following screen:

4.5.2 Setting-Up a Step Test
A user is set up in the same way as previously documented. For further details please see Section 6 of the Guide to Getting Started. Unless a measured value of HR Max is known for the user, leave the HR Max field blank. The application will then use the Tanaka equation by default.

IMPORTANT

Although a range of step heights are provided please note that the Step Test results have only been validated for a height of 215mm.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

56

WARNING

Once the parameters have been inserted and sent to the Actiheart, the screen below will be shown.
If Step Test data for a particular user already exists then use a non-identical User ID to avoid calibration data being overwritten. Using the same User Id with a different Test Id is not sufficient if this is to be avoided.

The software will count down from at least 90 seconds to allow time to put the Actiheart on the user. After the Actiheart has been placed on the user, they should stand still by the step until the test starts. It is possible to select if the rhythm to step is to be a vocal prompt or drum beat. This is done by ticking or un-ticking the „Use music‟ box. At the end of the countdown the last 5 seconds will be a vocal prompt “five, four, three, two, one” and then the software will start the test. The user should step in time to the drum beats/voice prompt. This will be accompanied by colour prompts signifying that the user should step. At the end of the test, the software will count down a 2 minute rest period during which time the user should stand still with the Actiheart still fitted. At the end of this 2 minute period a message will be displayed telling the user that the Actiheart is ready for reading. If at any time the user feels uncomfortable with the test, they should stop immediately and rest with the Actiheart on until the end of the test. The test can be stopped at any time by pressing the stop key and the drum beat/vocal prompt paused using the appropriate keys. Pressing the Stop key twice will allow the unit to be read without waiting for the 2 minute count-down period.

4.5.4 Viewing Details of a Step Test Recording

This is the same as for other recordings; please see Section 3.1.5.

4.5.6 Analysing a Step Test Recording

A recording is selected either by double clicking on it, or highlighting it and selecting „Analyse‟. The following screen is then shown:

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

58

IMPORTANT

The display is divided into three regions. The top region shows the user details such as ID, age, weight and sex of the individual. Also shown is a value of Recovery Tau which is the time constant of the recovery of the heart rate and is measured for the first minute and assumes that the recovery is exponential down to the resting heart rate. On the right are shown derived values of VO2 max. The HR max is obtained from the P max which is the maximum power that can be produced by stepping. The step size is shown just underneath these values.
The central region of the screen shows the activity data as 15 second black blocks derived from the Actiheart. An additional display in red can either be the heart rate in BPM (as shown above), the Heart Rate Variability per 15 second interval is displayed either as max-min or the Root Mean Square of the beat to beat interval. Any 15 second segment of this data can be selected and viewed in the bottom region of the screen where R waves are shown along with activity waveform. A segment is selected by using the scroll bar or by clicking on the upper graph. The IBI is accurately derived to within one millisecond using an algorithm to remove noisy and spurious beats. The actual data values in each 15 second epoch can be displayed by pressing and holding down the left mouse button whilst scrolling in the top graph. All the data can be copied to the clipboard.
The end point of the test which is important for the calculation of the recovery is occasionally set incorrectly by the software. It is possible to set the end point manually to the nearest second in the following manner. Right click in the bottom third of the screen until only the movement waveform is visible. Then double-click on the point where the activity ceases. A vertical blue line will appear at that point and the following message will appear:

4.5.7 The Energy Regression Equations

The Step Test has a linearly increasing step rate from 15 to 33 step cycles per minute after the first minute. As the weight and step height are constant, the energy needed by the user is proportional to the step rate so the energy expended is also linear during the test. A straight line can therefore be fitted to the data.

The resulting regression equations are shown at the bottom of the screen. They are of the form BX+A and these values are displayed along with the R value of the data. An R value of 1 shows a completely straight line fit of the data. For details of how the regression equations are arrived at please see Appendix 4.

The activity equation is provided solely for information. It is not used to derive an individual calibration based on activity and therefore it has no effect on the calculation of energy expenditure. The heart rate equation on the other hand forms the basis of the derivation of a PAI-HR calibration equation which can be used in the branched model in lieu of the group equations.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

59

4.5.8 Setting-Up Multiple Users

It is possible set up more than one user to do the Step Test simultaneously. This is achieved by setting up the required number of Actihearts individually and setting them all to a synchronous start time. Multiple steps will be required.

4.5.9 Marking Bad HR data

When manually reviewing the R wave graph and regions of bad signal are found, it is possible to manually mark a 15 second block as bad data if you do not wish it to be included in the analysis. This may be achieved by using the „Bad HR data‟ checkbox below the R wave graph; a large red „X‟ will appear on the graph to show it is marked as bad data. A small „X‟ will also appear at the top of the upper graph. It is possible to select/de-select each of these marked blocks by double-clicking on the small red „X‟ on the upper graph.

4.5.10 Copying Data for a User

There are 2 possible options for copying data to the clipboard for importation and analysis into an external program such as Excel:

1. Copy Detailed Data: Provides an export with header information and an epoch-by-epoch, time stamped listing of activity and Heart Rate data with IBI and HRV values.
2. Copy Summary Row: Provides a single row export of the results for the current analysis.

4.5.11 Printing and Previewing

It is possible to preview or print the step test report which contains a results summary and graphs of the activity and HR, a graph of the ECG for the currently selected 15 second block, a graph of the Activity for the currently selected 15 second block and a graph of the Heart rate and Activity Energy Expenditure. Select preview to view the report on screen, select print to send the report to the printer.

4.5.12 Create Derived Short Term Recording

This function re-saves the step test data into the database in a format that may be opened with the Short term activity and heart rate analysis.

4.5.13 Analyse All

This is a batch processing function which places on the clipboard a summary row for all the step tests in the selected database. This function also provides the option of saving the individual calibration of each user.

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

4.5.14 Saving an Individual Calibration

The results of the Step Test are not saved in the database unless the „Save‟ button in the right hand corner of the Step Test analysis screen is pressed. Pressing this button produces the following screen:

Clicking „Yes‟ will save the results of the test into the User Info table of the target database which can be viewed in Microsoft Access. For further details please see Section 1.
WARNING
If any of the anthropomorphic variables such as HR max, Sleeping Heart Rate and weight are altered for a completed test then the results will alter accordingly on screen and if ‘Save’ is pressed the original Step Test calibration data held in the User Info database will be overwritten.
If a Step Test for a subject is performed at a later date or time and possibly with a different step height but with the same user ID as previously, it will be logged as a separate test in the Read Info table of the Recordings database. However, when the results are saved, the earlier calibration data held in the User Info table will be overwritten. To avoid this, a unique user ID should be used for each test on the same subject. Changing the Test ID is not sufficient.
4.5.15 Correcting the Step Height of a Completed Test
If following completion of a test it is found that the entered height during set-up was incorrect the value can be changed by editing the Step Size in the Read Info table of the Recordings Database (see Section 1.1.1).

5.0 Sleep Analysis [Research Only]

5.1 Overview

The Actiheart for Sleep software can be used for analyses to aid the detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and to identify the sleep stages [Note that this is an optional software module for research purposes only. It is not verified or guaranteed in any manner and all results should be treated with caution].

Two techniques are utilised in the Actiheart for OSA screening. The first1 (Section 5.5) relies solely on the use of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. This technique
does not attempt to identify specific apnoeic episodes. The second technique (Section 5.6) attempts to pinpoint individual apnoeic occurrences through the use of either HRV alone2 or HRV combined with ECG – Derived Respiration3 (EDR).

EDR is an indirect method of monitoring respiration. It is not as accurate as direct methods that measure airflow directly. ECGs recorded from the surface of the chest are influenced by the motion of the electrodes with respect to the heart due to expansion and contraction of the chest during breathing. The ECG is also affected by changes in the electrical impedance of the thoracic cavity due to the filling and emptying of the lungs. These physical influences result in amplitude variations in the ECG waveform which is inversely correlated with respiration, i.e higher amplitude ECG corresponds to a lower EDR amplitude.

Sleep stage identification in the Actiheart employs HRV analysis based on the findings of Vaughn4 and others but also uses the movement data captured by the
accelerometer in the Actiheart. The algorithm used is described in more detail in
Section 5.4.

5.1.1 Choosing an
Application for
Making a Recording
If the user is interested in conducting a sleep analysis, then it is preferable to set-up the Actiheart from the „Sleep analysis‟ screen since this provides the option of using EDR. Short Term recordings made from the „Activity and Heart Rate‟ tab can also be analysed using Sleep analysis. However these will not contain EDR data. Otherwise in both of these modes, the Actiheart can record up to 440,000 R-R intervals. The maximum recording duration in these modes is 96 hours and the recording resolution is fixed at 15 sec.
Note: The recording duration is dependent on the average heart rate and the signal quality, e.g. the average heart rate for a 24 hour recording is 76 bpm.

5.4 Sleep Staging

The software performs a two-stage analysis of the sleep record. The first stage involves measuring various characteristics of the heart beat record and uses them to derive an empirical measure of „sleep depth‟ at 30 second intervals. In the second stage this measure is combined with the movement record to produce an approximate estimate of sleep stage.
The empirical „sleep depth‟ measurement is calculated from: * Absolute heart rate - a lower heart rate implies greater sleep depth * Size of breathing peak in HRV spectrum - larger implies greater sleep depth * Total of all HRV - smaller implies greater sleep depth The absolute heart rate refers to the average rate during the interval. The breathing peak is a prominent peak in the HRV spectrum (normally around 0.2-0.3Hz) generated as a consequence of heart rate varying slightly with breathing. Slowing and deepening of breathing will amplify the magnitude of the peak. Faster and shallower breathing will have the opposite effect. The total HRV measure includes a wide band of HRV in addition to the breathing peak. Additional HRV outside the breathing peak tends to reduce during deep sleep.
After the sleep depth measure has been calculated for the whole night, the movement record is used to identify periods of waking, and a combination of thresholding and hysteresis is applied to identify the different sleep stages.
The two-stage calculation is necessary because the thresholds vary from individual to individual as a consequence of normal heart rate and HRV variation, and so must be derived from the night‟s data as a whole.
Clicking on the „Sleep Staging‟ tab at the bottom of the analysis screen produces the following screen:

Acceleration is measured in the following manner. The Actiheart contains a piezoelectric element, which generates a transient charge, when exposed to time-varying acceleration. This produces a voltage signal, which is converted into a binary signal by sampling in an 8-bit A/D converter, resulting in 256 distinct levels of acceleration (128 levels of positive and 128 negative levels). The binary signal is stored in a cache 32 times a second and summed up over a specified time period or epoch. An epoch period of 1 min would thus comprise the sum of 1920 samples of the acceleration signal. This represents the area under the curve below.

Acceleration ears

1 Min
At the end of the epoch period, the sum is divided by 16 and then again by 2 N times until the number is below 32. The resulting integer and N are then stored in a single byte (5 bits for integer and 3 bits for N) which is written to the non-volatile memory and the cache is reset to zero. The sum is restored to its original value when the data is read into the computer.
The accelerometer is designed to detect vertical movement with the person upright. It is therefore important for maximum accuracy that the Actiheart be positioned on the chest
so that the sensor is as horizontal as possible. See the Guide to Getting Started for further details on positioning the Actiheart.

250uV 30 BPM to 250 BPM 128 Hz (~8ms) 10MOhms dv/dt with variable threshold Average of the last 16 good IBIs recorded Interpolation is used with a resolution of +/- 1 ms

Heart rate is measured in the following manner: The ECG signal is electronically amplified by a factor of 900. The amplifier has a frequency response of 10 to 35 Hz. The resulting ECG signal is then sampled at 128 Hz. The R wave negative edge is identified by using the Pan Tompkins real time QRS detection algorithm.3 The average difference of ECG samples (n) and (n+1) and ECG samples (n) and (n+2). This average differential measurement removes most of the lower frequency components. Detection for this differential value also compensates for variation in the signal level due to physiological changes and noise.
The Actiheart firmware applies a detection threshold whose sensitivity changes with the amount of physical movement detected by the Actiheart.
At the end of each epoch the R-R interval durations for the last 16 good heart beats are analyzed to get a representative value and remove noisy or missed beats. The 16 values are initially averaged. Any that are outside of +/-25% of this average are removed. The remaining R-R intervals are re-averaged, converted to beats per minute (BPM) and stored in the memory.

Sensor Calibration and Reproducibility

All Actiheart units are calibrated thoroughly on a specially designed rig before they leave CNT. The Actiheart incorporates a calibration factor to produce the same output for the same amount of motion (in terms of g). A standardised Actiheart mounting and positioning protocol is used during calibration. In practice, inherent variation in positioning of Actiheart units means that no two Actiheart units will produce exactly the same output.

Time Keeping

The Actiheart time is set by the PC clock and elapsed time is marked in each unit by means of a crystal oscillator. Selecting a sampling epoch sends an instruction to wait a certain number of oscillations before storing the number of activity counts. This system is also used when any delays in starting of recording are set.

Waterproof Case

The Actiheart is designed to be waterproof. Please see The Guide to Getting Started for further details regarding use of the Actiheart in water.

The Actiheart and Static Electricity

Static discharges will not damage the unit and will not stop the unit functioning. However repeated exposure to static discharge may cause the unit to reset and lose small amounts of data (1/4 sec). The risk of static discharge can be minimised by grounding both the user and subject at regular intervals, particularly immediately prior to attaching the units.

Appendix 2: The Branched Model, Calibration Equations and Other Equations

Estimating Energy Expenditure (EE) from Activity and Heart Rate

Activity monitors use motion sensors (accelerometers) to provide an objective indicator of total body movement. They can be used to assess the frequency, intensity, duration and EE of physical activity. A well described limitation of activity monitors typically worn on the hip is the inability to assess upper body activities such as throwing, catching, carrying or lifting and lower body activity such as cycling. Moreover they are unable to differentiate between walking on the flat versus up or down hills or stairs. Recent studies have documented that activity monitors significantly underestimate EE of common daily activities in adults for all of the above reasons. Heart rate (HR) monitors provide an objective indicator of physiological effect of physical activity. They too can be used to assess frequency, intensity, duration and EE of physical activity. HR has been shown to be linearly related to VO2 and EE during physical activity. However the relationship between HR and VO2 depends on the amount of upper body work that is taking place. HR will be higher for any given VO2 during arm activity in comparison with leg activity or combined arm and leg activity. This is primarily because of the smaller amount of muscle mass involved with arm-only activity. Therefore HR alone will lead to an overestimation of EE. For reliable results the HR-VO2 relationship needs to be derived for a specific individual. Numerous other factors that influence HR under resting conditions e.g. stress contribute additional error when HR monitors are used for extended periods of monitoring of daily activities. Studies (1) & (2) (and others before them) have demonstrated that use of HR along with motion data can improve prediction of energy expenditure for lifestyle activities.

Techniques used for Estimating Energy Expenditure from Activity and Heart Rate

The techniques used for estimating EE from either activity or heart rate alone involve establishing calibration curves of activity vs VO2 and HR vs VO2. This is done in a laboratory usually on a treadmill or a bike (for lower body activity).

If using a treadmill, subjects walk at a variety of incremental speeds and gradients and HR or activity counts are measured and plotted against oxygen consumption (VO2). A curve is fitted to the data using linear regression and the resulting regression equation is used to predict VO2 and hence EE. 1litre of Oxygen = 4.8 kcal= 20kJ. EE is often expressed as an average intensity in terms of metabolic units or METS which represent multiples of resting metabolic rate. 1 MET = 3.5 ml/kg/min or 0.017Kcal/kg/min. HR Calibration curves are unique to an individual, due to physiological variations (stroke volume haemoglobin content etc.).

Actiheart User Manual 4.0.35 (Jan 2010)

82

Calibration curves of activity vary due to biomechanical factors and possibly to the activity mode too. It is more economical in terms of participant and researcher workload to use a group regression equation although individualized regression equations are more accurate.
In the case of both activity counts and HR there is a point below which the linear relationship no longer holds. This is referred to as the Flex Point and it has been used to demarcate resting energy expenditure (REE) from energy expended during physical activity (AEE). The flex point is required when HR alone is used to estimate EE. This is commonly referred to as the Flex HR method and it has been thoroughly validated elsewhere. The Flex HR was first defined as the average of the highest HR during rest and the lowest HR during incremental exercise in a treadmill test. If HR is below an individual‟s Flex HR point AEE is normally assumed to be zero, the only energy expended being resting energy expenditure (REE). For HR values above FlexHR EE is predicted using a regression line. The AEE is set to zero in the classical HR-only model to avoid overestimation of EE in daily living. This does not apply to the model below due to the low weighting given to HR compared with activity in daily living.
Where HR and activity are combined the derivation of the regression line is the same is similar. A multi-linear regression (MLR) equation is derived and expressed in terms of both activity counts and HR. Flex HR is normally not used in such an equation.

The Branched Equation Model for Estimating AEE from Simultaneous Activity and HR

The above techniques rely heavily on individual calibration and have to date been shown to be effective for selected field-based activities and for estimating AEE in free living. Branched modelling proposed by Brage (4) uses movement data quantitatively and has the following aims:

a. To achieve better estimates of AEE than those obtained using MLR. b. To interpret simultaneous HR and accelerometry data into minute by minute
Physical Activity PAI. c. To minimize the need for individual calibration. d. To establish a framework that can be used for estimating more accurately
AEE in free living.

P1 – P4 are weighting factors. X is used to discriminate between activity and “no activity”. Y and Z are used to apply HR thresholds in the presence and absence of activity respectively Y is used to discriminate between walking and running. At running speeds HR is a very reliable measure of EE whereas activity as measured by vertical acceleration is less reliable since during running the latter does not increase linearly with speed. This is reflected by the weighting in Box 1 where P1 is high. At the other end of the spectrum HR is a poor measure of intensity whereas movement registration is more reliable and this is reflected by a relatively low weighting of the HR-EE relationship i.e. P4 is low. Z is used to discriminate between raised HR due to some true activity in the presence of “no activity” (as set by X) and raised HR due to other factors. In boxes 2 and 3 movement and HR are equally weighted. The HR-PAI relationship and the Activity–PAI relationships are given by the group calibration regression equations shown below for adults and children respectively. These have been derived by walking and running on a treadmill in studies conducted with the Actiheart (5) (6) (7) and are included in the Actiheart EE analysis.

The equations below the flex points are derived using the flex point itself and the regression line above it. The HR is not set to zero at the Flex point as is normal for the reasons mentioned previously.
The movement flex point is a relatively new concept (4) which serves to interpolate the intensity curve of activity in the region between rest (0, 0) and the slowest walking speed. HRaS = Heart rate above sleeping heart rate

Default Parameter Values for the Branched Model.

The values below have been validated for walking and running and are believed to be reasonably valid for free living conditions. Formal validation of the values for the latter conditions is in progress. Therefore the values below are subject to minor changes as the branched model evolves and is validated for other activities.
1. Flex HRaS
Flex HRaS is defined as the average above sleep of the highest HR during rest and the lowest HR during incremental exercise during the treadmill test. In (5) RHRaS at is 10 BPM and the HRaS at 3.2 kph is 36 BPM. Thus the Flex HR is set to 23.6bpm.
2. Transition HRaS
This is the average between the highest walking and slowest jogging HRaS. See (5) i.e. 80.4 BPM.
3. X value
Since cycling intensity is best quantified by HR (when using walking/running calibration equations), the value of X is chosen so that observations end up in one of the two top boxes (1 or 2). So a value of X has been chosen which is exceeded in cycling but at the same time is high enough to ensure that “no movement” (including noise) will be quantified by the two lower boxes (P3 or P4).
4. Y value
This is set to TransHRaS
5. Z value
A value equal to FlexHRaS has been chosen as a starting point. However Z is independent of FlexHRaS need not be equal to FlexHRaS.
a. P1 value
0.9
b. P2 value
0.5
c. P3 value
0.5
d. P4 value.

Activity Only or Heart Rate Only Mode

This is a special case of the Branched Model where EE is estimated using either the Activity data or the HR data. In this case the regression equations relating only to Act (PAI-Act) or only to HR (PAI-HR) are used. The weighting (P1, P2, P3 and P4) for the various modes is as follows:

Individual Calibration

NB: HR only mode is useful for any activity, not just walking and running, where the intensity is such that the HR is above the Flex HR
Group calibration is an approximation for a range of individual fitness levels. Heart Rate above sleep HRaS based on individual sleeping HR is used to reduce error but individual calibration is more accurate. Individual calibration equations may be used in the Actiheart instead of the default group calibration ones. The user may derive these values in the usual way by means of a treadmill test as described previously. A typical calibration curve is shown below.

For convenience the AH includes a built-in step–test protocol which can be used for deriving the individual HR-PAI relationship in the field. The Step Test also provides an estimate of VO2 max. Please see Appendix 4 for more information about the Step Test.

Customising the Equations and the Model
Branched Model Adjustment in the Presence of Recovered Data
Example
Branched Model Adjustment in the Presence of Stress

All of the calibration equations and the discriminants and the weighting factors of the Branched Model are held in an Access database and can be altered by a user. For a description of how to do this please refer to Chapter 1 of this manual.
Normally in the branched model the contribution to energy expenditure from activity and heart rate is weighted epoch by epoch according to certain activity and HR thresholds. However since the recovered HR data is obviously less reliable than bona fide recorded data, it may be desirable to override the branched model default weighting factors with another factor which reduces the HR contribution. A “Recovered” factor of 25 means that wherever there is “recovered” data a 25/75 weighting will be applied to the HR/Act respectively in preference to the default weighting for that epoch.
The Recovery factor must be set in the Settings database to a value between zero and 100. If no value is entered in the database the program will set a default value of 25.
In an epoch which falls into Branch 1 the HR would normally be weighted by 90% and the Activity by 10%. However if the HR data within the epoch is “Recovered” data and the “Recovered” factor is set to 15 then the HR within that epoch will be weighted by 15% and the activity by 85%.
This allows the normal HR data weighting to be reduced where there is a raised HR in the absence of sufficient activity. This compensation works in a similar way to the Recovery factor. Again this stress factor overrides the default weighting. The following criterion is used for deciding whether the raised HR in an epoch is likely to be due to stress. If the activity in the previous three minutes of activity is < 25 counts per minute then the stress correction factor is applied. 25 is equal to the value of X in the Branched Model.
If an epoch where stress is detected has recovered data which has had a Recovery Factor applied to it then the stress factor will override the recovery factor.
The stress factor is set in the Settings database. If the box is left empty then the stress compensation is disabled.

Example

In an epoch with good HR data which falls into Branch 1 the HR would normally be weighted by 90% and the Activity by 10%. However if the stress factor is set to 0.1 then the HR /Act weighting which is applied will be 10%/90%.
In an epoch with recovered data which has a Recovery factor of 25 applied to it the HR would be weighted by 25% and the Activity by 75%. However if that epoch is identified as a “stress” epoch and the stress factor is .2 then the weighting applied to HR/Activity will be 20% / 80%

Appendix 4: The Step Test Calculations

HR Calibration

The built –in step can be used to derive an individual HR calibration equation without needing access to a laboratory and an oxygen analyser. Derivation of the Physical Activity Intensity (PAI) – HR calibration equation is a 4-step process.
1. The recovery HR  is measured
2. The power Pstep generated during stepping in Joules/min/kg is calculated as follows:
Joules/kg/min = Vertical distance (m) x steps /min

3. P step and HR step values are plotted and a straight line is fitted to the data

4. PAI vs HRaS is then established a function of HRaS,  , _HRaS step, _HRaS step:
PAI = 2.9∙HRaS + 1.1∙HRaS∙male sex + 2.9∙HRaS∙βstep + 1.3∙αstep - 10∙male sex + zero*  + zero*  ∙HRaS + zero *age + zero *height -75 + zero* BMI

This equation is valid for adults and is referred to in Reference No. 7 in Appendix 2. There „zero‟ multiplier terms in the equation are not being used, so mean literally zero. They were inserted into the software for future flexibility if those parameters are found to increase accuracy, but are not currently used.
The resulting PAI - HR line thus obtained for an individual is then extrapolated to the assumed HR max for the person‟s age. The predicted VO2 max in litres /kg /min is then equal to PAI max in J /kg.min /20.2.
HRaSmax =HRmax-SHR. The maximum HR for an individual is predicted from age (HR max =208-0.7*age) and is based on a meta-analysis done by Tanaka et al:*
*Tanaka H, Monahan KD, Seals DR. Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited. J `Am.Coll.Cardiol. 2001; 37(1):153-56.
If individual calibration is based not on Step Test data but on measured HR and VO2 data e.g. in a laboratory the external data can be imported into the AH.
