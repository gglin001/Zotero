VARIABILITY
Heart rate variability (HRV) describes the variations between consecutive inter-beat-intervals or IBIs. Both sympathetic

and parasympathetic branches of the ANS are involved in

the regulation of heart rate (HR). Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity increases HSaRvinagndto dMecy rLeibarasrey s HRV,

The

control of the autonomic output involves several

interconnected areas of central nervous system, which form

the so-called central autonomic network. In addition to this

central control, arterial baroreceptor reflex as well as

respiration are known to induce quick changes in heart rate.

The baroreflex is based on baroreceptors which are located

on the walls of some large vessels and can sense the

stretching of vessel walls caused by pressure increase. Both

sympathetic and parasympathetic activity are influenced by

baroreceptor stimulation trough a specific baroreflex arc

(Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Functioning of the barorelfex arc.
Typically, the most conspicuous oscillatory component of HRV is the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), where the vagus nerve stimulation is being cut-off during inhalation, and thus, HR increases during inhalation and decreases during exhalation (see video below). This high frequency (HF) component of HRV is thus centered at respiratory frequency and is considered to range from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz. Another conspicuous component of HRV is the low frequency (LF) component ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz. The HF component is mediated almost solely by the PNS activity, whereas the LF component is mediated by both SNS and PNS activities and is also affected by baroreflex activity Task Force 1996, Berntson et al. 1997 . The origin of the LF

oscillations is however considered to be dominated by SNS and the normalized power of the LF component could be used to assess sympathetic efferenSat vaincgtivtoity MPyagLaibnriareyt al. 1997, Furlan et al. 2000. The fluctuations below A0b.o0u4t HHRzV, on the other hand, have not been studied as mSuncahpshaost the higher frequencies. These frequencies are commonly divided into very low frequency (VLF, 0.003-0.04 Hz) and ultra low frequency (ULF, 0-0.003 Hz) bands, but in case of shortterm recordings the ULF band is generally omitted Task Force 1996. These lowest frequency rhythms are characteristic for HRV signals and have been related to, e.g., humoral factors such as the thermoregulatory processes and reninangiotensin system Berntson et al. 1997. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a commonly used tool when trying to assess the functioning of cardiac autonomic regulation. It has been used in multitude of studies, related to cardiovascular research and different human wellbeing applications, as an indirect tool to evaluate the functioning and balance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

HRV TIME SERIES

QRS detection

Figure 2: Electrophysiology of the heart (redrawn from Malmivuo & Plonsey 1995). The different waveforms for each of the specialized cells found in the heart are shown. The latency shown approximates that normally found in the healthy heart.
The aim in HRV analysis is to examine the sinus rhythm modulated by the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, one should technically detect the occurrence times of the SA-node action potentials, which initiate every heart beat. In practical applications, this is not however possible. Instead, an the electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded by placing two or more electrodes on skin contact and heart beats are detected from the ECG. The nearest observable activity in the ECG compared to SA-node firing is the P-wave resulting from atrial depolarization (see Fig. 2). The signal-to-noise ratio of the P-wave is, however, clearly lower than that of the strong QRS complex which results primarily from ventricular depolarization. Therefore, the heart beat period is commonly evaluated as the time difference between the easily

detectable QRS complexes. A typical QRS detector consists

of a preprocessing part followed by a decision rule. Several

The accuracy of the R-wave occurrence time estimates is
often required to be 1–2 ms, and thus, the sampling frequency of ECG should be at least 500–1000 Hz Task Force 1996. If the sampling frequency of ECG is less than 500 Hz,
the errors in R-wave occurrence times can cause critical
distortion to HRV analysis results, especially to spectrum estimates Merri et al. 1990. The distortion of the spectrum is even bigger if the overall variability in heart rate is small Pinna et al. 1994. The estimation accuracy can however be improved
by interpolating the QRS complex e.g. by using a cubic spline interpolation Daskalov et al. 1997 or some model based approach Bragge et al. 2005.

Pulse detection
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a technique for monitoring blood volume changes in the micro vascular bed of tissue. Shortly after the QRS complex appears in the ECG, the ventricular systole generates a pulse wave which leads to a rapid increase in blood pressure and blood volume, this change is seen by the steep rise in the pulse wave (see Fig. 3). The subsequent decline corresponds to cardiac diastole and may contain a secondary peak, the so-called dicrotic notch, which is attributed to the closure of the aortic valve. Pulse-to-pulse interval (PP-interval) is defined as a time interval between the rising part of two consecutive pulse waves.

Figure 3: Normal PPG end ECG signal and definitions of pulse transmit time (PTT) and pulse to pulse interval

(PP).
Depending on the pulse wave velocSiatyviangndtothMeyvLaibsrcaruylar path from the heart, there is a delay betweeAnboeuat HchRVQRS complex and the onset of its corresponding pulse wave. The delay is called pulse transit time (PTT) and is nSenagpasthivoet ly correlated with blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and age. Physiological variability in PTT causes deviation between the PP-intervals and the RR-intervals. Since PP and RR intervals are not equal, it is always better to use the term pulse rate variability (PRV) rather than HRV when PPG measurement is used. Usability and accuracy of PRV as an estimate of HRV has been widely studied. A good review on the topic can be found from Schafer et al 2013, with the following concluding remarks:
PRV as an estimate of HRV has been proved to be sufficiently accurate only for healthy (and mostly younger) subjects at rest. Moderate physical or mental stress tends to diminish agreement between PRV and HRV to an extent that is or is not acceptable. Physically more active states, such as walking or physical exercising, the agreement between PRV and HRV often becomes insufficient, mostly due to motion artifacts.
Beat detection algorithms in Kubios HRV
software
In case ECG data is imported into Kubios HRV software, the R-wave time instants are automatically detected by applying a built-in QRS detection algorithm. This in-house developed detection algorithm is based on the Pan–Tompkins algorithmPan & Tompkins 1985. The detector consists of a preprocessing part followed by decision rules.The preprocessing part includes bandpass filtering of the ECG (to reduce power line noise, baseline wander and other noise components), squaring of the data samples (to highlight peaks) and moving average filtering (to smooth close-by peaks). The decision rules include amplitude threshold and comparison to expected value between adjacent R-waves. Both of these rules are adjusted adaptively every time a new R-wave is acceptably detected. Before R-wave time instant extraction, the R-wave is interpolated at 2000 Hz to improve the time resolution of detection. The up-sampling can significantly improve the time resolution of R-wave detection when the sampling rate of the ECG is low.

The errors in standard HRV parameters when computed from PRV compared to HRV time series (right axes); where red lines show the median, the box shows the 25-75 percentiles, and the whiskers show the most extreme error values.
Pulse wave detector of Kubios HRV software is based on the matched filtering approach. Firstly, maximum of 1st derivative representing the steepest part of the pulse wave is used for initial pulse location estimation. Secondly, a template for the pulse wave (and matched filter) is constructed using the initial pulses. Decision of the final pulse wave locations are defined by comparing the filtered signal against varying threshold and comparing normalized error between the template and the PPG signal. Allowed normalized error between template and pulse wave under inspection can be adjusted in software preferences. That is, the smaller the acceptance threshold percent is the more similar the pulse wave have to be with the template in order to be accepted. The accuracy of the pulse wave detection algorithm is shown in Fig. 4. The left panel showing the Bland-Altman plot illustrating the agreement between detected PP intervals and corresponding RR intervals during a resting measurement. The right panel shows error percentages of commonly used HRV parameters estimated from PP interval compared to RR interval time series. Used dataset contains 20 healthy volunteers with wide age scale (20 to 50 years). The error between the RR and PP intervals was -0.01±5.16 ms (mean ± SD). This ±5 ms error in heart beat detection produces approximately ±10 % maximum errors to the HRV parameters.
Inter-beat interval (IBI) time series

Saving to My Library
About HRV Snapshot

Figure 5: Derivation of two HRV time series from ECG: the interval tachogram (middle panel) and interpolated RR interval series (bottom panel).

After the beat occurrence times (i.e. QRS complex or pulse

wave fiducial points) have been detected, an inter-beat

interval (IBI) time series can be derived. Instead of IBI, we

will here use the term RR interval, which refers to time

interval between successive ECG R-wave occurrence times.

The n‘th RR interval is obtained as the difference between

the R-wave occurrence times

. In some

context, normal-to-normal (NN) may also be used when

referring to these intervals indicating strictly intervals

between successive QRS complexes resulting from SAnode depolarization Task Force 1996. In practice when

analysing normal sinus rhythm, the NN and RR intervals are

the same, and thus, the term RR is preferred here.

The time series constructed from all available RR intervals is
not equidistantly sampled, but has to be presented as a
function of time, i.e. as values ( , ). This fact has to be
taken into account before frequency-domain analysis. In
general, three different approaches have been used to get around this issue Task Force 1996. The simplest approach that have been adopted e.g. in Baselli et al. 1987 is to assume
equidistant sampling and calculate the spectrum directly
from the RR interval tachogram (RR intervals as a function
of beat number), see Fig. 5 middle panel. This assumption can however cause distortion into the spectrum Mateo et al. 2000. This distortion becomes substantial when the variability
is large in comparison to the mean RR interval length.

Furthermore, the spectrum can not be considered to be a function of frequency, but rather a function of cycles per beat Task Force 1996, see Fig. 5 bottom pSaanveinl.gOtoneMcyhLiobircarey for the interpolation method is the cubic splinAeboinutteHrRpVolation Mateo et al. 2000. After interpolation, regular sSpneapcstrhuomt estimation methods can be applied. The third general approach is to apply methodology, which are designed for analysing nonequidistantly sampled data. Such a method is for example the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, which computes the periodogram spectrum estimate for non-equidistantly sampled data van Dongen et al. 1999.
PREPROCESSING OF RR DATA
(↥ Back to top)
Careful preprocessing of RR interval data is very important before analysing or interpreting HRV data. Any artefact in the RR interval time series may significantly interfere the analysis of these signals. The artefacts within HRV signals can be divided into technical and physiological artefacts. The technical artifacts include missing, extra or misaligned QRS complex detections. These artefacts may be due to measurement noise or due to incompetence of the detection algorithm. Physiological artefacts include ectopic beats and arrhythmic events. In order to avoid the interference of such artefacts, the ECG recording and the corresponding event series should always be manually checked for artefacts and only artefact-free sections should be included in the analysis Task Force 1996. Alternatively, if the amount of artefact-free data is insufficient, proper interpolation methods can be used to reduce these artefacts, see e.g. Lippman et al. 1993, Lippman et al. 1994, Mateo et al. 2003.
In addition to artefacts, slow changes in mean HR during the recording can have undesirable effects on certain HRV analysis parameters. Such slow nonstationarities are characteristic for HRV signals and should be considered before the analysis. The origins of nonstationarities in HRV are discussed e.g. in Berntson et al. 1997. The slow nonstationary trends can be easily removed from the HRV time series before analysis. Detrending can be performed using first order Litvack et al. 1995, Mitov et al. 1998 or higher order polynomial Porges et al. 1990, Mitov et al. 1998 models. In addition, Kubios HRV software includes an advanced detrending procedure originally presented in Tarvainen et al. 2002. This approach is based on smoothness priors regularization and is described in detail below.

Artefact correction methods

artefacts. First, the R-wave detectioAnbsouct aHnRV be corrected

manually when

Snapshot

ECG data is available, which provides true beat intervals but

is reasonable only when when data includes a limited

number of misdetections. Secondly, the software includes

two artefact correction methods: 1) Threshold based

correction algorithm, and 2) Automatic correction algorithm.

Details of these correction methods are given below.

Threshold based artefact correction algorithm
The threshold based artefact correction algorithm compares every RR interval value against a local average interval. The local average is obtained by median filtering the RR interval time series, and thus, the local average is not affected by single outliers in RR interval time series. If an RR interval differs from the locale average more than a specified threshold value, the interval is identified as an artefact and is marked for correction. The threshold value can be selected from:
Very low: 0.45 sec (threshold in seconds) Low: 0.35 sec Medium: 0.25 sec Strong: 0.15 sec Very strong: 0.05 sec Custom, for setting a custom threshold in seconds
For example, the “Medium” correction level will identify all RR intervals that are larger/smaller than 0.25 seconds compared to the local average. The correction is made by replacing the identified artefacts with interpolated values using a cubic spline interpolation. It should be noted, that these threshold are adjusted with mean heart rate. That is, thresholds shown above are for HR of 60 beats/min, but for higher HR the thresholds are smaller (because the variability is expected to decrease when HR increases) and vice versa for lower heart rates.
Because the artefacts are identified by simple thresholding and normal HRV level is highly individual, the correction level should be adjusted individually as follows. First, identify if there are any artefacts in your data that should be corrected. If there are artefacts, then select the lowest possible correction level, which identifies the artefacts but does not identify too many normal RR intervals as artefacts.

Automatic artefact correction algorithm
Saving to My Library
In automatic correction algorithm artefacts are detected from dRR series, which is a time series coAnbsoisuttiHnRgVof differences between successive RR intervals. The dSnRaRpshsoet ries provides a robust way to separate ectopic and misplaced beats from the normal sinus rhythm. To separate ectopic and normal beats, time varying threshold (Th) is used. To ensure adaptation to different HRV levels, the threshold is estimated from the time-varying distribution of dRR series. For each beat, quartile deviation of the 90 surrounding beats is calculated and multiplied by factor 5.2. Beats within this range cover 99.95% of all beats if RR series is normally distributed. However, RR interval series is not often normally distributed, and thus, also some of the normal beats exceed the threshold. Therefore, decision algorithm is needed to detect artefact beats.

different levels of displacement) beats.

Ectopic beats form negative-positive-negative (NPN) or

positive-negative-positive (PNP) patterns to the dRR series.

Similarly long beats form positive-negative (PN) and short

beats negative-positive (NP) patterns to the dRR series.

Only dRR segments containing these patterns are classified

as artefact beats. Missed or extra beats are detected by

comparing current RR value with median of the surrounding

10 RR interval values (medRR). A missed beat is detected if

current RR interval (RR(i)) satisfies condition

(1)

and an extra beat is detected if two successive RR intervals (RR(i) and RR(i+1)) satisfies condition
(2)
Correction of detected artefacts: Detected ectopic beats are corrected by replacing corrupted RR times by interpolated RR values. Similarly too long and short beats are corrected by interpolating new values to the RR time

series. Missed beats are corrected by adding new R-wave

Detrending of RR interval data

The theory behind the smoothness priors detrending
methods inluded in Kubios HRV software is described shortly here. For more details, see Tarvainen et al. 2002.

Let

denote the RR interval time series which can be

considered to consist of two components

(3)

where

is the nearly stationary RR interval series of

interest,

is the low frequency aperiodic trend

component, and is the number of RR intervals. Suppose

that the trend component can be modeled with a linear

observation model as

(4)

where

is the observation matrix,

are the

regression parameters, and is the observation error. The

task is then to estimate the parameters by some fitting

procedure so that

can be used as the estimate

of the trend. The properties of the estimate depend strongly

on the properties of the basis vectors (columns of the matrix

) in the fitting. A widely used method for the solution of the

estimate is the least squares method. However, a more

general approach for the estimation of is used here. That

is, the so-called regularized least squares solution

(5)

where is the regularization parameter and indicates the discrete approximation of 2nd order derivative. This is a modification of the ordinary least squares solution, dragging the solution to the direction in which the norm gets smaller. In this way, prior information about the predicted trend can be implemented to the estimation. The solution of (5) can be written in the form
(6)

and the estimate for the trend which is to be removed can be written as
(7)

The selection of the observation matrix

can be

implemented according to some known properties of the data . However, here we use aSatrviviniagl tochMoiycLeibroarfy identity

matrix

. In this case, theAbroeugtuHlaRVrization part of

(5) simply draws the solution towards aSncauprsvheotfor which the

2nd order difference is zero, i.e. towards first order linear

curve. With these specific choices, the detrended nearly

stationary RR series can be written as

(8)

This detrending method works like a time-varying highpass filter, where the cutoff frequency can be adjusted by changing the smoothing parameter . In Kubios HRV Premium software, the cutoff frequency related to the given smoothing parameter is presented. The smoothing parameter is by default selected to remove only VLF frequency components from the RR time series.

HRV ANALYSIS METHODS
(↥ Back to top)
In this section, the analysis methods available in Kubios HRV software are introduced. The presented methods are mainly based on the guidelines given in Task Force 1996. The presentation of the methods is divided into four categories, i.e. time-domain, frequency-domain, nonlinear, and timevarying methods. The methods are summarized in Table 1.

Time-domain methods

The time-domain methods are derived from the beat-to-beat

RR interval values in time domain. Let the RR interval time

series include

successive beat intervals, i.e.

. The mean RR interval ( )

and the mean heart rate ( ) are then defined as

(9)

where

denotes the value of ‘th RR interval. Several

HRV parameters that measure the variability within the RR

time intervals in time-domain exist. The standard deviation

of RR intervals (SDNN) is defined as

(10)
Saving to My Library
About HRV
SDNN reflects the overall (both short-tSenrampshaont d long-term) variation within the RR interval time series, whereas the standard deviation of successive RR interval differences (SDSD) given by

(11)

is a measure of short-term (beat-by-beat) variability. For

stationary

RR

series

and SDSD

equals the root mean square of successive differences

(RMSSD) given by

(12)

Another measure calculated from successive RR interval differences is the NN50 which is the number of successive intervals differing more than 50 ms or the corresponding relative amount
(13)

Figure 6: Computation of geometric measures of HRV: A) triangular index (HRVi) and triangular interpolation of RR intervals (TINN), and B) Baevsky’s stress index.
In addition to the above statistical measures, there are some geometric measures that are calculated from the RR interval histogram. The HRV triangular index is obtained as the integral of the histogram (i.e. total number of RR intervals) divided by the height of the histogram which depends on the selected bin width. In order to obtain comparable results, a bin width of 1/128 seconds is recommended Task Force 1996.

Another geometric measure is the TINN which is the
baseline width of the RR histogram evaluated through triangular interpolation, see Figure 6SAav.ing to My Library

About HRV

The Baevsky’s stress index (SI) is computed according to

the formula Baevsky 2009

Snapshot

(14)

where AMo is the so-called mode amplitude presented in percent, Mo is the mode (the most frequent RR interval) and MxDMn is the variation scope reflecting degree of RR interval variability (see Figure 6B). The mode Mo is simply taken as the median of the RR intervals. The AMo is obtained as the height of the normalised RR interval histogram (bin width 50 msec) and MxDMn as the difference between longest and shortest RR interval values. In order to make SI less sensitive to slow changes in mean heart rate (which would increase the MxDMn and lower AMo), the very low frequency trend is removed from the RR interval time series by using the smoothness priors method Tarvainen et al 2002. In addition, the square root of SI is taken to transform the tailed distribution of SI values towards normal distribution. The square root transformation also makes the SNS index described later less sensitive to extreme SI values.

Frequency-domain methods
In the frequency-domain methods, a power spectrum density (PSD) estimate is calculated for the RR interval series. The regular spectrum estimators implicitly assume equidistant sampling and, thus, the RR interval series is converted to equidistantly sampled series by interpolation methods prior to spectrum estimation. In Kubios HRV software a cubic spline interpolation method is used. In HRV analysis, the spectrum is generally estimated using either a Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) based methods or parametric autoregressive (AR) modeling based methods. For details on these methods see, e.g., Marple 1987. The advantage of FFT based methods is the simplicity of implementation, while the AR spectrum yields improved resolution especially for short samples. Another property of AR spectrum that has made it popular in HRV analysis is that it can be factorized into separate spectral components.
In Kubios HRV software, the HRV spectrum is calculated with FFT based Welch’s periodogram method and with the AR method. Spectrum factorization in AR method is optional. In the Welch’s periodogram method the HRV

sample is divided into overlapping segments. The spectrum

is then obtained by averaging the spectra of these segments, which decreases theSavvianrgiatnoceMy oLifbratrhy e FFT

spectrum.

About HRV

Kubios HRV software includes alsoSntahpeshoLt omb-Scargle periodogram van Dongen et al. 1999, which differs from the

Welch’s periodogram in the sense that it does not assume

equidistant sampling and is thus computed directly from the

non-interpolated RR interval time series. The variance of the

Lomb-Scargle periodogram is decreased by smoothing the

periodogram using MA-filering (the window width of the MA-

filter can be adjusted in software preferences).

Figure 7: HRV spectrum estimates using FFT based Welch’s periodogram method (left) and autoregressive (AR) modelling based spectrum estimation method.
The generalized frequency bands in case of short-term HRV recordings are the very low frequency (VLF, 0–0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF, 0.15– 0.4 Hz). The frequency-domain measures extracted from a spectrum estimate for each frequency band include absolute and relative powers of VLF, LF and HF bands; LF and HF band powers in normalized units; the LF/HF power ratio; and peak frequencies for each band (see Table 1). In the case of FFT spectrum, absolute power values for each frequency band are obtained by simply integrating the spectrum over the band limits. In the case of AR spectrum, on the other hand, if factorization is enabled distinct spectral components emerge for each frequency band with a proper selection of the model order and the absolute power values are obtained directly as the powers of these components. If factorization is disabled the AR spectrum powers are calculated as for the FFT spectrum. The band powers in relative and normalized units are obtained from the absolute values as described in Table 1.
Nonlinear methods
Considering the complex control systems of the heart it is reasonable to assume that nonlinear mechanisms are

involved in heart rate requlation. The nonlinear properties of

HRV have been analysed using measures such as Poincaré

During the last years, the number of studies utilizing such

interpretation of the results.

of the correlation between successive RR intervals, i.e. plot

of

essential and a common approach to parameterize the

shape is to fit an ellipse to the plot as shown in Fig. 8. The

ellipse is oriented according to the line-of-identity (

). The standard deviation of the points

perpendicular to the line-of-identity denoted by SD1

describes short-term variability which is mainly caused by

RSA. It can be shown that SD1 is related to the time-domain measure SDSD according toBrennan et al. 2001

The standard Poincaré plot can be considered to be of the

first order. The second order plot would be a three

Approximate entropy
Approximate entropy (ApEn) measures the complexity or irregularity of the signal Richman & Moorman 2000, Fusheng et al. 2001. Large values of ApEn indicate high irregularity and smaller values of ApEn more regular signal. The ApEn is computed as follows.
First, a set of length vectors is formed

Thus, the value of the estimate ApEn depends on three

parameters, the length of the vectors , the tolerance

value , and the data length . In Kubios HRV software the

default value of is set to be

. The length of the

data also affects ApEn. When is increased the ApEn

approaches its asymptotic value. The tolerance has a

strong effect on ApEn and it should be selected as a fraction

of the standard deviation of the RR interval data (SDNN).

This selection enables the comparison of RR data from

different subjects. A common selection for

, which is also the default value in Kubios

HRV software.

Sample entropy

Sample entropy (SampEn) is similar to ApEn, but there are

two important differences in its calculation Richman & Moorman

2000, Lake et al. 2002. For ApEn, in the calculation of the number

of vectors for which

Multiscale entropy (MSE)

Multiscale entropy (MSE) is an extension of SampEn in the sense that it incorporates two procedures Costa et al. 2005

1. A coarse-graining process is applied to the RR interval

time series. Multiple coarse-grained time series are

constructed for the time series by averaging the data

the coarse-grained time series is simply the original beat-

2. SampEn is calculated for each coarse-grained time

series. SampEn as a function of the scale factor

produces the MSE. MSE for scale factor

returns

standard SampEn (computed from the original data

points).

Detrended fluctuation analysis
Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) measures the correlation within the signal. The correlation is extracted for different time scales as follows Peng et al. 1995. First, the RR interval time series is integrated

Correlation dimension

Another method for measuring the complexity or strangeness of the time series is the correlation dimension which was proposed in Grassberger et al. 1983. The correlation dimension is expected to give information on the minimum number of dynamic variables needed to model the underlying system and it can be obtained as follows.

Similarly as in the calculation of approximate and sample entropies, form length vectors

(27)

which is the so-called correlation integral. The correlation dimension
is defined as the limit value
(31)

In practice this limit value is approximated by the slope of

the regression curve

Henry et al. 2001. The

slope is calculated from the linear part of the log-log plot,

see Fig. 10. The slope of the regression curves tend to

saturate on the finite value of when is increased. In

the software, a default value of

was selected for the

embedding.

Recurrence plot analysis

Yet another approach, included in the software, for analyzing the complexity of the time series is the so-called recurrence plot (RP) analysis. In this approach, vectors

(32)

where is the embedding dimension and the embedding

lag. The vectors then represent the

interval time

series as a trajectory in dimensional space. A recurrence

plot is a symmetrical

matrix of zeros and ones. The element in the ‘th row and

‘th column of the RP matrix, i.e. RP( , ), is 1 if the point

on the trajectory is close to point . That is

(33)

where

is the Euclidean distance given in (29) and

is a fixed threshold. The structure of the RP matrix usually

shows short line segments of ones parallel to the main

diagonal. The lengths of these diagonal lines describe the

duration of which the two points are close to each other. An

example RP for HRV time series is presented in Fig. 11.

Methods for quantifying recurrence plots were proposed in

Webber et al. 1994. The methods included in this software are

introduced below.

software the following selections were made. The

embedding dimension and lag were selected to be

(default value) and

(fixed), respectively. The threshold

distance was selected to be

(default value), where SD is the standard deviation

of the RR time series. The selection are similar to those

made in Dabire et al 1998.

The first quantitative measure of RP is the recurrence rate

(REC) which is simply the ratio of ones and zeros in the RP

matrix. The number of elements in the RP matrix for

equal to

and the recurrence rate is simply given

as

(34)

The recurrence rate can also be calculated separately for each diagonal parallel to the line-of-identity (main diagonal). The trend of REC as a function of the time distance between these diagonals and the line-of-identity describes the fading of the recurrences for points further away. %This trend can be obtained by linear regression.

The rest of the RP measures consider the lengths of the

diagonal lines. A threshold

PNS and SNS indexes
Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity (vagal stimulation) is known to decrease heart rate and increase HRV. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity having the opposite effect on HR and HRV, i.e. it increases HR and decreases HRV. Therefore, HR is lowest and HRV is highest when we are in rest and fully recovered. During stressful situations when sympathetic nervous activity is increased, out HR is higher and HRV is smaller.
The PNS index in Kubios HRV software is computed based on Mean RR (ms), RMSSD (ms) and SD1 (%). Cardiac vagal activity is known to increase mean RR interval (i.e. decrease HR), thus Mean RR is a natural choice for the PNS index computation. In addition to mean heart rate, cardiac vagal activity affects HRV by regulating the magnitude of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)

component. The RSA is observed as quick changes in RR interval linked to respiration, i.e. decrease in RR during inhalation and increase in RR durSinavginegxthoalMatyioLnibra.ryIn timedomain these quick beat-to-beat changAbeosutinHRRVR interval can be best captured by the RMSSD paramSneapteshr,otwhich is why this parameter is the second input for the PNS index computation. In frequency-domain, the RSA component is typically observed as a peak within the high frequency (HF) band of the RR interval spectrum. This HF component is centered at the respiratory rate and its power is known to correlate strongly with the RMSSD. The power of the HF component in normalized units provides an alternative index for parasympathetic activity, and similarly, the low frequency (LF) component in normalized units (or the LF/HF ratio) has been widely used as an index of sympathetic activity or sympathovagal balance Task Force 1996. The problem with the HF component is that in case of spontaneous breathing, especially when the natural breathing rate of the subject is low (below 0.15 Hz or 9 breaths/min), the RSA component is partially, or even completely, overlaping with the LF component. Since Poincare plot index SD1 is known to be linked to RMSSD Brennan et al. 2001 and the ratio SD2/SD1 correlates with LF/HF ratio, the normalized SD1 value is used in Kubios HRV as the third input parameter for the PNS index computation.
The SNS index in Kubios HRV software is computed based on Mean HR (bpm), Baevsky’s stress index and SD2 (%). The mean HR is an evident choice, since the increase in HR is known to be linked to increased cardiac sympathetic activation. The Baevsky’s stress index is a rather widely used index of cardiovascular system stress and is strongly linked to sympathetic nervous activity. Finally, the normalized Poincare plot parameter SD2 provides a robust index of sympathovagal balance and is thus used as the third input parameter for SNS index computation.
During exercise cardiac vagal activity withdrawal followed by increased sympathetic activation takes place causing HR to increase as a function of exercise intensity. A curvilinear decrease in HRV shown both in time-domain and frequencydomain variables is observed during exercise and the minimum level of variability is typically reached at moderate to high intensity. RMSSD associated to parasympathetic activity typically reaches the minimum level already at moderate intensity (120-140 bpm, or 50-60% VO2max). The normalized LF power (or similarly SD2 (%)) typically increases during low-moderate intensity exercise and decresaes during higher intensity exercise, while normalized HF power (or SD1 (%)) shows the opposite exercise related response. In addition, a slight increase in HRV close to

maximum intensities have been observed in some studies,

but this might originate from non-neural mechanisms such

as direct mechanical effects of resSpairvaintigontoonMythLiebraSryA node.

Scott et al. 2017

About HRV

In conclusion, the PNS index is compuSnteadpshforot m Mean RR

(ms), RMSSD (ms) and SD1 (%); and SNS index is from

Mean HR (bpm), Baevsky’s stress index and SD2 (%). Each

parameter value is first compared to their normal population values as presented in Nunan et al. 2010. The normal values for

the SD1 and SD2 are derived based on their dependency on

the time-domain variables RMSSD and SDNN as described in Brennan et al. 2001. The normal values for the Baevsky’s stress index are taken from Baevsky 2009. The parameter

values are then scaled with the standard deviations of

normal population and finally a proprietary weighting is

applied to obtain robust and reliable PNS and SNS index

values. The known links between exercise intensity, heart

rate and HRV (as shortly described above) have also been

taken into account in the optimization of the weighs adopted

in PNS and SNS index computations.

Figure 12: PNS and SNS index computations.
The interpretation of the PNS and SNS indexes is straightforward. A PNS (or SNS) index value of zero means that the parameters reflecting parasympathetic (or sympathetic) activity are on average equal to the normal population average. Correspondingly, non-zero PNS index values describe how many SDs below (negative values) or above (positive values) the normal population average the parameter values are. Please note that the normal values presented in Nunan et al. 2010 are extracted from resting HRV measurements. Thus in rest, the PNS and SNS indexes are typically (with 95% of population) within -2…+2, i.e. within ±2SD of the normal population distribution (see Fig. 12). But during stress or during high intensity exercise much lower PNS index and much higher SNS index values can be observed.
Time-varying analysis
Time-varying analysis enables us to examine the changes occurring in RR interval time series as a function of time.

Time-varying trends for time-domain and nonlinear HRV parameters can be obtained by applying a moving window over the RR data. The window shSoauvilndgbteo lMoynLgibreanryough to provide accurate HRV analysis, but toAoboulotnHgRVwindow tends to over-smooth the changes in RR dataS.naApsghootod choice for the analysis window is 5-10 minutes when analyzing longer measurementsTask Force 1996. The window shift only affects on the time grid in which the time-varying analysis results are provided. In Kubios HRV software, both the window width and the shift can be defined by the user. The trends of the frequency-domain HRV parameters are computed based on a time-varying spectrum estimate. In Kubios HRV software, the time-varying spectrum is estimated either by using the short-time Fourier transformation (also known as spectrogram) method or by using a time-varying AR spectrum estimate. In the time-varying AR method, AR coefficients are estimated iteratively by using a Kalman smoother algorithm. The adaptation of the Kalman smoother algorithm can be adjusted, which affects on the resolution of the spectrum. For details on the Kalman smoother spectrum estimation see Tarvainen et al. 2006. An example of time-varying analysis of a 48-hour HRV recording is shown in Fig. 13.
Figure 13: An example of time-varying analysis of 48hour HRV recording; showing time-varying spectrum and EDR (top), and PNS and SNS index time trends (bottom).
The time-varying methods of Kubios HRV software include the trends of the time-domain measures , SDNN, , Min HR, Max HR, RMSSD, NNxx, pNNxx, HRV triangular index and TINN. For frequency-domain measures the trends are obtained for VLF, LF, and HF peak frequencies; VLF, LF, and HF band powers (both in ms and log-transformed); relative LF and HF band powers (both in \% and in n.u. units); and LF/HF ratio. Also the ECG derived respiration (EDR) is presented under frequency-domain parameters when ECG data is available. In addition, trends are calculated for the nonlinear measures Poincar{\e’} plot SD1, SD2 and SD2/SD1 ratio; approximate and sample entropies (ApEn and SampEn); detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) slopes and .
