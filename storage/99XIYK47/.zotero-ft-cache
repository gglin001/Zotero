abstract
The present meta-analysis aimed to quantify current evidence on sex differences in the autonomic control of the heart, indexed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in healthy human subjects. An extensive search of the literature yielded 2020 titles and abstracts, of which 172 provided sufﬁcient reporting of sex difference in HRV. Data from 63,612 participants (31,970 females) were available for analysis. Meta-analysis yielded a total of 1154 effect size estimates (k) across 50 different measures of HRV in a cumulated total of 296,247 participants. Females showed a signiﬁcantly lower mean RR interval and standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN). The power spectral density of HRV in females is characterized by signiﬁcantly less total power that contains signiﬁcantly greater high- (HF) and less low-frequency (LF) power. This is further reﬂected by a lower LF/HF ratio. Meta-regression revealed signiﬁcant effects of age, respiration control and the length of recording available for analysis. Although women showed greater mean heart rate, they showed greater vagal activity indexed by HF power of HRV. Underlying mechanisms of these ﬁndings are discussed.

1. Introduction

Two households, both alike in dignity (Shakespeare, 1914). Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). However, signiﬁcant health disparities exist between men and women such that men have earlier onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and greater CVD-related mortality and morbidity compared to women (Berry et al., 2012; Mikkola et al., 2013). Elevated resting heart rate (HR) is an independent risk factor for CVD (Cooney et al., 2010; Perret-Guillaume et al., 2009). However, despite greater resting HR, women don’t have an increased risk for CVD compared to men (Cordero and Alegria, 2006). Consequently, numerous studies have shown that HR does not have the same predictive power for mortality and morbidity in women as it does in men (Palatini, 2001; Sacha, 2014). Clearly additional research is necessary to understand this paradoxical situation.
Sex differences in the autonomic control of the heart, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), may potentially underlie these conﬂicting ﬁndings. The variability in the time series of adjacent heart beats provides insights into the interplay and contribution of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in regulating human HR. The HR is under tonic inhibitory control via parasympathetic inﬂuences (Jose and Collison, 1970; Levy, 1997).
Since the publication of the ﬁrst guidelines for the measurement and interpretation of HRV in 1996 (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996) thousands of studies utilizing measures of HRV have been published according to the PubMed database. HRV is widely recognized as a marker of cardiovascular health and overall mortality (Thayer et al., 2010). Despites its popularity and feasibility for research across different domains, several essential covariates of HRV remain to be systematically addressed. Here we investigate if HRV differs between men and women.
Numerous studies have explicitly addressed this question and were published on this topic, but yielded inconsistent ﬁndings. Some reported that the tonic vagal modulation of HR is augmented in women compared to men (Huikuri et al., 1996), others suggested, that “gender [. . .] might not strongly inﬂuence autonomic nervous system function” (Murata et al., 1992). However, to date, the existing literature on sex differences in HRV in healthy individuals has not been systematically quantiﬁed using meta-analysis.
We sought to rectify this situation by summarizing the available evidence using meta-analysis to quantify the effects across all studies reporting sex differences on measures of HRV in healthy human subjects.
2. Methods
2.1. Literature search
A systematic search of the literature, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al., 2009) was employed. PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), PsycINFO, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched for studies reporting sex differences in measures of HRV (see Appendix A, for search strategy by database). The number of initial hits was recorded. After removing duplicates, abstracts of all identiﬁed articles were screened based on pre-deﬁned inclusion criteria.
Abstracts were included and full-texts were retrieved if the abstract reported (i) an empirical investigation in (ii) healthy (iii) humans and (iii) if the full-text was published in the English language. Empirical investigations were deﬁned as studies

involving active data collection. Reviews, meta-analysis, comments, or single-case reports were excluded. Furthermore, dissertations, theses, as well as conference abstracts were excluded.
All studies reporting clinical samples of patients with any kind of disease or health-related distress were excluded. Studies were included if a clinical sample was reported in comparison to a group of healthy controls, of which only data from healthy controls was extracted for later analysis. Animal studies and studies published in any language other than English were excluded. The number of studies meeting the pre-deﬁned inclusion criteria, the number of studies excluded, and reasons for exclusion were recorded (Fig. 1). In case insufﬁcient information was provided in the abstract, the full-text of the title was screened.
All remaining studies were screened in full-text, given the likelihood that sex differences are not reported in the abstract but the full-text. Studies were included if the full-text reported

(i) sufﬁcient descriptive data (see below) of (ii) any given measure of HRV, (iii) separately for female and male participants. Studies reporting overlapping samples were excluded. In case overlapping samples were reported by multiple titles, the report published earlier was included. If overlapping samples reported different measures of HRV they were included in the meta-analysis for all measures other than those previously reported. A summary of HRV measures included and a brief description on their statistical basis is given in Table 1.
2.2. Data extraction and transformations
The name of the authors, the year of publication, the sample size studied the relative n of female and male subjects and the age of females and males respectively were retrieved from all included studies. Furthermore, information on several covariates was extracted for meta-regression (see below).
The basis for the calculation of all the HRV measures is the recording and analysis of the sequence of time intervals between adjacent heartbeats, the inter-beat interval (IBI in ms). Despite several methods to record the IBI sequence, electrocardiography (ECG) is the most prominent. Methods of operationalizing HRV fall broadly into three classes of measures: time-domain, frequencydomain and non-linear measures.
Time-domain indices are derived directly from the R-R interval series and generally measure the variability contained therein, by applying simple statistical computations, such as deriving the standard deviation (SD) of IBIs (SDNN) across a particular recording length for analysis.
Frequency-domain measures quantify power spectral density (PSD) within pre-speciﬁed frequency bands via spectral analytic techniques (i.e., Fast Fourier Transform or Autoregressive Algorithm). The power spectrum of short-term recordings usually contains three major components, a high- (HF: 0.15–0.40 Hz), a low- (LF: 0.01–0.15 Hz), and a very-low (VLF: < 0.04 Hz) frequency component. Given that the inﬂuence of the parasympathetic branch of the ANS in regulating HR produces rapid changes in the beat-to-beat timing of the heart (Uijtdehaage and Thayer, 2000), power in the

HF band and time-domain measures reﬂecting these fast changes (i.e., the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) are regarded as readily available indices of vagal activity. While the interpretation of activity in the LF band has generated a lively debate (Reyes del Paso et al., 2013; Goldstein et al., 2011), it is safe to consider, that it most likely reﬂects joint activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS.
For the present meta-analysis we included all measures of HRV reported, including time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear measures as well as some exotic indices derived from further computations (Table 1). Descriptive data on the reported measures were extracted for female and male subjects separately. Metaanalytical effect size estimates were based on means, standard deviations (SD) and the sample size (n). In case descriptive data was presented other than as mean and SDs, data transformations were applied. If the median (m) and the range with upper (a) and lower (b) limits were reported, the mean (x¯ ) was derived as proposed by Hozo et al. (2005), where x¯ = (a + 2m + b)/4.
For moderately sized samples (15 < n ≤ 70) the SD was derived by dividing the length of the range (b–a) by 4. For larger samples (n > 70), the length of the range was divided by 6. In case the female and male samples were unevenly weighted, the formula for the lower sized sample was used for both groups to avoid introducing error. If the interquartile range was reported the length of the range was divided by 1.35 (Wiebe et al., 2006). When only the standard error (SE) of the mean was reported, the SD was calculated by multiplying the SE by the square root of the sample size (Higgins and Green, 2011). In case the conﬁdence interval for the mean was given (i.e., 95%) the SD was derived by dividing the length of the conﬁdence interval by 3.92, and then multiplying by the square√root of the sample size (Higgins and Green, 2011), where SD = ( n × (b − a))/3.92. Different factors for different conﬁdence levels were applied (Higgins and Green, 2011).
Measures of PSD are frequently reported in different units. In addition to the raw values in ms2, normalized units (nu) are quite common. These reﬂect the relative portion of the selected frequency band in the total power of the PSD. While different methods are used to derive nu (i.e., the Italian formula, (e.g., LF/(TP-VLF)),

291

or the Japanese formula LF/TP), we combined reported values of nu irrespective of the formula used. Furthermore, time- and frequency domain measures of HRV are frequently skewed and authors apply a natural logarithmic (log) transformation to meet the assumptions of linear analysis (Ellis et al., 2008). These log transformed measures were extracted separately form ms2 and nu, with the exception of the LF/HF ratio, that always reﬂects a relative ratio of the LF and HF band, irrespective of previous data transformations, and thus was treated independent of the reported units.
If possible, only measures of resting baseline conditions were extracted. However, studies reporting long-term measures of HRV were also included, and the length of recording was later addressed as a potential covariate in meta-regression (see below). If studies reported measures of HRV that were further stratiﬁed by the time of recoding (e.g., day- vs. nighttime), age (e.g., young vs. middle-aged subjects), ethnicity (e.g., European Americans vs. African Americans) or other categorical variables (e.g., genotype), data was extracted for all sub groups and labeled respectively, as long as female and male subjects were compared under the same characteristic (i.e., African American Women vs. African American Men), and as long as multiple reporting of participants in the same recording segment could be avoided to prevent effect size inﬂation.
2.3. Meta-analysis
True effect estimates were computed as adjusted standardized mean differences (SMD, Hedge’s g) for all measures. We preferred using SMDs over mean differences (although we treated measures independently by the expression of units), given potential differences in the actual values reported that might relate to different techniques of handling or post-processing data. We undertook meta-analyses using both ﬁxed- and random-effect models and results from both models are presented. Generally speaking, we aimed to apply a conservative approach given the large number of effect estimates expected. We considered measures of HRV holding a true effect, if both (ﬁxed- and random-effect models) yielded signiﬁcant effects.
Heterogeneity or inconsistency among trials in the magnitude or direction of effects estimated was investigated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the standard I2 index, Chi2, and Tau2 tests (Higgins and Thompson, 2002). Bias was further examined using funnel plots from random-effect models, illustrating the effect size (SMD) against standard error for asymmetry. Meta-analytic computations were based on random-effects only and performed using RevMan (Version 5.3.4, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). With respect to the number of computations performed, forest- and funnel-plots are available on request.
2.4. Meta-regression
Four population- and study-level covariates were documented and the respective information was extracted and subjected to meta-regression. Among those were: (i) age (continuous), (ii) respiration (controlled vs. spontaneous), (iii) position at recording (supine vs. other), and (iv) the length of recording used for analysis (shortvs. long-term).
First, as HRV decreases with age (Yeragani et al., 1997), we aimed to control for such an effect by using the reported sample mean age as a continuous covariate. In case the mean age was reported separately for males and females, we estimated the sample mean. In case the median or range was reported, similar data transformations as described for estimating effect sizes were applied.
Next, the effect of controlling for respiration during the recording of HRV (i.e., ﬁxed breathing at a particular rate e.g., 0.25 Hz) was investigated. Similarly, we explored the effect of the participants’ position (i.e., seated, lying, standing) during the recording.

Finally, we controlled for the recording length by coding a categorical covariate, distinguishing short-term (<20 min) from long-term recordings (>1 h). The method of recording the IBI sequence (e.g., ECG, photoplethysmography) was also extracted from included studies. However, given that the majority of studies used ECG and insufﬁcient data were available on other methods, it was not subjected as a covariate for further meta-regression. All factorial covariates were dummy coded and transformed as a numerical expression (0 vs. 1). All meta-regression computations were performed using the OpenMetaAnalyst software (Wallace et al., 2012a, 2012b), and only HRV indices with at least 40 effect-size estimates (k ≥ 40) were subjected to meta-regression.

Sample and study characteristics of included studies are summarized in Table 2. Studies reported data in a total of 63,612 participants (31,970 females, 31,642 males).
3.2. Meta-analysis main effects
Data on all available measures of HRV were extracted from studies and entered intro RevMan for meta-analytical computations, yielding a total of 1154 effect size estimates (k) across 50 different measures of HRV in a cumulated total of 296,247 participants. Only results from analysis on 32 measures of HRV with k ≥ 3 are reported. Indices included in the analysis are described and explained in Table 2.
First, main effect estimates across all participants and age groups were derived using ﬁxed- and random-effect models. Here, only signiﬁcant ﬁndings that were consistent for ﬁxed- and random effect models are reported, providing statistics derived from random-effect models. Complete reporting of effect size estimates and test results for heterogeneity is provided in Table 3, and an illustrative summary for measures reported most frequently is given in Fig. 2.
Analysis of mean RR and time-domain measures of HRV revealed, that females show a decreased mean RR interval (g = −0.44; [95%CI: −0.54: −0.34], Z = 8.72, p < 0.0001, k = 79), SDNN independent of the reported units (in ms: g = −0.24; [95%CI: −0.30: −0.18], Z = 7.67, p < 0.0001, k = 99; log: g = −0.17; [95%CI: −0.25: −0.09], Z = 4.04, p < 0.0001, k = 16), and SDNNi (g = −0.44; [95%CI: −0.63: −0.26], Z = 4.70, p < 0.0001, k = 18) compared to males. Analysis on SDANN, MSD, RMSSD (ms and log-transformed), as well as NN50 and pNN50 yielded no signiﬁcant and inconsistent ﬁndings for both ﬁxed- and random-effect models (Table 3).
Meta-analysis on frequency-domain measures of PSD showed lower TP in females (in ms2: g = −0.19; [95%CI: −0.26: −0.12], Z = 5.02, p < 0.0001, k = 48; log: g = −0.23; [95%CI: −0.33: −0.12], Z = 4.23, p < 0.0001, k = 29). Furthermore, females showed decreased VLF power (in ms2: g = −0.21; [95%CI: −0.29: −0.13], Z = 4.92, p < 0.0001, k = 17; log: g = −0.21; [95%CI: −0.34: −0.07], Z = 3.04, p = 0.002, k = 19), and LF power (in ms2: g = −0.34; [95%CI: −0.45: −0.24], Z = 6.60, p < 0.0001, k = 82; log: g = −0.34; [95%CI: −0.43: −0.26], Z = 7.97, p < 0.0001, k = 50; nu: g = −0.38; [95%CI: −0.46: −0.31], Z = 9.86, p < 0.0001, k = 67).
Compared to males, females showed greater HF power (in ms2: g = 0.14; [95%CI: 0.05: 0.23], Z = 2.97, p = 0.003, k = 92; nu: g = 0.38; [95%CI: 0.29: 0.047], Z = 8.60, p < 0.0001, k = 67). Respectively, females showed a lower LF/HF ratio (g = −0.39; [95%CI: −0.47: −0.32], Z = 10.07, p < 0.0001, k = 92). VLF in nu and HF in log values, showed no signiﬁcant and consistent ﬁndings for both ﬁxedand random-effect models, although the direction of effects was in line with the ﬁndings reported for other units (see Table 3).
Furthermore, females showed a greater CCV-HF (g = 0.48; [95%CI: 0.20: 0.75], Z = 3.38, p < 0.0005, k = 3) and a greater CCVLF (g = 0.39; [95%CI: 0.09: 0.68], Z = 2.57, p = 0.01, k = 3). Non-linear measures of HRV only revealed consistent results across ﬁxedand random-effect models for SamEn and DFA␣1. Females showed greater SamEn (g = 0.67; [95%CI: 0.23: 1.10], Z = 3.02, p = 0.003, k = 4) and lower DFA␣1 (g = −0.17; [95%CI: −0.68: −0.22], Z = 3.87,

p < 0.0001, k = 5). However, all the later analyses are based on a relatively small number of available comparisons (k = 3–5).
CVRR (%), CVRR in log-transformed values, SD1 and SD2, as well as ApEn and TI showed no signiﬁcant and consistent ﬁndings for both ﬁxed- and random-effect models (Table 3). Most of the analysis on included measures of HRV, revealed signiﬁcant heterogeneity across studies (Table 3)
3.3. Meta-regression
Meta-regression on random-effects was performed for RR, SDNN (ms), RMSSD (ms), pNN50 (%), TP (ms2), LF (ms2, nu, log), HF (ms2, nu, log), and LF/HF. Here, only signiﬁcant effects are reported. Full reporting is provided in Table 4. Meta-regression on time-domain measures of HRV with age (continuous) as a covariate, revealed small, but signiﬁcant effects on SDNN (in ms; ˇ = 0.005, [95%CI: 0.001: 0.008], SE = 0.002, p = 0.017, k = 99) and RMSSD (in ms; ˇ = 0.005, [95%CI: 0.002: 0.008], SE = 0.002, p < 0.001, k = 82). With greater age, the previously reported sex differences on SDDN (lower in females, Fig. 2) were diminished. While metaanalysis on RMSSD (ms) showed no consistent effects (Fig. 2), females showed greater RMSSD compared to males with increasing age. Meta-regression on frequency-domain measures showed that with increasing age, the previously reported effect for LF (nu) power (lower in females) was further increased (ˇ = −0.006, [95%CI: −0.011: −0.002], SE = 0.002, p = 0.004, k = 67).
Controlling for respiration (controlled vs. spontaneous) was a signiﬁcant covariate for LF (nu) (controlled k = 5; spontaneous k = 15; ˇ = 0.309, [95%CI: 0.076: 0.541], SE = 0.118, p = 0.009) and HF (log) (controlled k = 15; spontaneous k = 25; ␤ = −0.264, [95%CI: −0.448: −0.080], SE = 0.094, p = 0.005). The reported main effects for LF (nu) (lower in females) and HF (log) (greater in females), were attenuated during spontaneous breathing. However, meta-regression on estimates of PSD expressed in other units didn’t show such effect. Meta-regression on respiration control showed no significant effects for time-domain measures of HRV. Meta-regression on position at recording showed no effects on any of the included measures of HRV (Table 4).
Meta-regression on the length of recording (short vs. long) available for analysis of HRV, showed signiﬁcant effects on SDNN (ms), RMSSD (ms), pNN50 (%) and TP (ms2). Sex differences on SDNN (lower in females, Fig. 2) were further enhanced in long-term recordings (short k = 55; long k = 39; ˇ = −0.320, [95%CI: −0.433: −0.206], SE = 0.058, p < 0.001). Similarly, lower TP in females (independent of recording length) was shown in particular in long-term recordings (short k = 37; long k = 9; ˇ = −0.267, [95%CI: −0.419: −0.123], SE = 0.073, p < 0.001). RMSSD (short k = 39; long k = 36; ˇ = −0.122, [95%CI: −0.229: −0.015], SE = 0.054, p = 0.025) and pNN50 (short k = 18; long k = 27; ˇ = −0.285, [95%CI: −0.419: −0.150], SE = 0.069, p < 0.001), were lower in females during longterm recordings.
4. Discussion
This is the ﬁrst meta-analysis on sex differences in HRV. In line with previous ﬁndings, we show that females have a greater mean HR reﬂected by a smaller mean RR interval. Females show less variability within the time-series of heartbeats indexed by SDNN and SDNNi—in particular in long-term recordings. Meta-analysis on frequency-domain measures of HRV showed that females have lower total power in the spectral density. Importantly, the composition of the PSD signiﬁcantly differs between males and females. While females show less power in the very-low and LF bands they show greater power in the HF band. Consistent with a large body of animal and human research (Dart et al., 2002; Du et al., 2006),

these ﬁndings indicate that the autonomic control of the female heart is characterized by a relative dominance of vagal, parasympathetic activity, despite greater mean HR, whereas the male heart is characterized by relative sympathetic dominance, despite lower HR. These ﬁndings have several important implications.
Altered function of the ANS, characterized by autonomic imbalance (i.e., relatively high sympathetic activity and relatively low parasympathetic activity) is one posited mechanism underlying the increased risk for adverse somatic health outcomes, such as CVD, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke as well as all-cause mortality (Thayer et al., 2010; Thayer and Lane, 2007). Greater vagal activity

is considered to be cardio-protective and is associated with overall greater self-reported health (Jarczok et al., 2015), wellbeing and longevity.
One easily obtainable, albeit crude, index of autonomic imbalance is resting HR. Numerous studies have shown that higher resting HR is associated with increased mortality and morbidity (Palatini and Julius, 1997; Palatini and Julius, 2014; Palatini and Julius, 1999; Palatini and Julius, 2009). Given that the present results found shorter RR intervals (higher resting HR) in women one might expect that women would have greater CVD related mortality and morbidity. However, this is not the case as women

305

have longer life expectancies and reduced CVD risk (at least premenopausal) (Matthews et al., 2001). In addition, it has been reported that the association between tachycardia or elevated HR and cardiovascular disease risk is stronger in men than in women (Palatini, 2001). Thus this paradoxical state of affairs requires explanation.
Our ﬁndings highlight that women show greater vagal activity compared to men, providing a potential mechanism underlying the health disparity between the sexes. Most interestingly, although women show greater parasympathetic activity, they show a decreased mean RR interval compared to men and less total variability in the time-series of heartbeats. Although a complete explication of the potential mechanisms by which females come to have greater parasympathetic cardiac control is beyond the scope of the present paper, as several reviews have summarized much of this literature (Dart et al., 2002; Du et al., 2006), we will brieﬂy outline a few of those previously suggested and propose some others.
Both animal and human studies have reported sex differences in autonomic control such that females show greater parasympathetic modulation of cardiovascular activity compared to males. For example, in response to coronary artery occlusion both rodent and human females show greater vagally-mediated cardioprotective responses such as bradycardia, increased HRV, and simultaneous bradycardia and decreased blood pressure (Bezold-Jarisch type reactions (Aviado and Guevara Aviado, 2001; Mark, 1983)) compared to males (Airaksinen et al., 1998; Du et al., 1995). Research has suggested that this is due to the effects of estrogen as ovareictomy and vagotomy in females reversed these effects and produced more “male-like” responses (Du et al., 2006).
In addition, oxytocin has been implicated as stimulation of oxytocin neurons has been shown to induce HR slowing (bradycardia) and increased vagal tone (Rogers and Hermann, 1986; Higa et al., 2002). Importantly, it has been shown that these oxytocin neurons are associated with stress buffering in that they are more active during stressful events and thus serve to reduce the impact of such events by lowering HR via increased vagal tone (Higa et al., 2002). Further elaboration of the exact central nervous system (CNS) pathways via which oxytocin produces its stress buffering effects comes from animal studies. Oxytocin-type neurons from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) have been shown to synapse on cardiovagal neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX), and the nucleus ambiguus (NA) (Higa et al., 2002; Luiten et al., 1985; Coote, 2013). Excitation of these neurons increase vagal outﬂow and decrease HR while having no effect on sympathetic outﬂow (Higa et al., 2002). Furthermore, both human and animal studies suggest that the amygdala plays a decisive role in the CNS stress attenuating effects of oxytocin (Landgraf and Neumann, 2004; Kirsch et al., 2005; Viviani et al., 2011).
Finally, neural control of the heart may differ signiﬁcantly as a function of sex. HRV is related to brain structures such as the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Thayer et al., 2012). For example, we have shown that amygdala activity is positively associated with HRV in women but negatively associated with HRV in men (Nugent et al., 2011). Furthermore, resting HFHRV is related to resting brain perfusion (Allen et al., 2015c). Of note, higher resting HF-HRV was related to less perfusion in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left amygdala, and the right hippocampus in women but not men (Allen et al., 2015b). Most interestingly, a recent meta-analysis on sex differences in brain structure showed regional sex differences in volume and tissue density in the amygdala, hippocampus and insula (Ruigrok et al., 2014). Taken together these effects of estrogen, oxytocin, and neural control are consistent with models of parental investment and differential stress coping as exempliﬁed in the tend-and-befriend model to provide a functional basis for these structural physiological differences (Taylor et al., 2000).

Of the major limitations of the present analysis is the fact that a large amount of studies had to be excluded because of insufﬁcient reporting of descriptive data (Fig. 1). Given the exclusion of these studies with potential data of interest, the present analysis is not completely reﬂective of the existing evidence. While not all studies which were excluded for not reporting results separately for men and women, did also not control for sex differences (i.e., in adjusted analysis), our ﬁndings highlight the necessity of adequate reporting of sex differences in the literature. Researchers are encouraged to provide descriptive statistics for HRV in women and men to further add to the existing body of literature. Furthermore, we think that sex differences in HRV should be critically noted within an update of the guidelines for the measurement and interpretation of HRV (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996)—in particular for the measurement of long-term recordings. This ﬁnal recommendation is consistent with recent guidelines from the US National Institutes of Health on the inclusion of females in both basic and clinical research.
While our analyses provide solid evidence for the general existence of sex difference in HRV, we didn’t control for some covariates that need to be considered in future analyses. It has repeatedly been shown, that HRV is related to body composition, using measures of body mass index (Koenig et al., 2014), waist-to-height ratio, or waist-circumference (Windham et al., 2012). Furthermore, HRV is strongly related to physical activity (Rennie et al., 2003), which was rarely reported in the included studies and thus couldn’t be controlled for in our analysis.
From a methodological perspective we didn’t address the inﬂuence of the method of PSD estimation (i.e., Autoregressive vs. Fast-Fourier), sample rate of recording, and there was insufﬁcient data to compare different methods of recording HRV (e.g., photoplethysmography vs. ECG). Other confounds such as electrode placement, post-processing of data and the use of different software tools for analysis of HRV were beyond the scope of the present paper and not addressed. Furthermore, the present analysis didn’t address the inﬂuence of other variables that have been identiﬁed by previous meta-analysis such as ethnicity (Hill et al., 2015) that has been shown to account for individual differences in HRV.
However, to our knowledge the present meta-analysis is the most extensive meta-analysis on HRV ever performed, providing further potential to derive estimates of norm-values in the general healthy population. Again, here we only focused on sex-differences. To summarize, we provide compelling evidence, that HRV data obtained in men and women cannot be treated equally and that studies need to emphasize these differences. Furthermore, our analyses show that differences in the autonomic regulation of mean HR are complex. Measures of mean HR alone cannot replace measures of HRV in understanding important health disparities. Most importantly, despite greater mean HR the female heart is characterized by a relative dominance of vagal, parasympathetic activity. Thus, mean HR alone provides limited insight into CVD risk—in particular in females. Research on HRV needs to emphasize and report sex differences in healthy samples. Further research on how these sex differences translate into pathological processes is desperately needed.
