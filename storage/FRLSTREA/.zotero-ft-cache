1 Introduction
The heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation in consecutive RR intervals extracted noninvasively from electrocardiogram (ECG) signal [1]. The traditional way of clearly discriminating healthy and nonhealthy cases solely by morphological features of ECG alone is bit hectic and may not be precise, since the subtle variations are partially unobservable. In such circumstances the HRV analysis plays a vital role in finding the variations existing in the ECG signal. HRV is extensively used to evaluate the activity of the cardiovascular system as well as autonomic nervous system. HRV has always been a subject of active research in biomedical community. During, hypertension (HTN) the arteries consistently remain in elevated blood pressure (BP), generally exceeding 140/90 mm Hg. High BP damages critical organs of human body without showing any significant symptoms [2]. The coronary artery disease (CAD) which is characterized by blockage or narrowing of coronary arteries is a major cardiovascular disorder. During CAD, the plaque and cholesterol gets deposited on the inside walls of the arteries [3]. As, CAD is asymptomatic therefore early detection is essential to avoid development of ischemia and myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, there is a significant impetus in the research community to develop low cost noninvasive technique for early diagnosis of CAD which results in high morbidity and mortality [4]. Standard guidelines for HRV analysis are well summarized by different techniques [5]. Many researchers provide the basic literature that includes measures and models [6],

physiological origins and mechanisms of heart rate [7]. For the analysis of HRV time series data different techniques have been proposed that include statistical time domain (TD) methods [1, 2, 5–7], frequency domain (FD) methods [1, 2, 5–10] based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) or autoregressive (AR) modeling and several nonlinear techniques [9–15]. Literature provides the wide range of factors that influence the HRV signal, majorly considered are age group, gender, habits, race, religion, in healthy volunteers [16–19] and also diseased patients such as HTN [20, 21], CAD [22, 23], diabetes mellitus [24], cardiac arrhythmia [25–28], fibrillation [29], MI [30], and so on. In the recent years, many researchers utilized the computed features by different methods for binary classification tasks to classify diseased patients by comparing with normal subjects. Poddar et al. [20, 21] used linear and nonlinear methods to analyze the HRV for differential diagnosis between normal and hypertensive patients using SVM classification technique. Acharya et al. [22] proposed a technique to differentiate between normal and CAD affected patients by using linear and nonlinear methods for analyzing the heart rate from ECG signals. Giri et al. [23] proposed a method to differentiate between the normal and CAD conditions using heart rate signals using wavelet transform and different dimension reduction techniques. In another study, Acharya et al. [24] proposed a method to determine the cardiac health of normal and diabetic patients using nonlinear methods for HRV analysis. However, to a certain extent, multi classification has also been carried out by different studies to classify the different diseases by comparing with normal subjects [25, 28, 31–35]. Tsipouras and Fotiadis [25] proposed a method for arrhythmia detection in time and time-frequency domain. Babak et al. [28] proposed a method to discriminate between six different types of arrhythmia classes using HRV signals based on linear and nonlinear methods. Acharya et al. [31] proposed a method to classify four different types of cardiac disorders using heart rate data and artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. Acharya et al. [32] proposed a method to classify different cardiac rhythms using ANN and fuzzy logic on heart rate signals.
In the present work, attempt has been made to develop computer aided classification system for differential diagnosis between HTN, and CAD affected patients with normal subjects using features derived using linear and nonlinear methods with various classifiers.
2 Materials and Methods
The evolution of computer technology, image processing algorithms and different artificial intelligence as well as data mining and machine learning techniques has provided ample opportunities to various researchers for investigating the potential of computer aided classification systems for characterization and analysis of different medical conditions using the medical images or signals captured using various modalities [33–44]. The characterization refers to quantitative analysis of different features (extracted from the captured data) using computer based algorithms resulting in accurate distinction between normal and abnormal conditions of the data under study.

2.1 Data Collection and Processing
The protocol followed for data collection and processing in the present work is represented in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1 it has been seen that the number of NOR subjects chosen was 20, hence an equal number of data in each group was considered for the analysis and classification purposes. The general block diagram of computer aided classification system indicating the different stages involved in HRV analysis is shown in Fig. 2.

The BIOPAC system with Acknowledge 4.0 software has been used for obtaining the RR tachogram which contains unevenly placed samples as the RR interval varying from one beat to another. To maintain the uniformity among the entire length of tachogram data, tachogram signal has been sampled again at a frequency of 4 Hz [45–47]. The obtained RR interval tachogram signal in text format has been used further for HRV analysis.
2.2 HRV Analysis For HRV analysis different linear and nonlinear methods are employed. Using these methods different indices can be computed that are used as features in differentiating between the NOR, HTN, and CAD subjects. The different methods and computed indices are represented in Fig. 3. For details of the computed features refer [17, 25, 26, 48–54].

Automated Classification of Hypertension and Coronary Artery Disease Patients 103 2.3 Classification Module In the present work, popular classifiers namely probabilistic neural network (PNN), K nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been used after normalizing the training and testing data with min-max normalization procedure. 2.3.1 Probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier The operation of a PNN classifier is organized in the form of a multilayered feed forward network. The steps followed in the classification task are shown in Fig. 4. For further details refer [36, 55]. 2.3.2 K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier This classifier identifies the class of an unknown instance based on the majority voting of its nearest neighbors. The instances are categorized into disjoint sets based on the assumption that instances of feature vector that are near each other in feature space represent instances that belong to the same class. The nearest neighbors of the unknown instance are decided on the basis of a distance metric [36]. The different distance metrics available are: Euclidean, City block, Cosine, Correlation, Hamming, and so on. In the present study, Euclidean distance is

used as the distance metric. The optimal value of K is determined by performing repeated experiments with K E {1, 2, …, 9}. The steps followed for the classification task are shown in Fig. 5. 2.3.3 Support vector machine (SVM) classifier In this classifier, the instances are separated into disjoint classes in feature space using a hyper-plane that maximizes the margin between two classes [37–39]. The SVM classifier has been implemented using LibSVM library [56]. The nonlinear data has been mapped to the higher dimensionality feature space using Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) kernel. The steps followed in the classification task are shown in Fig. 6. For further details refer [28, 57–60].

The HRmean in all three cases is clearly distinguishable that NOR subjects have the lesser HRmean as compared to both HTN and CAD patients. The HTN group has the highest value of HRmean than other groups. The parameter variance is much lesser in HTN patients than both NOR subjects and CAD patients and also the NOR case has the highest variance than HTN and CAD patients. In the same way, other features such as SDNN, SDSD, RMSSD, CV%, and pNN50 have higher values for the NOR class as it shows more variability in the HR than HTN and CAD patient groups. Results obtained from analysis of HRV features calculated from FD by FFT and AR methods with three groups of the data are compared in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.
The FD features P-VLF, P-LF, P-HF, and LF/HF from both FFT and AR are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 respectively. Spectral domain features calculated from parametric method by FFT and nonparametric method by AR modeling indicate similar trend for all the features. Slight variations have been noted in absolute values because of the difference in methodology. Power in all frequency ranges and entire range was calculated by PSD in ms2 by both parametric and nonparametric methods and ratio of LF to HF was also calculated.
The general trend is that power in all three groups goes on decrementing from VLF to LF and LF to HF which is the natural tendency of spectral analysis. The power in NOR group is higher in all the frequency ranges and entire range as compared to patients groups of HTN and CAD. HTN patient group has the lower values of power in the said ranges than other two groups. However, LF/HF has inverse effects which is lower in

NOR case and higher in HTN group than remaining two groups as it is a ratio and signifies sympathovagal balance.
A comparative analysis of features by nonlinear method from all three groups of NOR, HTN and CAD are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 10.
Higher PP values of SD1 and SD2 indicate that more spread of data points is exhibited in the elliptic structure for NOR subjects in comparison with HTN and CAD patients. However, HTN has lower values of SD1 and SD2 than NOR group and CAD patients. In NOR group, the values of ApEn and SampEn are noted to be marginally higher as compared to HTN and CAD patients CAD patents are having the lesser values of ApEn and SampEn than controlled group.
A multiclass classification is carried out after the analysis of HRV on three different classes using PNN, KNN, and SVM classifiers. Equal number of data was used for training and testing to maintain the uniformity for the classification testing. Total 21 features were included for classification, seven features from TD, five features each from FD by FFT and AR methods and four features from nonlinear method, Classification was carried out individually on features of TD, FD by FFT, FD by AR, nonlinear methods and all features combined altogether. Classification results obtained from TD features are presented in Table 5 and graphically represented in Fig. 11.
It can be observed from Table 5 that the PNN classifier achieves highest classification accuracy of 90.0%, greater than both KNN and SVM classifiers. The number of misclassified cases in testing instances encountered was 3/30.
Classification results obtained from FD features by FFT are shown in Table 6 and graphically represented in Fig. 12 while Table 7 and Fig. 13 represent the classification results obtained from FD features by AR.
It can be observed from Tables 6 and 7, in FD methods, KNN classifier works better than PNN and SVM classifiers in case of both FFT method and AR method. Also the FFT method has better classification accuracy than AR method. In case of FFT method, the accuracy achieved was 83.33% with the number of misclassified instances equal to 5/30. In

case of ARV method, the accuracy achieved was 76.67% with the number of misclassified instances equal to 7/30.
The classification results obtained using features extracted by nonlinear method are shown in Table 8 and graphically represented in Fig. 14.
It is observed from Table 8 that PNN classifier achieves highest classification accuracy of 83.33% with the number of misclassified instances equal to 5/30.
Classification results of all features obtained from linear and nonlinear methods are presented in Table 9 and graphically represented in Fig. 15.
It can be observed that the SVM classifier performs better than both PNN and KNN classifiers in differentiating between NOR, HTN, and CAD cases. The peculiar results can be observed when classification of features involving individual methods has the lower values of accuracy than the combined features altogether in all the three classifiers which signify the importance of features altogether rather than the individual features category.
Using the different features extracted from the HRV signals, an attempt has been made to discriminate between normal subjects and hypertensive and CAD affected patients. The extracted features explore different properties of the HRV thus achieving different accuracies in each case. From the exhaustive experiments carried out in the present work, it has been observed that the features computed from the HRV signals using different linear and nonlinear methods when combined together result in better differential diagnosis between normal, hypertensive and CAD affected patients as compared to individual feature sets. The SVM classifier classifies the time domain, frequency domain by FFT, frequency domain by AR and nonlinear features with an accuracy of 70.0%, 80.0%, 60.0%, and 53.33%, respectively, but when all features are considered together, an accuracy of 96.67% is achieved

4 Conclusion
The CAD and HTN diseases are the main cardiac problems which are asymptomatic and have high morbidity and mortality. For better prognosis of these conditions, an early diagnosis is of utmost importance. An efficient classification system has been designed in the present work using relevant features derived from HRV signal. The results show that the analysis of the variation in RR interval of time series data hold significant promise for capturing the information required for differential diagnosis between patients affected with HTN and CAD with the normal healthy subjects.
Hence it can be concluded that the proposed computer aided classification system can be used as an additional diagnostic tool in routine clinical practice to effectively differentiate between the normal subjects and HTN and CAD affected patients.
The present work can be extended by using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for the differential diagnosis between normal, hypertensive and CAD affected patients.
