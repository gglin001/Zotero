1. Introduction

As the worldwide trend of aging population has increased in recent years, an increase in lifestyle diseases has occurred such as heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes [1]. Diabetes mellitus, a lifestyle-related disease, is said to increase the risk of developing dementia. For this reason, these diseases not only threaten health and longevity; they stand to raise national healthcare costs considerably. Early detection of cardiac and lifestyle diseases is necessary, but improving lifestyle habits is also important for disease prevention and for healthy life span extension. Wearable health care devices capable of routinely monitoring biological signals are expected to play an increasingly important role in meeting that social objective.
The heart beat is a biological signal used for cardiac disease detection, heart rate variability analysis [2], and exercise intensity estimation [3]. For measurements, an electrocardiograph (ECG) and a photoplethysmograph (PPG) are used. Furthermore, increased physical activity is particularly eﬀective for lifestyle disease prevention. Triaxial acceleration data and other data are used to monitor physical activity in daily life. As presented in Fig. 1, improvement of a healthy lifestyle entails measurement of one’s own lifestyle, accumulation and analysis of data, and feedback about one’s own lifestyle based on those results. It is important to keep this cycle [4]. To make full use of the cycle eﬀects, measured data must be obtained continually over a long period. Required speciﬁcations for digital health system devices (Fig. 2) are a long operating time, high noise tolerance, wearable size, and reasonable cost. To ful-

biomedical processor SoC consisting of a sensor front-end, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a general purpose processor core, memory, a DSP accelerator, RF circuits, and a power management circuit. Some of those components might not be integrated on the chip. Generally, a highperformance analog front-end circuit must be used to prevent the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) degradation. Unfortunately, an analog circuit has large circuit area and high power consumption. Therefore, using high-performance ampliﬁers and high-quality analog ﬁlters is diﬃcult. In accordance with Moore’s Law, the power of digital components decreases as process technology advances. In contrast, the power consumption of analog circuit does not decrease concomitantly. Therefore, weight is shifting to digital signal processing aimed at reducing the performance requirements of analog parts and minimizing the power consumption of the whole system. For further low-power implementation, hybrid architectures that use hardware accelerators to support software processing in microcomputers are the mainstream architectures in digital signal processing. Technology nodes with 180 nm to 130 nm processes have often been used: they provide suﬃciently small leakage current. Table 1 summarizes several SoCs developed earlier for digital health applications [13]–[27].
The most important design issue is the operating time.

Low power characteristics are indispensable for long daily continuous measurements under a ﬁnite battery lifetime. Even small batteries that realize wearable size must provide resources for long-term operation. The ultimate target of low power design is to guarantee continued operation in an autonomous energy supply environment by environmental power generation with an energy harvester using a heat source [10], [11], [28] and vibration [29]. The energy consumption of the entire sensor system node must be less than the environmental power generation energy. Figure 4 shows the annual trend of the power consumption characteristics of the developed SoCs summarized in Table 1, together with the power energy obtained by various environmental power generation. Power reduction in developed SoCs is progressing to a level where operation by some environmental power generation is possible, but in order to put it into practical use, the sensor node itself must be able to deal with the ﬂuctuation of the generated power in environmental power generation [16].
Another important issue related to wearable sensors is high-accuracy design. Techniques can improve the signal level by improving noise tolerance characteristics [79]. A major noise that deteriorates the SNR of ECG or other

signals is motion artifacts caused by skin stretching, pressure, and deformation. Those are about ten times as strong as the ECG signal, severely aﬀecting the system operation. The other technique is a high-accuracy heartbeat and heartbeat variation estimation technique using diﬀerent modalities [25], [26].
Wearable size is also an important issue. Interelectrode distance minimization and battery miniaturization for biological information data measurement are eﬀective for realizing a wearable sensor size. However, the former reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and degrades the measurement accuracy. ECG measures the potential diﬀerence on the body surface attributable to the electrical activity of the heart. The potential diﬀerence is decreased when the electrode distance is reduced. Thus, the SNR of ECG is aﬀected by the electrode distance. The latter also presents a diﬃculty: the operation time can not be lengthened. Technology developments that resolve tradeoﬀs among miniaturization, accuracy, and operation time are proceeding in several lines of research.
3. Biosignal
Signals used to ascertain health parameters include Electrocardiagram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), Acceleration, and Electrodermal activity (EDA) including galvanic skin response (GSR) and bioimpedance (BIO-Z). ECG is used for heart rate analysis and cardiac activity measurement. EDA represents the stress level and skin activity.
3.1 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An electrocardiograph [30]–[32] measures the potential difference on the body surface attributable to the electrical activity of the heart. The electrocardiogram records temporal changes in the action potential of the heart: generally P, Q, R, S, and T waves (Fig. 5). The P wave results from excitation of the atrium muscle, the Q, R, S waves respectively reﬂect the excitement of the ventricular muscles. The T wave shows their recovery disappearance. The number of R wave appearences during a given time is designated as the average heart rate (AHR). The time from the R wave to the next R wave is called the RR interval (RRI). The reciprocal of the RR interval is the instantaneous heart rate (IHR). Heart rate variability represents a spectrum analysis of IHR and reﬂects the heart rate ﬂuctuation [5].
3.2 Photoplethysmogram (PPG)
A PPG sensor is commonly used in recent wearable devices to detect cardiovascular information including the heartbeat. The PPG sensor irradiates green light to the body surface and measures the amount of light absorption by hemoglobin related to the volume change of blood vessels [33] (Fig. 6). However, pulse wave signal measurement consumes large amounts of power because PPG requires one or more LEDs and a photodiode to measure the reﬂected light. Because the

battery capacity of the wearable device is strictly limited, the power consumption should be reduced to realize an easy-touse daily life monitoring system.
A trans-impedance ampliﬁer (TIA, Fig. 7) is commonly used in recent PPG sensors [26], [34], [35]. The TIA converts the minute current Iin generated by a photodiode into a voltage with transimpedance R f . The ampliﬁed output voltage of this circuit Vo is expressed as shown below.
Vo = R f ∗ Iin
Actually, C f in Fig. 7, which is indispensable for negative feedback stability, is calculated as shown below [36].

gain. Pulse oximetry (SpO 2) sensor consists of similar measurement circuits. Cuﬀ-less blood pressure measurement using PPG is a hot topic.
3.3 Acceleration
A triaxial accelerometer is used to monitor physical activity and thereby elucidate lifestyle habits (Fig. 8). For example, a physical activity classiﬁcation algorithm [37], [38] uses two indices calculated using triaxial acceleration. Values of metabolic equivalents (METs) [39] have been used widely as indicators to quantify physical activity intensity. The METs value is the amount of oxygen consumed at rest. The amount of oxygen uptake at rest must be measured to obtain an accurate METs value. However, the method of gathering exhaled gases is too stressful to continue measurements over long periods. Therefore, a method of estimating METs values using a triaxial acceleration has been developed as a less burdensome measurement method.
3.4 Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
Electrodermal activity (EDA) [40], which reﬂects the electrical properties of human skin, is aﬀected by perspiration. The signal is useful for quantifying autonomic nerve responses as a parameter of sweat gland function. Two EDA measurement approaches are used: exosomatic and endosomatic. Exosomatic techniques examine the apparent resistance change on the skin by application of a weak current between the electrodes. By contrast endosomatic techniques measure the potential between one electrode pair on the skin.
A galvanic skin response (GSR) is a generic name for a skin potential response (SPR), a skin resistance change (SRC), and a skin conductance change (SCC). Actually, EDA is a more general term than GSR. For wearable sensors, GSR is often used.
The bio-impedance (Bio-Z) is the electrical impedance of body tissues. The Bio-Z can be used to measure the amounts of body ﬂuids.

4. Low-Power Design
4.1 Communication Power Reduction
An RF circuit used for wireless communication is an important wearable sensor component. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Zig-Bee, and Body Area Network (BAN) are candidate wireless communication standards for wearable biomedical sensors [10]. Many power reduction methods have been proposed for them. Nevertheless, it is diﬃcult to reduce the transmission and receiving energy drastically for one-bit information. In contrast, the transmitted data size reduction is more eﬀective for system-level power reduction. On-node processing is a modern approach to reduce the node data using data compression or feature extraction.
4.1.1 Compressed Sensing
The most straightforward way to reduce the transmitted data amount is data compression. Many data compression algorithms have been proposed. Compressed sensing [41] is especially attracting attention as a compression technique used for biosensing.
Compressed sensing assumes that the measured signal is sparse with low-rank. This algorithm recovers the sparse vector x from measured vector y. The known measured vector y can be expressed as
y = Φx,
where x ∈ Rn is the original sparse signal and Φ ∈ Rm×n (m < n) is a random measurement matrix. Then, compressed signal y has smaller order m than the original signal order n. Therefore, the transmitted data amount can be reduced. The process of reconstruction from y to x can be implemented in a base station (Fig. 9).
Dedicated hardware and sensing circuits have been proposed [42]–[46]. According to this theory, one reported PPG-sensing SoC [27] reduces the sampling rate. For example, 10 times compressed ratio can be achieved for ECG measurement with 2-bpm error as shown in Ref. [27].
4.1.2 Spectral Analysis
When the application layer only requires frequency features, one can reduce the data transmission amount using frequency analysis of the node.
Spectral analysis is used widely for digital signal processing for time series data such as vital signal and speech analysis. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is used widely for spectral analysis because the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm obtains an accurate spectrum with few calculations. Moreover, it can be implemented easily using dedicated hardware because most calculations are simply multiplication and accumulation.
However, the DFT frequency resolution depends on

the sampling rate and the number of input data. More input points must be used to obtain higher frequency resolution. In some actual applications, the data length cannot be increased. Frequency characteristics must be extracted instantaneously from measured data, for instance, for biological signal measurements that require real-time data analysis. The short data length also reduces the processor and memory power consumption.
An autoregressive (AR) model can realize accurate and low-power spectral analysis with short data length. The AR model is a linear predictive modeling technique that assumes that the current value of a signal can be described by a ﬁnite linear aggregate of the preceding values. As an alternative to the Fourier transform, the AR model is useful for spectral analysis [47]. In this method, time series data are input and a speciﬁc linear system, the AR model, is output. Subsequently, the frequency spectrum is obtained by comparing the AR model with the variance of white noise. Using this method, the frequency resolution can be ascertained arbitrarily. This parametric method can yield higher resolutions than nonparametric methods such as DFT in cases with short data length.
However, the AR-model-based spectral analysis requires a larger number of calculations than FFT does, especially with the higher model order. An eﬃcient hardware design of the AR model estimation has been studied [48]. Figure 10 shows the signal processing ﬂow of the hardware-implemented fast Burg’s method [49]. The calculation process is mainly divided into two stages. One is the stage of calculating autocorrelations (AC stage). The calculation of this stage increases in proportion to the input data length. Another is a stage to estimate AR model (AR stage). Figure 11 shows dedicated hardware for Fast Burg’s method. Here, the AR order is a model order, which

determines the complexity of expressible models. A higher AR order increases the computational amounts. As presented in Fig. 12, the implemented hardware can achieve almost identical FoM [51] compared to state-of-the-art FFT hardware [50]–[52].
FoM = Normalized Energy Execution

By transmitting only the AR coeﬃcients, it is possible to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted as compared with the case of transmitting the spectrogram calculated by FFT. Assuming application to heart rate variability analysis, if the data length is 256 and AR - order is 64, the data amount is reduced to almost half. This is because the reduction rate is almost AR order/128. In that case, the accuracy deterioration is 1% or less.

4.1.3 Feature Extraction

Even when an application uses a feature in the time-domain, the transmitted data amount can be reduced by on-node feature extraction. For example, in an arrhythmia detection application from ECG, the wave form and heartbeat interval variation have important features. One earlier report [19] proposed an on-node PQRST wave extraction method. The extracted PQRST components are useful for determining QT distance and T wave height for arrhythmia detection.
Cuﬀ-less blood pressure monitoring methods using ECG and PPG waveforms have also been proposed [53]– [56]. ECG measures the potential diﬀerence on the body surface attributable to electrical activity of the heart. By contrast, a PPG sensor irradiates green or red light to the body surface and measures the amount of light absorption by hemoglobin related to the blood vessel volume change. Therefore, several factors aﬀect the PPG waveform and the peak delay between ECG and PPG: blood vessel hardness from the heart to the wrist, the arm position with respect to the heart, and the blood pressure. Moreover, one can infer blood pressure and blood vessel hardness using features extracted from ECG and PPG. Rather than transmitting raw data, the amount of transmitted data can be greatly reduced to one data transmission per heartbeat, by executing on-node

blood pressure estimation.
4.1.4 Machine Learning
By processing not only feature extraction but also recognition on node, the amount of transmission data can be minimized. Machine learning approaches using Support Vector Machine (SVM) [19] and neural networks [57] are usually employed.
In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have received particular attention as signal processing approaches for ECG and other bio-signals. Several reports of the relevant literature [58]–[63] describe that DNN can improve bio-signal detection and classiﬁcation accuracy. Atrial ﬁbrillation detection [64]–[66] and biometric identiﬁcation using ECG [67] are hot issues in this research area.
4.2 Computation Power Reduction
4.2.1 Normally-Oﬀ Computing and Nonvolatile Memory
Power reduction techniques for signal processing circuits are described. Table 2 presents the frequency components of several biological signals. Because the frequency range of biological signals is low, both standby power reduction and sleep time maximization are eﬀective for system level power reduction. Therefore, normally oﬀ computing technology was introduced using nonvolatile memory [68]–[71]. This technology is a control that turns oﬀ the power when the circuit is not used. In Fig. 13, a blue line represents a power consumption transition in the case of volatile memory, and a red line represents the power consumption transition in the case of a nonvolatile memory. In nonvolatile memory, because the power supply is gate-controlled in the standby mode, the leakage current can be greatly reduced. Izumi et al. used FeRAM as nonvolatile memory.
Figure 14 shows the average consumption current

Fig. 14 Average consumption currents for data logging using various mixed memories.

Fig. 15 Block diagram of ECG SoC [68].
when various mixed memories are used for data logging. By making FeRAM operate with intermittent operation (normally oﬀ), average current less than that of SRAM is realized in the heart rate and electrocardiographic region. Because the SRAM can not turn oﬀ the power supply, standby leakage current exists so that the current continues to ﬂow even in regions with low access frequency.
To realize both nonvolatility and high-speed access characteristics, a 6T-4C memory cell coupling an SRAM cell and ferroelectric capacitor was developed. Furthermore, nonvolatile technology was introduced into all the Flipﬂops embedded in Nonvolatile MCU [72], [73] as shown in Fig. 15. Thereby, the transition overhead is minimized so that the standby period can be maximized. Results show that the average operating current was reduced to 6.14 μA in the ECG processing circuit section [68] (see Fig. 16).

4.2.2 Hardware Accelerator
An eﬃcient architecture to minimize power consumption is a combination of dedicated HW + general-purpose processors. Cortex M 0 and RISC core are often used as generalpurpose processors. They carry a dedicated H/W circuit for biometric signal processing with a high computation load. Functions integrated as an accelerator in electrocardiogram wave analysis and acceleration sensing are presented in Table 3, which includes autocorrelation, frequency analysis (FFT, AR model), noise removal, compression processing, ﬁltering, feature extraction, and SVM.
Recent deep learning and neural network development opens the possibility of extracting more detailed information from data acquired using a wearable sensor. Because performance and accuracy are extremely important, deep learning, sensor fusion, and heavy calculation processing are executed oﬀ-platform on the cloud. Conventional signal processing and feature extraction processing are executed by the dedicated circuits of the node.
4.3 Sensing Power Reduction
4.3.1 ECG Sampling Rate Reduction
Nishikawa et al. proposed a sampling rate reduction method for heart rate variability analysis for low-power wearable devices [74]. With the introduction of interpolation processing and autocorrelation operation, the sampling rate is reduced to 32 Hz while maintaining a heartbeat interval error of 1 ms or less. Better results are obtained for PPG waveforms distributed at frequencies lower than ECG.
4.3.2 PPG Sampling Rate Reduction
Reduction of the sampling rate is particularly eﬀective at reducing the power used by the PPG sensor. The power

consumption of LEDs and PDs are dominant in PPG. Watanabe et al. proposed a low rate sampling technique combining Correlated Double Sampling technology with the linear interpolation process and autocorrelation operation described above [75]. A complete PPG sensor equipped with MCU, LED, PD, and other technologies was implemented. It achieved MAE error of 5 ms, which is suﬃciently low for heart rate variability analysis with a 150 μs LED turn-on time and a 16 Hz sampling rate. Results show that the LED power was reduced by 85.9% compared with the conventional device. The power consumption of the whole PPG sensor was reduced to 22 μA.
4.3.3 Adaptive Sampling of Acceleration
Tsukahara et al. realized low-power consumption by adaptively changing the sampling frequency of the acceleration sensor according to behavior classiﬁcation: 32 Hz, 16 Hz, 8 Hz, 4 Hz [76], [77]. In a simulation result resembling that of an actual use, about 56% power reduction eﬀect was conﬁrmed. Additionally, the error accompanying the frequency change was conﬁrmed to be as small as 0.14 METs in the root mean square error (RMSE) with respect to the case in which the sampling frequency was ﬁxed in physical activity estimation accuracy.
Nakanishi et al. proposed a highly accurate technique of behavior classiﬁcation considering gravitational acceleration and a control method that directly changes the sampling frequency to a speciﬁc frequency according to behavior classiﬁcation results [78]. The proposed method reduced the acceleration sensor active rate by about 23%. Results show that the behavior classiﬁcation system operated at about 9.8 μA current consumption.

Fig. 17 Eﬀect of electrode distance for SNR.
5. Accuracy Enhancement
5.1 Noise Reduction and Noise Tolerance
Figure 17 presents the inter-electrode distance dependence of the SNR [79]. The SNR improves as the distance between the electrodes increases. To reduce the sensor size, a shorter inter-electrode distance is better. A tradeoﬀ exists between wearable size realization and SNR enhancement. Because ECG measures the potential diﬀerence on the body surface, the SNR is aﬀected by the electrode distance. Therefore, it is apparent that a design with high noise tolerance not only improves the reliability of measured data: it also contributes greatly to sensor size reduction.
A widely used approach for IHR extraction from ECG is R-wave extraction using threshold determination. The Pan–Tompkins (PT) algorithm [82], which is commonly used for beat detection, uses band-pass ﬁltering, diﬀerentiation, squaring, and moving window integration. Periodically, the threshold is adjusted automatically using QRS morphology and the heart rate. The SQRS [83] algorithms, which have been published in PhysioNet, can detect QRS based on the ECG slope. The SQRS uses band pass

ﬁltering for noise reduction, which uses only the integer coeﬃcient. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) [81], [84], [85] uses a wavelet transform with quadratic spline wavelet (QSW). The threshold is calculated using the root mean square value of the wavelet transform. This algorithm has been used in robust ECG monitoring LSIs [81], [86], [87]. The QSW requires few calculations and low hardware costs because it can be implemented merely by using adders and shift operators. The Quad Level Vector (QLV) algorithm [88] is used with dedicated hardware for ECG monitoring LSI [80], [89]. The QLV is generated using DWT and the adaptive threshold. Then the threshold is ascertained from the maximum mean deviation (MD) of prior heartbeats. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) algorithm [90]–[92] uses a Mexican hat wavelet in the frequency interval of 15–18 Hz. The R-peak can be extracted using the adaptive threshold, which is calculated using the modulus maxima of the CWT. This algorithm was also implemented in an earlier study [80].
The ECG waveform used for wearable sensors is often contaminated by noise from various sources such as baseline drift, hum noise, muscle noise, and motion artifacts, as portrayed in right portion of Fig. 18 [79]. Left portion of Fig. 18 presents frequency characteristics of PT, SQRS, and DWT with a 128 Hz sampling rate. A baseline drift and a hum noise can be removed easily using digital ﬁlters. However, unfortunately, muscle noise and motion artifacts are diﬃcult to remove because they have a similar frequency range to ECG. Therefore, false positive and false negative detections occur frequently in the conventional threshold approach.
Short-term autocorrelation (STAC) has been proposed for IHR extraction to remove muscle noise and motion artifacts (Fig. 19) [79]. Autocorrelation [93], [94] and template matching [95] use similarity of QRS complex waveforms. They have no threshold calculation process. Figure 20 presents the performance of hardware implementation of the heart rate extraction algorithm [23] with MIT-BIH arrhythmia [96] and noise stress [97] database. The STAC technique has higher noise tolerance and minimum power

overhead compared to previous results found for hardware implemented heartbeat detectors.
5.2 Recognition Accuracy
Heart rate can be measured using ECG, but also by PPG and BIO-Z. Combining these methods can considerably improve the reliability and robustness of measurement data. More accurate and reliable health assessment can be provided over a wider range. In such cases, electronic systems must be able to synchronize and measure multiple modalities accurately. Konijnenburg et al. proposed a batterydriven multi-parameter recording platform with built-in simultaneous support of ECG, BIO-Z, GSR, and PPG [25]. Because the data are collected on a single chip, very accurate synchronization between the data streams is possible. Correlation techniques between the data streams can be implemented. Such techniques support the study of blood pressure estimation by combining ECG and PPG measurements by pulse arrival time analysis. Furthermore, by combining diﬀerent sensing modalities such as ECG, PPG, and BIOZ, reliable estimates of hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability are obtained.
Simultaneous measurement of PPG and ECG is also suitable for measuring the pulse transit time, which is an important factor of correlation for cuﬄess blood pressure measurement [26]. Sharma et al. proposed a wearable

IEICE TRANS. ELECTRON., VOL.E102–C, NO.4 APRIL 2019 254

platform using SoC that simultaneously captures ECG and PPG. They developed a device that wirelessly transmits heartbeats to smartphones every 2 s. It operates continuously for more than 5 days with a 250 mAh battery.
Using a multimodal approach combining heart rate data and triaxial acceleration data, a highly accurate algorithm of behavior classiﬁcation and SoC for accurate human behavior analysis has been developed [78], [98]–[101]. For energy consumption estimation, the physical activity classiﬁcation algorithm uses three indicators: heart rate reserve (% HRreserve), synthetic acceleration (ACCﬁl), and ratio of ﬁltered acceleration to unﬁltered acceleration (RFU). The heart rate reserve is expressed as follows:

%HRreserve

=

HRact − HRreserverest HRmax − HRreserverest

The heart rate during activity (HRact): the mean value of averaged heart rate in every 10 s. The heart rate at rest (HRrest): the mean value of the averaged heart rate in a supine condition during 10 min. The maximum heart rate (HRmax): HRmax = 220−Age. The synthetic value of ﬁltered triaxial acceleration is expressed as follows:

ACCﬁl = X f 2 + Y f 2 + Z f 2

Here, X f , Y f , Z f are 3D components of ﬁltered triaxial acceleration. RFU (Ratio of ﬁltered and unﬁltered synthetic acceleration) is expressed as follows:

RFU =

Xu2 + Yu2 + Zu2 Xf2 + Yf2 + Zf2

Here, Xu, Yu, Zu are 3D components of unﬁltered triaxial acceleration. Using these three indices, a decision tree is constructed to classify physical activity into ﬁve classes: sedentary, household, moderate (excluding locomotive), locomotive, and vigorous. The algorithm has been implemented on the MCU embedded in the SoC. Evaluation results show that the average classiﬁcation accuracy for 21 activities is 91% [98], [101]. A highly reconﬁgurable analog front-end (AFE) IC supporting multi-modal (bio)signal monitoring has been reported [102]. The reconﬁgurable AFE channel occupies an area of 1.1mm2 while supporting four acquisition modes, i.e. biopotential (ExG), bio-impedance (BioZ), galvanic skin response (GSR) and general purpose analog (GPA). It consumes 36μW maximum from a 1.2V supply.

6. Future Direction

Daily monitoring by biological information sensors will be incorporated into the medical system in near future. In other words, personal biological information is accumulated in a database of medical institutions via a network, which will be

useful for disease treatment and health management. In that case, what is important is a security function and authentication technology [62], [103]–[107]. With biometric authentication, memorization and password input are unnecessary. Also, since it is not necessary to have any physical ID information, the burden on the user can be reduced. In addition, there is little risk that other people steal passwords. “Impersonation” is diﬃcult. These facts indicate that biometrics authentication is a suﬃciently safe and convenient approach for practical applications. Cardiovascular information related to cardiovascular apparatuses has attracted attention as biological information which is not used in conventional biometric authentication methods. For example, the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the extent of electrical excitation of the heart and can clarify the individual diﬀerence of the QRS components representing the excitement of the ventricle. It is possible to generate the ID by extracting the features of the QRS component from a certain period of the ECG.
In order to make biological information monitoring of each individual everyday comfortable and to promote data dissemination, it is necessary to make noncontact monitoring technology more practical. Although a lot of wearable sensor devices have been developed for ECG and heart rate measurement, these systems require pasting of wet electrodes directly onto the skin, which presents shortcomings in usability. Therefore, a non-contact heart rate monitoring is required. To realize remote heart rate monitoring, the microwave Doppler sensors [108]–[113] have been proposed to detect the heart velocity. Imaging-based methods using the color change of the face, which indicates the pulse beat, has also been proposed [114]. Although these methods present severe noise contamination problems, the heart rate can be detected without direct skin contact. A noncontact measurement method using capacitively coupled electrodes has been also proposed [115]–[119]. The capacitively coupled ECG sensor has high usability because it can take measurements even if an insulator such as clothing is interposed between the electrode and the human body.
As mentioned in Sect. 2, a battery-less system is desirable for lightweight miniaturization and lower cost. As an energy source of energy harvesting for a wearable device, heat, vibration, light, electromagnetic waves and the like are conceivable. The energy harvester from ambient electromagnetic waves cannot generate suﬃcient energy yet with small antenna size applicable to wearable sensors. The expected power generation is less than 1 μW [120]. Thermal power generation uses Seebeck element to convert the temperature diﬀerence across the element into electric power. Body temperature can be used as a heat source in this application. Since the temperature diﬀerence of the Seebeck element is generated from the diﬀerence between the body temperature and the outside temperature, eﬃciency decreases when the element is covered with clothes or the outside air temperature is high. The power generation is on the order of 10 μW to 100 μW per square centimeter with the body temperature [120]. Although the photovoltaic energy harvester

can generate almost same energy from ambient light [120], it limits the position of wearable sensors. In vibration power generation, vibration is converted into electric power using a piezo element or an electret. When converting the vibration of the human body into electric power by these elements, the power which can be taken out on average is less than 10 μW [121]. However, since it is greatly inﬂuenced by the exercise intensity, it is necessary to devise measures such as combining with exercise intensity and an algorithm that adaptively processes according to the amount of power generation. Also, since the frequency of the vibration of the human body is low and it is not constant, it is diﬃcult to increase the eﬃciency. A structure for upconverting the vibration frequency and a technique for widening the resonance frequency are studied. Although heat or vibration is considered to have the widest applicable range, at the present time, there is a problem with the amount of power generation and stable operation. Consequently development of power eﬃciency improvement technology suitable for the human body is awaited.
7. Conclusion
Digital health is one of the most promising ﬁelds of application in the Cyber-Physical System. Supported by the information network infrastructure, it will be incorporated into the social system and grow into an essential infrastructure of medical systems. And VLSI sensor devices promote their progress. Battery-less, low power consumption, high accuracy, wearable, low cost, security function are indispensable requirements, and it will be further evolving from now on. We expect this review to be useful for researchers, engineers, and policymakers working in the area of VLSI design for the healthcare application.
