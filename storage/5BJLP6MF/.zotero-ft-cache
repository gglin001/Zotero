A New Image Blood Pressure Sensor Based on PPG, RRT, BPTT, and Harmonic Balancing
Sheng-Chieh Huang, Pei-Hsuan Hung, Chung-Hung Hong, and Hui-Min Wang

Abstract— A new blood pressure (BP) sensor, also named sphygmomanometer, is developed in this paper for estimating BPs accurately from ﬁngertips. The hardware of the sensor is a low-cost optical CMOS imaging device for detecting photoplethysmography (PPG) signals at ﬁngertips. Therefore, the sensor neither needs to contact human skin nor pressurize it for accurate BP predictions. To calculate BPs based on captured PPG signals, the modiﬁed radial resonance theory is applied to develop a new BP transport theory (BPTT), and then composes a computation algorithm for implementing BPTT in a typical smart phone with limited computation load required. The algorithm is successfully implemented in a typical smart phone with minimum computation load and equipped with an efﬁcient calibration process. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the designed BP-sensing techniques. The resulted data clearly show that the difference between the systolic BPs (SBPs) sensed by the propose sensor and a validated cumbersome instrument is 1.37 mmHg, while for diastolic BPs (DBPs) is −1.40 mmHg. The afore-reported accuracy is well below those required by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, which are ±5 and 8 mmHg, respectively, for SBPs and DBPs.
Index Terms— Photoplethysmography (PPG), blood pressure sensor, radial resonance theory, sphygmomanometer, blood pressure transport theory.

the whole system is cumbersome, recently, new methods have been under development for next-generation “cufﬂess” sensors, like radio-frequency (RF) detective methods, photoplethysmography (PPG) method, etc [1]–[5]. On the other hand, physical sensor hardware is also one of popular topics along with the aforementioned detection methods [6]. In this study, a novel non-invasive, non-pressurized method based PPG signals is developed to compute the blood pressures via the modiﬁed radial resonance theory [7]–[12] and a newlydeveloped blood pressure transport theory based on the digital images captured by a CMOS camera that can be incorporated into a smart phone. Since the whole measurement is executed in a non-invasive fashion, performable by the CMOS camera in smart phones and needing only a short period of time, the blood-pressure sensing methodology proposed herein would bring beneﬁts of continuous monitoring and comfort to the patients with hypertension problems.
The organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section II, the modiﬁed radial resonance theory and device are introduced. In Section III experimental results are discussed. In Section IV, conclusions are given.

I. INTRODUCTION
M ANY people suffer chronic cardiovascular diseases. To cope with these diseases, it is desired to develop simple, ubiquitous and non-invasive sensors to obtain physiological information for early and primitive diagnosis. Among varied physiological signals, like heart rate, glucose, ECG, EEG and blood pressures (BPs), the blood pressure is one of the most important informations for doctors to conduct diagnosis, however, it is very difﬁcult to detect as compared to all the other biological signals. For accurate blood pressures, one can adopt an invasive approach to obtain the correct blood pressure via clinical operations, but it is inconvenient and dangerous to health stability of a human body. Traditional non-invasive blood-measuring system includes an inﬂatable cuff, signal processing unit and controller, along with two calculation methods: auscultation and oscillation [17]. Since

II. METHOD AND THEORY
A. Modiﬁed Radial Resonance Theory
According to radial resonance theory (RRT) [7]–[11], a human arterial system can be regarded as a cylindrical elastic tube network with adherent ﬂuid [7]. Excited by the heart, the elastic blood vessel wall is then in periodic vibration with resulted radial dilations, further exhibiting propagation of pressure wave from one end of the artery to another. In this pressure wave propagation, the diameter at a given arterial location dilates periodically in accordance with pulsation, while the energy coming from heart is stored in the manner of elastic energy and passed along by arteries.
Equations of motion prescribing pressure wave propagation of arterial wall are ﬁrst derived for further accurate blood pressure predictions. The derivation essentially follows those in [7]. The external pressure of the arterial vessel tube is denoted by Pe, while the internal ﬂuid pressure is P. In the static condition, the ﬂuid pressure is Po, the inner radius of the cylinder is ro, and the thickness of the wall is ho. The excitation on the arterial tube is assumed of impulses at heart, at one end of tube. Z denotes the longitudinal coordinate along the artery, while r (Z,t) captures the radial dilation of the arterial tube. A small element that is part of the tube’s i -th segment at position Z is considered, which is of an axial length Z. An element with circumferential angle dθ

B. Blood Pressure Transport Theory (BPTT)
Typical blood waveforms are similar to the actual measurements as shown in Fig. 2. They can be seen as a periodic signal in one frequency as prescribed by Eq. (7), while its amplitudes varying with time evolves in another slower frequency [7]–[11]. The upper and lower envelopes of signal amplitude evolution as seen in Fig. 2 are actually commonly-known systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) waveforms, respectively. The difference between SBP and DBP waveforms is named “pulse pressure” (PP). The oscillating frequency of the pulse pressure results from heart beats, therefore in accordance with heart rate (HR) and following Eq. (7), while those of SBP and DBP enveloping waveforms are associated with other-order harmonics resulted from vibrations reﬂected from blood vessel extremities (the ends of cardiovascular system at limbs; arms and legs) and respirations, thus including other-order harmonics and respiratory rate (RR). Based on the characteristics seen in the waveforms shown in Fig. 2 – periodicity and varying amplitudes, the signal can be regarded as a periodic signal

in HR with its amplitude modulated between SBP and DBP in distinct-order harmonics and/or RR, i.e., the so-called “beating” phenomenon. Therefore, the method often used for prescribing amplitude modulation of propagating radio frequency signals [18] can be adopted herein to describe the transport of the blood pressure waveforms in Fig. 2 from one end of the arterial tube to another. Following this recommended method, at a given instant the blood pressures obeying Eqs. (6), (7) at different locations of the arterial tube, zi and zi+1, satisﬁes

P(zi+1, t) = P(zi , t)[a cos(ωbt) + (1 − a)],

(8)

where a is the strength coefﬁcient of amplitude modulation between systole and diastole, which is from 0 to 0.5, and ωb is the frequency of higher-order and/or HR harmonics riding on baseline oscillation due to heart beat P(zi, t). The subscript b stands for beating. Based on Eq. (8), one is able to predict BP waveform including SBPs and DBPs at any given location of the arterial vessel network based on the actual measurement at any other given arterial location. This newly developed theory in Eq. (8) is named “blood pressure transport theory (BPTT),” which would be realized by an algorithm in subsection II.D and further conﬁrmed by experiment in section III.

detected by the sensor is caused by dynamic blood vessel dilation. Considering the fact that as the arterial vessel dilates, it absorbs much light due to a larger volume, thus the PPG signal detected by sensor can be prescribed by

I (t) = I − kπr (t)2,

(9)

where I ’ is the intensity of the light sensed by the sensor; I is the intensity of the light without considering the absorption due to dynamic arterial vessel dilation; r (t) is the radius of the artery varying with dynamic dilation; k is the modulus of the absorbed energy per unit cross section of the area of the arterial tube. In Eq. (9), the ac component of I ’ is due to reﬂection of dynamic artery dilation, since blood vessel deforms as opposed to other relative still bio-structure and materials. The relationship between r (t) and blood pressure (BP), P(t), could be expressed as

πr (t)2 = CA P (t) + c,

(10)

where CA is the compliance of vessel size to blood pressure; c is a ﬁtting constant. Substituting Eq. (10) into (9) yields

I (t) = −kCA P (t) + I0,

(11)

where I0 accounts for integral constant (dc) effects. Based on the linear relation between BP and PPG signals in Eq. (11), the PPG signals are ready for extracting BPs with appropriate calibrations.

C. PPG Sensors
The application of BPTT is practiced in this study by the case that PPG signals are sampled at ﬁngertip by varied sensors, while the computation algorithm developed later based on BPTT would be able to predict BPs at the artery outlet from the heart (doctors’ favorable) and the upper arm (traditional BP measurement device) based on the PPGs sensed at ﬁngertip. The sensor hardware could be an interposed array of infrared light emitter diodes (IR-LEDs) and photo detectors (PDs) or the module of an LED or a CMOS camera [16] integrated in a typical smart phone, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The light emitted by LEDs reaches skin, penetrates to arteries beneath, and then reﬂects. The reﬂected light is ﬁnally detected by the sensor as PPG signals. Note that along varied traces, the light intensities are all attenuated by absorptions through skins, muscles, bones and blood. Due to relative stillness of skins, muscles and bones to blood vessel, any temporal variation embedded in the reﬂected light intensity waveform

D. Computation Algorithm for BPTT
With PPG sensors ready, the proposed BPTT is applied to develop a computation algorithm to estimate DBPs and SBPs at one location of the arterial tube based on BP waveforms elsewhere. This task is regarded very important as doctors need information of “absolute” BP in DBPs and SBPs for diagnosis. This “absolute” BP is deﬁned as those at the arterial outlet from the heart, i.e., aorta. Due to this, all the qualiﬁed noninvasive BP measurement devices available in the market need to be carefully calibrated before usage to accurately predict the “absolute” BP in DBP and SBP, actually correlating well to BPs at heart outlet, based on measurements elsewhere. These calibrations are conducted via non-theoretical based low- or high-order interpolations. Moderate inaccuracy results are expected, mostly resulted from lack of theoretical basis for these interpolations. With BPTT established and its computation algorithm developed, higher accuracy by less calibration times are expected.

and S4 can be obtained as below,

P(z4, t) = P(z2, t)[a32 cos(4ωt) +(1 − a32)][a43 cos(4ωt) + (1 − a43)]. (14)

From Eq. (7), P(z2, t) and P(z4, t) can be expressed as a series combination of harmonics based on heart rate, that is,

P(z2, t) = P2,0 + P2,1 cos ωt + P2,2 cos 2ωt

Fig. 5. Upper extremity vessels of the cardiovascular system.
The development for the algorithm for BPTT is started with considering the upper extremity vessels the cardiovascular system as shown in Fig. 5, where sections S1 to S4 are, respectively, aorta, major artery, small artery, and periphery [13], which correspond human body locations of to heart outlet, upper arm, forearm and ﬁngertips, respectively. Based on the BPTT developed in Eq. (8), PPG signals measured at S4 (ﬁngertips) can be used to render accurate BPs at S1 (aorta), which is desired by doctors for effective diagnosis. In this duty, however, due to great difﬁculty to obtain realistic data of BPs at aorta, the development of the algorithm is practiced for predicting BPs at S2 (forearm) based on the PPG signals measured at S4 (ﬁngertips). In parallel with the measured PPGs at S4, the BP at S2 is also measured by a validated commercial BP device. Once the computation algorithm is developed for predicting BPs at S2 based on S4, the parameters are calibrated by commercial data at S2 and then the performance of BPTT is evaluated based on the comparison of the BPs predicted by the algorithm to commercial data.
The development of the algorithm is started with adopting the results in the work [15], which stated that the frequency of the main component of SBP and DBP waveforms in the upper arm, forearm and ﬁngers (S2, S3 and S4, respectively) are approximately four times of heart rate, i.e., 4ωb. Thus, according to Eq. (8), the relationship between the blood pressure waveform P(z3, t) at S3 location and the blood pressure waveform P(z4,t) at S4 location can be characterized by
P(z4, t) ≈ P(z3, t) [a43 cos(4ωt) + (1 − a43)], (12)
where a43 denotes the strength coefﬁcient of systole and diastole as transport from S3 to S4. The relationship of blood pressure waveforms between S2 and S3 is similar to the above, i.e.,
P(z3, t) ≈ P(z2, t) [a32 cos(4ωt) + (1 − a32)], (13)
where a32 denotes the strength coefﬁcient of systole and diastole as transport from S3 to S4. Combining Eqs. (12) and (13), the relation between the blood pressure waveforms at S2

Substituting the expressions in Eqs. (15) into (14), expanding

all harmonics at both sides of the equation and then performing

the well-known harmonic balancing for ﬁrst- and second-order

harmonics yield P4,1 and P4,2, as belows,

(17)

The equation used for harmonic balancing that leads to

Eqs. (16), (17) is given in Appendix. In theory, the strength

coefﬁcients of a32 and a43 can be solved via Eqs. (16), (17) based on calibrations and Fourier transforms on P(z3, t) and P(z3, t). Then P2,1 and P2,2 are solved subsequently based on Eqs. (16), (17). With solved P2,1 and P2,2, higher-order components associated with the blood pressures at S2 can then

be also found, able to predict SBPs, DBPs and PPs at S2.

Aiming for less computation load for the CPU in a smart

phone, i.e., no Fourier Transforms and solving nonlinear

algebraic equations (17), approximations are further assumed

to simplify the computation process of predicting SBPs and

DBPs at S2 based on S4, which is started with recognizing

the aforementioned fact as illustrated by Fig. 2 that SBP

is the summation of PP and DBP. The main oscillatory

component of the blood pressure is in the frequency of heart

beat (HB), which is characterized mainly by pulse pressure

(PP), following the method presented in this study. Since the

HB components in the formulation (15a) are captured by P2,1, the PP at S2 to predict can be assumed as

P P2 = c1,P P P2,1 + c0,P P ,

(18)

where c1,PP and c0,PP are interpolation parameters. Noting that all a’s are in small values, thus, P2,1 ≈ P4,1 based on Eq. (16),
then, Eq. (18) becomes

P P2 = c1,P P P4,1 + c0,P P .

(19)

Having effective calibration to identify c1,PP and c0,PP, Eq. (19) is ready to be used for predicting pulse pressure (PP) at S2 based on the magnitude of the ﬁrst-order harmonic at HR measured at S4.

With PPs obtained at desired location, efforts are next paid

to predict diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) at S2 based on S4.

Based on the characterization of blood pressure waveforms as

illustrated in Fig. 2, SBP can be calculated by summing DBP

and PP. To solve for DBP, the harmonic balancing on Eq. (A1)

for zero- and fourth-order harmonics at both sides yields

(20a) (20b)

The above two equations reveals that the zero- and fourthorder harmonics at S2, P2,0 and P2,4, are both linear combinations of P4,0 and P4,4. On the other hand, based on the deﬁnition of DBP as illustrated by Fig. 2 is the constant (dc)
part of the blood pressure waveform, that is, proportional to
P2,0; therefore, the DBP at S2 to be predicted by measured waveforms at S4 can be formulated by

Fig. 6. Functional blocks of proposed sensor system.

D B P2 = c1,D B P P4,0 + c2,D B P P4,4 + c0,D B P. (21)

Finally, SBP at S2 is the sum of DBP and PP, yielding

S B P2 = D B P2 + P P2.

(22)

With Eqs. (19), (21) and (22) in hands, one is able to predict SBP and DBP at forearm (S2) by measured PPG waveforms at ﬁngertips (S4) and properly-calibrated parameters, c1,D B P, c2,D B P, c0,D B P, c1,P P and c0,P P . The characteristics of the measurements at S4 required for BP predictions at S2 are zero-, ﬁrst- and fourth-order harmonics. These harmonics can be extracted effectively and efﬁciently by utilizing appropriate band-pass ﬁlters at designated frequencies. Finally, it is pertinent to note herein that the characteristics of the established Eqs. (19), (21) and (22) complies with those reported by [15] which found zero-, ﬁrst- and fourth-order harmonics at the ends of cardiovascular branches affects the waveforms measured at front parts of the human arterial system, including forearm. In theory, this is due to nonlinear harmonic reﬂection at the extremities of arterial vessels and branches. Also found is that when the energy of the 4th harmonic of the blood pressure waveform, P4,4, decreases, the dc part of the blood pressure waveform, P4,0, increased, coinciding with the fact that the values of c2,D B P identiﬁed later in experiments are often negative, opposite to that of c1,D B P.
III. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
With BPTT and algorithm developed, an experimental platform with multiple physiological diagnosis functions is built for regional blood pressure detections and ensuing computations based on the algorithm. The proposed platform consists of two parts: (1) the peripheral kernel with Altera Nios II embedded system and (2) the PPG analysis kernel. The key idea herein is to design for a quick veriﬁcation prototype on a portable system, like a mobile smart phone. The physiological signal detection device can then be easily added with the peripheral kernel. The overview of this platform is shown

Fig. 7. The experiment platform.
in Fig. 6. The peripheral kernel is established by Nios II embedded system with 100-MHz clock rate on the DE2 Design Kit. The kernel is proposed to serve as a peripheral interface manager. All of the peripheral interface, like the keypad, SDRAM, ﬂash, audio CODEC, SD Card, RS-232, LCM, the HRV and PPG analysis kernel are controlled by this kernel as shown in Fig. 7.
Experiments were conducted for 5 healthy subjects aged between 20 and 24 years old. The environment of this experiment was in a room at temperature about 25 °C. The tests for stability of the sensor and algorithm is performed. Prior to the stability test for each subject, calibration was performed to obtained parameter values of c1,D B P, c2,D B P, c0,D B P, c1,P P and c0,P P . For example, for subject 1, the identiﬁed values of c1,D B P, c2,D B P, c0,D B P, c1,P P and c0,P P are (8.72, 134.56, 83.71, 9.34, 6.28), respectively. With all c’s identiﬁed, the sensor platform was operated to predict SBPs, DBPs and PPs at forearm based on the blood pressure waveforms in PPGs sensed at ﬁngertips. The results are summarized in Table. I, where it is seen that for each subject, two-time measurements are taken for evaluating the stability of the sensor system, the error percentage of predicted SBPs and

(average age of 22.19 years old while standard deviation of 1.5 years). The environment of this experiment was in a room at temperature about 25 ± 2 °C. The measurements are compared to Omron sphygmomanometer for different people, which are listed in Table. II. The results listed in Table II are also illustrated by Fig. 8. Seen from the obtained experimental data given in Table II, the average on the differences between the SBPs sensed by the proposed sensor and Omron’s is 1.37 mmHg, while for DBPs is −1.40 mmHg. The standard deviations are 7.61 (mmHg) and 6.00 (mmHg) for SBPs and DBPs, respectively. The afore-reported averages and standard deviations are well below those required by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), which are ±5 mmHg and 8 mmHg, respectively, for SBPs and DBPs. The successfully-developed algorithm is implemented in a smart phone with a designed user interface, as shown in Fig. 9.

DBPs to their corresponding averages were controlled under 6%, a satisfactory performance.
With stability satisﬁed, experiments were conducted with 30 healthy subjects aged between 21 and 27 years old

IV. DISCUSSION
Blood pressures in systole and diastole are successfully measured by a newly-established blood pressure transport theory (BPTT) and its ensuing computation algorithm. With the algorithm, the developed sensor system can be easily calibrated and then used for predicting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBPs and DBPs) based on PPG signals that can be sensed by a portable device, like a CMOS image camera in a smart phone, further paving the way for ubiquitous blood

pressure sensing. The sensor and methodology presented in this study lead to satisfactory levels of accuracy in predicting SBPs and DBPs as compared to the standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Future efforts will be dedicated to improve the proposed methodology for long-range sensing such that ubiquitous and convenient blood pressure sensing becomes possible and set the bases for diagnosis.
