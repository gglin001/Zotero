Heart Rate Variability
• The cardiac cycles of a healthy human heart are not constant. • This variation in the subsequent cardiac cycles is referred to Heart Rate Variability (HRV). • The gold-standard is to extract the variability information from the RR-intervals in ECG. • Measurement of 24-hour HRV is not always feasible, hence, use of short-term .i.e. 5 minute
HRV. Importance of HRV • HRV determines the energy, dynamism and ability to respond to a threat.-- Physical fitness • Underpins the ability to think clearly and have greater perceptive abilities.-- Mental Well-being • HRV is important for well-being. Predicts risk of major illness and ill health.-- Clinical Diagnosis
HRV is an important vital sign.

Measurement of HRV from wearables
• Paradigm shift to individual centered health-care from a hospital centered one.
• Such a shift undeniably has a positive outcome on patient-care front. Thus, compels innovative design and further research on wearable technology.
• Improve serviceability of wearable. • Many derived signs like stress, long-term cardiac ailments etc. can be detected in advance.

Problem Statement
• Several works suggest surrogacy of ECG derived HRV to the ones derived from PPG[1]. From now on PPG derived HRV will be referred as PRV (Pulse Rate Variability) throughout the presentation. • Most studies show the agreement of PRV to HRV only from the extremities of body like fingers,
ear-lobes[2] etc. using transmittance photoplethysmography (to be explained in later slides). • Limited works show use of wrist-based reflective photoplethysmography as a reliable measure
for HRV.
In the presented work the use of wrist based PPG as an alternate to ECG for HRV, is proposed.

Underlying principle of wearable cardiac monitors

Photoplethysmography (PPG)

Reflective Photoplethysmography

• Pulsatile component • Steady component • Optical signal transduced to electrical
domain

Novel optical sensor scheme
State-of-the-art : Most commercial devices use 495nm – 530 nm as optical emitters for HR wrist-based
wearables. Low signal quality due to skin pigmentation are not addressed.
Motivation for a new scheme : Optical skin property, melanin is a prevalent dermal component in majority of the world’s
demographics. Sensor must accommodate for this.
7

Understanding skin-light interaction
• Melanin absorption- 350nm to 1200nm • Progressive decrease • Reflective PPG is superior with visible
spectra long wavelengths like IR • Usual choice – 500nm to 540 nm • Proposed choice – 590nm
8

Choice of optical elements
• Optical Emitter (LYT64F)
• Optical Receiver (TEMD5080X01)

• 590 nm • Black Packaging • Dome lens (30°)
• Wide band (entire visible region) • 70 mm2

Study objective and Data collection
• Study Objective : To investigate the use of in-house developed wrist-wearable to analyse timedomain features of short-term HRV.
• Subject inclusion : 5 healthy subjects with an age distribution of 31±3 years. • Ambient settings :
– Locations : Leh and Pangong Lake of Ladakh. – Average temperature : 6◦C, oxygen levels – Oxygen level : 82%-92% – Altitude : 3400 meters • Data Collection – Subjects acclimatized prior to data acquisition. – Explained the collection protocol and familiarized with equipment. – ECG : eMotion Faros 360◦ (Mega Electronics) in single lead configuration at 1000 Hz. – PPG : developed wearable at 500 Hz.
PPG and ECG signals were collected simultaneously.

Algorithm used for extracting HRV indices
• Pre-processing : Savitzky-golay filter realized to have a cut-off of 10 Hz.
• Generation of Acceleration Plethysmograph (APG Velocity plethysmogram (VPG) :5-point central difference method Acceleration plethysmogram (APG) : 7-point central difference method
14

Algorithm used for extracting HRV indices
• Feature extraction  Below zero-baseline nulled and positive part is quadrupled.  Generate blocks of interest.  Maxima in each block peak of APG Difference between APG peaks denote the PPG interval.

Time-domain HRV indices
Cardiac intervals are referred as NN-intervals.
NN-intervals from ECG are extracted using Pan-Tompkins algorithm[5].
HRV time-domain indices are calculated from both ECG and PPG NN-intervals using the following definitions:

RMSSD SDNN SDSD pNN50

Root mean square of successive difference
Standard deviation between NN-intervals
Standard deviation of successive differences
Ratio of the number of NN-intervals greater than 50 ms to the total number of NN-intervals

Experimental Results
• Bland-Altman plot to show the agreement between measurements from both methods. • Limits of agreement (LOA) = + 95%
17

Experimental Results
• Pearson’s correlation(r) to verify the temporal similarity between the tachograms for all the subjects derived from both the methods result in r>0.995.

Experimental Results
max (Relative Error) < 5% 19

Conclusions
• Designed optical sensor provides high-quality signals even at extremely low perfusion levels. • Our results indicate that the differences between the HRV derived parameters obtained from
PPG are statistically insignificant (within 95% of agreement) from the gold-standard. • Developed wearable can be used for short term HRV monitoring. Another study[6] to conducted
on various orthostatic loads over 60 data-sets support this result. (Published in TIM, 2018) • This opens up the prospect of HRV monitoring not just restricted to ambulatory events and
extensively expands the serviceability of HRV.
Future Work
• Algorithm is implemented in MATLAB 2016 which can be implemented as an application on the host processor.
This would make it a comprehensive measurement system. • Similarly data acquisition system can be further optimized and curated to allow better user
experience.
