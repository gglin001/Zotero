Preface
The heart is a remarkable electrically activated rhythmic muscular pump responsible for distributing blood to the lungs, brain visceral organs, skeletal muscle other organs and to itself. The intrinsic pumping rate is normally set by pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, but the resulting physiological rhythm is variable and highly modulated by the autonomic nervous system and humoral factors. Pathological heart rhythm is a major health issue. Sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias is a signiﬁcant cause of mortality worldwide. In the USA alone, it has been estimated that nearly 300,000 emergency medical services-treated cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital setting each year. In young adults, cardiac arrests are often associated with cardiac abnormalities (either structural or electrical) and can be triggered by intense physical activity or emotion. In adults, the most common underlying cause of lethal arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or ﬁbrillation) is coronary artery disease. A minority of cardiac arrests are due to extreme bradycardia or side effects of drug therapy or abuse. Treatment for cardiac arrhythmia includes drugs, implantable pacemakers or cardioverter/deﬁbrillator devices, catheter ablation or surgical resection.
Due to the primary importance of the heart in the life of vertebrates, it is only natural that the molecular and cellular basis of normal and pathophysiological heart rhythms is an intense area of both basic and biomedical research. During the past 50 years, biophysical approaches such as microelectrode recording of intracellular action potentials of isolated cardiac tissue and the voltage clamp technique used to record ionic currents in isolated myocytes led to the remarkable insights into our understanding of the electrical basis of cardiac pacemaking, impulse conduction and myocardial contraction. In the past few decades, molecular biology, genetics, and biochemical approaches have deﬁned the molecular basis, as well as the speciﬁc cellular location, of the plethora of ion channels and transporters that underlie the ionic currents identiﬁed by voltage clamp techniques and how their synchronized activity controls the basic rate and rhythm of the heart. The resulting information explosion has made it difﬁcult for investigators to keep abreast of new ﬁndings in ﬁelds outside their areas of expertise and served as motivation for this volume. Here we have endeavored to bring together experts from various ﬁelds who share a passion for understanding the mechanisms of cardiac pacemaking and arrhythmogenesis. Individual chapters cover a full range of topics, including the

Preface

ionic basis of pacemaking, the role of speciﬁc channels and transporters in sinoatrial node pacemaking, altered intracellular Ca2+ handling in response to disease, computer modeling of the action potentials of pacemaker and working cardiomyocytes, genetic and molecular basis of inherited arrhythmias, development of cardiac conduction system and a review of novel antiarrhythmic agents. Due to the key importance of the specialized pacemaker cells and tissue (sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, Purkinje ﬁbers) in maintaining heart rate and rhythm, special emphasis is placed on the peculiar electrophysiology of these cells. The intended audience for this book includes investigators in the ﬁelds of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, advanced graduate students, cardiologists and phrarmaceutical industry. It is our hope that the topics and unresolved issues highlighted here will serve to both educate and motivate continued interest in research of the complicated molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie normal and pathophysiological cardiac rhythms.
We thank all the experts who contributed chapters on various specialized topics for this book despite their very busy schedule. It has been a pleasure working with colleagues at Springer; Jutta Lindenborn offered sustained help and support at all the stages of preparation of this book. We appreciate the art work by Mr. Ali Kausar on several illustrations included in this book.

Chapter 1
Cardiac Ion Channels and Heart Rate and Rhythm
Onkar Nath Tripathi

1.1 Introduction
The heart beat originates in the form of spontaneous electrical activity of the primary pacemaker cells of sino-atrial node (SAN). An efﬁcient propagation of the electrical waveform initiated by this spontaneous electrical activity (action potentials, AP) to the atria and, via the cardiac conduction system, viz., atrioventricular node (AVN), Bundle of His, Bundle branches, and Purkinje ﬁbre network, to the rest of the heart brings about a highly coordinated rhythmic mechanical activity characterised by synchronised contraction and relaxation of different regions of heart. The cardiac cycle repeats itself throughout the life of an organism with a high level of efﬁciency and determines the heart rate and rhythm. The classical work of Carl Wiggers [see 1] on cardiac cycle identiﬁed the correlation between the electrical activity (electrocardiogram, ECG) and different parameters of mechanical activity, making it evident that the electrical cycle initiates the mechanical cycle. Excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling plays a crucial role in this process, through inﬂux of Ca2+ ions, facilitating conversion of the electrical energy into chemical energy required for myocardial contraction [2]. The two phases of the electrical cycle, viz. electrical systole and diastole, are clinically examined to assess the cardiac functions in the normal and diseased heart.
The electrical cycle, recorded with an ECG, begins with the P wave, reﬂecting the atrial depolarisation (Fig. 1.1). The PR interval, the time taken for atrial depolarisation to reach the AVN and beyond, is characteristically well preserved in different mammals. The PR interval is only one order of magnitude longer in humpback whales, the largest mammal, compared to the mouse even though their body mass differs by six orders of magnitude ([3]; Table 1.1). The QRS complex represents entry of the wave of excitation via the cardiac conduction system into the ventricles and depolarisation of ventricular myocytes. Subsequent repolarisation of

the ventricles is reﬂected in the T wave which is often followed by U wave, the cause of which is still unclear [4]. QT interval is the time required for repolarisation of the ventricles and corresponds roughly to the duration of ventricular APs. It serves as an important indicator for arrhythmogenic propensity of heart associated with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome.

Extracellular and cytosolic concentrations of Naþ, Kþ, Ca2þ, and ClÀ ions which offer passive electrochemical gradient for the ﬂow of ionic currents through ion channels are shown. The ionic currents underlie APs which can be recorded using classical glass microelectrode (El) techniques.

The cardiac electrical cycle is initiated and maintained by transmembrane ﬂux of ions via ion channels, exchangers, and pumps (Fig. 1.2). The speciﬁc tissue and subcellular distribution of a wide spectrum of ion channel types determines the AP shape and spread of the wave of excitation in the heart. Notable advances in the molecular basis of cardiac excitation and conduction are well covered in several recent reviews [5–8]. Fascinating aspects of development of the cardiac conduction system (Chap. 12) and its structural and molecular characteristics (Chap. 11) are presented in this book. This chapter provides an overview of some basic features of ion channels expressed in the heart, their likely contributions to ionic currents and APs, and their proposed role in cardiac activity.
1.2 Molecular Basis of Cardiac Electrical Activity
The cardiac AP is typically described with ﬁve distinct phases, namely phase 0 (upstroke), phase 1 (early repolarisation – notch), phase 2 (plateau), phase 3 (repolarisation), and phase 4 (resting potential or pacemaker potential or diastolic depolarisation). Ionic currents through electrogenic membrane ion transport

The cells of SAN, AVN and Purkinje ﬁber exhibit slow diastolic depolarization (DD, dotted lines).

proteins form the basis of the different phases of the AP (Fig. 1.3). These proteins are heterogeneously distributed in different types of heart cells endowed with speciﬁc functions, and their superbly orchestrated activity determines the characteristic conﬁguration of the AP. Ion channels allow passive ﬂux of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and ClÀ in a direction dictated by their concentration gradient across the membrane, and the resulting ionic currents contribute to maintenance of resting potential and generation and conduction of APs (Fig. 1.2); for modeling of cardiac AP see Chap. 9.

Palettes of ion channels in sarcolemma (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticular (SR), mitochondrial (MT), and nuclear (NUC) membranes differ signiﬁcantly in the same cell and in different types of heart cells. The SL electrogenic proteins primarily determine the shape of cardiac APs. However, the SR ion transport proteins have crucial roles in cardiac pacemaker activity, E–C coupling, and intracellular Ca homeostasis. MT ion channels contribute to the metabolic state of heart cells via excitation–metabolism coupling. NUC ion channels contribute to the transcriptional regulation of SL and MT ion transport and signalling proteins (excitation– transcription coupling), thereby contributing indirectly to heart rate and rhythm. Altered ion channel activity is frequently associated with arrhythmias and mutations in ion channel genes, in particular, cause several cardiac channelopathies.
On the basis of the primary gating (activating) factor, two major groups of ion channels have been identiﬁed: voltage-gated (VGIC) and ligand-gated (LGIC) ion channels. The VGICs, activated by change in membrane potential, contribute maximally to cardiac APs, and information on their genes, amino acid residues, conductance, kinetics, etc. is presented with respect to adult heart cells [22, 171].

1.3 Sarcolemmal Ion Channels
1.3.1 Voltage-Gated Na Channels
Nine different types of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) have been identiﬁed and are named after their a-subunits as NaV1.1–NaV1.9. Heart primarily expresses NaV1.5 (cardiac type), but is also reported to express the brain type Na channels, NaV1.1, NaV1.3, and NaV1.6 [9, 10]. The VGSCs carry a fast inward Na current, INa, that underlies the fast upstroke (phase 0) of AP in most cardiac cells.
VGSCs are heteromultimeric membrane proteins composed of four subunits: a, b, g, and d. The a-subunit is the primary functional unit and contains the pore, ion selectivity ﬁlter, voltage sensor, and the drug and toxin binding sites. An a-subunit has four domains (DI–DIV) each comprising of six TM segments (S1–S6). The four domains are arranged concentrically to form collectively a water-ﬁlled, open-ended central cavity. An inverted loop (P) between extracellular ends of S5 and S6 of each domain forms the selectivity ﬁlter and outer vestibule of the channel. S4 acts as the voltage sensor, due to its many positively charged amino acids. A short intracellular loop between DIII and DIV serves as an inactivation gate that is proposed to occlude the inner vestibule. The N and C termini of a-subunits are intracellular. Four bsubunits, b1–b4, are reported for VGSCs and are formed of one TM segment. The b-subunit regulates the localisation and functions of a-subunit and is involved in its interaction with the extracellular matrix, cytosolic linker proteins, and cell adhesion molecules (CAM). The following VGSCs have been identiﬁed in heart.
NaV1.1 (BrainI, Gene - SCN1A, 1998 amino acids (aa)) is expressed in ventricular myocytes [9] and SAN cells [10] and conducts a small or negligible INa. Two subunits, b1 and b2, are identiﬁed for this channel. The macroscopic INaV1.1 has a

8

O.N. Tripathi

voltage for 1/2 maximal (V0.5) activation of À19.6 to À13.7 mV and inactivation V0.5 of À41.9 to À37.9 mV. NaV1.1 is localised in the T-tubules of ventricular myocytes and is involved in E–C coupling in ventricles [9]. In SAN it is homo-
geneously distributed on SL and is associated with AP ﬁring frequency [10, 11].
NaV1.1 is blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) with high sensitivity and is activated by b scorpion toxin, CssIV [10].
NaV1.3 (Brain III, Gene - SCN3A, 2000 aa) is expressed in foetal and adult heart, ventricular myocytes [9], and in SAN cells [10]. It is reported to have two subunits, b1 and b3. NaV1.3 carries a small macroscopic INaV1.3 having activation V0.5 of À12 mV and inactivation V0.5 of À47.5 mV. NaV1.3 is also localised on T-tubules and plays a role in E–C coupling in ventricles [9] and mediates AP ﬁring in SAN
cells [10]. It is blocked by TTX with high sensitivity and is stimulated by CssIV.
NaV1.5 (h1, Cardiac, Gene - SCN5A, 2016 aa, ~20 pS) is the cardiac-speciﬁc VGSC and has four subunits, b1, b2, b3, and b4. NaV1.5 is localised on the intercalated discs in ventricles [9] and has important role in cell-to-cell conduction
of impulse in heart. NaV1.5 is also present in peripheral cells of SAN and is involved in conduction of SAN APs to atria [11]. A fast, transient inward Na current, INa, with rapid kinetics of activation (V0.5 À44 mV) and inactivation (V0.5 À87 mV) is mediated by NaV1.5 and contributes signiﬁcantly to the fast upstroke of AP in atria, ventricles, and Purkinje ﬁbres. NaV1.5 is reported to contribute signiﬁcantly to the late Na current, INaL [12]. NaV1.5 is relatively insensitive to the blocking effect of TTX and is more sensitive to STX. Class I
antiarrhythmics, e.g. lidocaine, procainamide, ﬂecainide, propafenone, etc. act by blocking NaV1.5. Ranolazine, a new antiarrhythmic drug, targets INaL [12]. NaV1.5 is implicated in sick sinus syndrome, Brugada syndrome and other cardiac arrhythmias [13]. As described in Chap. 22, gain of function mutations in SCN5A cause
type 3 long QT (LQT3) syndrome. NaV1.6 (Gene - SCN8A, 1980 aa) is expressed in the T-tubules of ventricular
myocytes [9]. It mediates a small current with activation V0.5 of À28.7 mV and inactivation V0.5 of À71.9 mV [14]. All four b subunits, b1–b4, are associated with NaV1.6. It is activated by b scorpion toxins and blocked by TTX. NaV1.6 is suggested to be involved in E–C coupling [9].
Interestingly, TTX is a potent inhibitor of the chick and ﬁsh heart INa as evident from studies on isolated ﬁsh ventricular myocytes and isolated chick ventricular
tissue which indicates a predominant role of other TTX-sensitive isoforms of
VGSCs in non-mammalian heart [15, 16].

1.3.2 Voltage-Gated Ca Channels
The voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) conduct an inward Ca current (ICa), which leads to elevation of intracellular Ca, a second messenger necessary for a large variety of cellular functions including cardiac contraction, impulse generation, secretion, neurotransmission, gene expression, development, and differentiation etc.

VGCCs facilitate conversion of the electrical energy into chemical energy for execution of cellular functions.
Three families of VGCCs are identiﬁed and are generally grouped under two categories depending on their activation voltage, viz. high voltage-activated (HVA) and low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca channels. The HVA Ca channels are activated at higher membrane voltages (i.e. more depolarised potentials) and include CaV1.x (L, N, and P/Q type) and CaV2.x (R type) VGCCs. The LVA Ca channels, CaV3.x (T type) VGCCs, are activated at low membrane voltages (i.e. more negative potentials). VGCCs are heteromultimeric membrane protein complexes of 4–5 subunits, viz. a1, a2, b, g, and d. The a1 (CaV) subunits of 150–250 kDa have essentially the same structure as NaV containing the pore, the voltage sensor, and binding sites for most of the pharmacological modulators [17]. The auxiliary subunits of VGCCs, a2, b, g, and d, are smaller proteins compared to a1; a2 is a 140 kDa extracellular protein and d a 27 kDa TM glycoprotein. The b subunits, b1–b4, are located intracellularly, have speciﬁc tissue distribution, and play important regulatory roles in surface expression and activation/inactivation kinetics of a1 subunit. The g subunit, formed of 4TM segments, is involved in assembly and surface expression of a1 subunit and other membrane signalling proteins.
Some of the salient features of the VGCCs expressed in heart are described below. CaV1.2 (Cardiac L-type Ca channel, a1C, Gene - CACNA1C, 2138 aa, 8 pS with Ca) is strongly expressed in all regions of heart and is localised in the T-tubules of ventricular myocytes [18]-see Chap. 13. A cardiac-speciﬁc isoform, CaV1.2a, has been identiﬁed [19]. b1–b4 accessory subunits are differentially distributed at the subcellular level. Four a2d isoforms are also reported as the auxiliary subunits of CaV1.2 [20]. CaV1.2 current, ICa,L, contributes to the plateau phase (phase 2) of ventricular APs and plays a key role in E–C coupling [2]. In SAN, ICa,L underlies the slow upstroke of APs and is also considered to contribute to pacemaker potential [21]. The ventricular macroscopic ICa,L has activation V0.5 of À4.8 mV and t of 5–7 mS; the inactivation V0.5 is À20.4 mV and tf and ts are 20.4 ms and 61–133 ms, respectively [22]. The organic Ca channel blockers (CCBs), dihydropyridines (DHP; e.g. nifedipine), phenylalkylamines (e.g. verapamil), diphenylalkylamines (e.g. fendiline), and benzothiazepines (e.g. diltiazem), inhibit CaV1.2 activity. Several Ca channel activators (CCA), e.g. Bay K 8644 and FPL 64176, activate CaV1.2 [23]. CaV1.2 is strongly modulated by phosphorylation via b2-adrenergic receptorinduced increase in cAMP level and PKA activation, which is terminated by PP2A [24]. This b2-AR pathway has an important role in sympathetic nerve-induced positive chronotropy and inotropy invoked during “ﬁght-or-ﬂight” response of the heart. CaV1.2 and its auxiliary subunits are associated with inherited (Timothy syndrome- LQT8, see Chap. 21) and acquired cardiac arrhythmias. Calmodulin and CaMKII that regulate the activity of L-type Ca channels are suggested to contribute to arrhythmogenesis [25]. CaV1.3 (a1D, L-type Ca channel, Gene - CACNA1D, 2181 aa) is expressed in SAN, AVN, Purkinje ﬁbers and right atrial cells [26–28]. CaV1.3 is reported to have

10

two auxiliary subunits, b and a2d. The macroscopic ICaV1.3 has activation V0.5 À12.9 mV and t 0.5–2.5 ms and inactivation V0.5 À42.7 mV and t 3.8–74 ms [29]. It contributes to normal pacemaking in SAN and is implicated in SAN
dysfunction [26, 27, 30]. Channel phosphorylation following b2-AR stimulation brings about positive chronotropy accounting for part of the effects of increased
sympathetic discharge. The CCBs and CCAs have profound effects on CaV1.3. CaV2.3 (a1E, R-type Ca channel, Gene - CACNA1E, 2270 aa, 20 pS) is asso-
ciated with b and a2d subunits. CaV2.3 channel allows the ﬂow of a residual inward Ca current (ICa,R) at high membrane voltages when ICa,L is blocked by CCBs. The macroscopic ICa,R has an activation V0.5 of À29 mV, t 2.4 ms, and inactivation V0.5 of À54 mV and t 16–655 ms [22]. CaV2.3 is expressed in atrial cells [31]. It is insensitive to CCBs and CCAs and is inhibited by Ni2+ and Cd2+ [22].
CaV3.1 (a1G, T-type Ca channel, Gene - CACNA1G, 2377 aa, 7.3 pS) is expressed predominantly in the conduction system, viz. SAN, AVN and Purkinje
ﬁbres [32]. CaV3.1 elicits ICa,T, a transient inward Ca current activated at low (more negative) membrane voltages, suggested to play a key role in the pacemaker
activity of SAN and in AVN conduction [27, 32]. The macroscopic ICa,T exhibits activation V0.5 À50 mV, t 1–7 ms, inactivation V0.5 À68 mV, and t 15–40 ms [33]. CaV3.1 is insensitive to CCBs and CCAs and is blocked by Ni and mibefradil [22, 34].
CaV3.2 (a1H, T-type Ca channel, gene - CACNA1H, 2353 aa, 9.1 pS) are most abundant in the conduction system of heart and are not expressed in adult mammalian ventricles [32, 35]. The macroscopic ICaV3.2 shows activation V0.5 of À41.9 mV and t of 2–10 ms. The inactivation V0.5 is in the range of À50.9 mV and t of 20–120 ms [22]. ICaV3.2 is inhibited by mibefradil, Ni, pimozol, and anandamide [22, 34]. CaV3.2 is re-expressed in atria and ventricles during cardiac pathologies like HF and cardiac hypertrophy and associated ventricular arrhythmias [32, 36].

1.3.3 Voltage-Gated K Channels (KV)
K channels contribute to maintenance of resting membrane potential and repolarisation of cardiac APs and, therefore, determine excitability, AP duration, and refractoriness of myocardium. K channels are the most diverse groups of ion channels encoded by about 70 genes in mammals and include six TM voltagegated (Kv), 6/7 TM Ca- and Na-activated (KCa, KNa), two TM inwardly-rectifying (Kir), and two pore (K2p) K channel families [22].
Voltage-gated potassium channels (VGPCs) are the largest family of K channels encoded by 40 genes in human genome and are, therefore, extremely diverse. VGPCs are comprised of a primary pore-forming a-subunit each with six TM segments. a-subunits co-assemble to form a homo- or hetero-tetramer that has the pore for K+ ﬂux, selectivity ﬁlter, voltage sensor, activation and inactivation gates, and sites for action of pharmacological agents. Presently 12 subfamilies of VGPCs are identiﬁed and are named, KV1.x–KV12.x.

1 Cardiac Ion Channels and Heart Rate and Rhythm

11

The members of KV5.x, KV6.x, KV8.x, and KV9.x form “modiﬁers” and are nonfunctional ion channels upon formation of homotetramers. Auxiliary b-subunits, KVb1.x, KVb2.x, and KVb3.x, and other associated proteins are also identiﬁed for several VGPCs and modulate their functions.
KV1.1 (Gene - KCNA1, 495 aa, 10 pS) is associated with two heteromeric poreforming subunits, KVb1 and KVb2 [22]. KV1.1 mediates an outward IK contributing to delayed rectiﬁer K current which maintains the resting potential and cellular
excitability [37, 38]. The kinetics of macroscopic IKV1.1 is characterised by activation V0.5 of À29.7 mV and t 15.5 ms, and inactivation V0.5 À47 mV and t 83.4 ms [37]. SA node is reported to over-express KV1.1 in mice exhibiting chronic bradycardia [39].
KV1.2 (Gene - KCNA2, 499 aa, 14–18 pS) has two heteromeric pore-forming units, KVb1 and KVb2, and co-assembles with other KV channels. The outward IKV1.2 contributes to delayed rectiﬁer IK and restores resting potential and excitability [40, 41]. The macroscopic IKV1.2 has activation V0.5 of 5–27 mV and t of 6 ms, and inactivation V0.5 of À15 mV [41]. It is expressed in SAN, atria, and ventricles [42] and is associated with right ventricular hypertrophy [43].
KV1.4 (Gene - KCNA4, 653 aa, 5 pS) forms heteromeric pore with KVb and coassembles with other KV channels. They are expressed in SAN, AVN, Purkinje ﬁbres, and ventricles [38, 44–47]. KV1.4 is responsible for the slow transient outward K current, Ito,s, involved in early repolarisation that shapes the conﬁguration of APs in different types of heart cells [48, 49] and is altered in post-myocardial
infarction (MI) ventricular myocardium in a differential manner [50]. KV1.4 is associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF) [49, 55].
KV1.5 (Gene - KCNA5, 613 aa, 8 pS) forms heteromeric channel with KVb1 and KVb2. It is expressed in SAN, AVN, atria, and ventricles, being more predominant in atria [38, 44, 51, 52] and is a major contributor to ultra-rapidly activating delayed
rectiﬁer outward K current (IKur). The macroscopic IKv1.5 shows activation V0.5 of À14 mV and t of 23 ms which are in the range of those for IKur. IKur participates in repolarisation and maintenance of resting potential [53, 54]. KV1.5 expression levels and IKur are associated with cardiac rhythm disorders like atrial ﬁbrillation (AF; see Chap. 33) and with ventricular hypertrophy [54, 55].
KV1.7 (Gene - KCNA7, 456 aa, 21 pS) co-assembles with other KV1 channels. It is expressed in heart [56] and is responsible for an IKur like current. The macroscopic IKV1.7 has activation V0.5 of À4.3 mV and inactivation V0.5 of À21 mV and t of 181.8 ms [57]. KV1.7 is suggested to contribute signiﬁcantly to IKur and facilitates repolarisation. KCNA7 is considered a candidate gene for inherited
cardiac disorders [58].
KV1.8 (Gene - KCNA10, 511 aa, 11 pS) co-assembles with other members of KV1 and KCNA4B acts as a novel b subunit of this channel to form a heteromeric channel [59]. KV1.8 is activated by cGMP and not by cAMP [60]. KV1.8 is expressed in heart, contributes to IKur, and facilitates repolarisation and restoration of resting potential and has a potential role in acquired arrhythmias [60, 61].
KV2.1 (Gene - KCNB1, 858 aa, 8 pS) is associated with several “modiﬁer” heteromeric pore-forming subunits, viz. KV5.1, KV6.1–KV6.3, KV8.1, and

12

O.N. Tripathi

KV9.1–KV9.3. Expression level of KV2.1 is high in ventricles and atria [47, 52]. KV2.1 causes a delayed rectiﬁer outward current IK,slow2 and contributes signiﬁcantly to IKur, facilitating repolarisation [47, 66]. It is associated with arrhythmias and left ventricular remodelling [47, 62].
KV3.4 (Gene - KCNC4, 635 aa, 14 pS) co-assembles with heteromeric poreforming subunit MiRP2. It is expressed in Purkinje ﬁbres and ventricles [52, 63] and mediates a K outward current that facilitates repolarisation. KV3.4 is associated with conduction abnormalities in congestive HF [63].
KV4.1 (Gene - KCND1, 647 aa, 6 pS) forms heteromeric pore with KChiP1 and DPPX [22]. It is differentially expressed in heart [45, 64].
KV4.2 (Gene - KCND2, 630 aa, 7.5 pS) forms heteromeric pore with the subunits KchIP1, 2, 3, and 4 and KVb. It is asymmetrically expressed in heart and is localised in the T-tubules in ventricles [65]. KV4.2 contributes to Ito,f and participates in repolarisation during phase 1 of cardiac AP [49]. However, its expression level is low in the ventricles of higher mammals allowing appearance of prominent notch phase of AP [66]. KV4.2 is implicated in diabetic cardiomyopathy [67, 68].
KV4.3 (Gene - KCND3, 655 aa, 5 pS) is associated with KChIP2, a heteromeric pore-forming subunit. KV4.3 is expressed in heart with profound differences in regional distribution and between different species [66, 69]. It also mediates a transient outward K current and contributes to Ito,f which determines AP duration in different types of heart cells. KV4.3 is associated with several cardiac rhythm disorders [49, 68, 70, 71].
KV7.1 (KvLQT1, Gene - KCNQ1, 676 aa; 5.8 pS) has several auxiliary subunits, viz. MinK (KCNE1), and MiRP1–MiRP4 [72]. It is expressed in atria and ventricles and mediates the slowly activating delayed rectiﬁer outward K current, IKs, contributing to repolarisation during the “plateau” phase of the AP [73]. Mutation in KV7.1 is the most common cause of LQT syndrome [74] and, very rarely, SQT syndrome ([75, 76]- see Chap. 23) and is associated with AF (see Chap. 27).
KV11.1 (Gene - KCNH2 or HERG, 1159 aa; 12 pS) is proposed to co-assemble with the accessory subunit MiRP1 [77].They are abundantly and asymmetrically expressed in SAN, atria and ventricles [78, 79]. KV11.1 channel underlies the rapidly activating delayed rectiﬁer outward K current, IKr, having strong inwardly rectifying properties [79]. IKr determines the time course of later phase of repolarisation of AP. hERG channels are associated with both inherited (LQT and SQT) and acquired (drug-induced) arrhythmias [79]. A number of chemically unrelated drugs and several of those intended for non-cardiac use are reported to block hERG channel causing ventricular arrhythmias, torsades de pointes (TDP), and sudden cardiac death (SCD) (see Chaps. 34 and 35).

1.3.4 Ca- and Na-Activated K Channels (KCa/KNa)
Five families of KCa channels (including KNa channels), namely, KCa1.x, KCa2.x, KCa3.x, KCa4.x, and KCa5.x have been identiﬁed [22]. The KCa channels, activated

1 Cardiac Ion Channels and Heart Rate and Rhythm

by intracellular Ca, are also grouped as small conductance (SK), intermediate conductance (IK), and big conductance (BK) channels on the basis of their conductance and pharmacological sensitivity. KCa1.x has one member, i.e. KCa1.1 (BK, slo1), and belongs to BK group. KCa5.x also has one member (KCa5.1, slo3) and is related to KCa1.x. KCa2.x has three members, viz. KCa2.1, KCa2.2, and KCa2.3, and belongs to SK group. KCa3.1 is the only member of KCa3.x (IK) group.
The Na-activated K (KNa) channels are named KCa4.x by IUPHAR and have two members, i.e. KCa4.1 (slack, slo2.2) and KCa4.2 (slick, slo2.1).The KCa4.x channels are activated by intracellular Na and not Ca.
The following KCa and KNa channels are reported to be expressed in heart. KCa2.1 (SK1, Gene - KCNN1, 543 aa, 9.2 pS) is formed of six TM segments, and calmodulin serves as its auxiliary subunit. They are activated by intracellular Ca and are voltage-dependent. KCa2.1 is reported in atria and ventricles [80], and is blocked by apamin and leiurotoxin I [22, 81]. KCa2.2 (SK2, Gene - KCNN2, 579 aa, 9.5 pS) has no auxiliary subunits and is present in heart its expression being higher in atria than in ventricles [82–84]. KCa2.2 is voltage-independent and facilitates repolarisation in atrial cells; their deletion in mice results in AF [84]- See also Chap. 33. Apamin and leiurotoxin I are its pore blockers [22, 81]. KCa2.3 (SK3, Gene - KCNN3, 731 aa) is voltage-independent, and no auxiliary subunits are reported. KCa2.3 is expressed in atria and ventricles [83] with a role in AF (See Chap. 27). Apamin and leiurotoxin I are its pore blockers [22, 81]. KCa4.2 (Slick/Slo2.1/KNa, Gene - KCNT2, 1138 aa, 141 pS [85], and 220 pS [86]). First reported in guinea pig ventricular myocytes, these channels are ubiquitously distributed [87]. KNa channels in ventricular myocytes show complex bursting behaviour [86] with several stable subconductance levels [88]. KCa4.2 is reported to form heteromers with KCa4.1 in neurones [89]. KCa4.2 channels are believed to protect from hypoxic insults [90]. They are blocked by several antiarrhythmic drugs [91] and activated (Slo2.1) by niﬂumic acid [92].

1.3.5 Leak K Channels (K2P/4 TM)
Leak K channels in part mediate a background leak of K across the SL, and maintain the membrane potential to subthreshold resting levels, thus modulating cellular excitability [93, 94]. The primary pore-forming a-subunits of these K channels have two pores formed with four TM segments arranged usually as homodimers or heterodimers. Fifteen types of K2P channels have been identiﬁed [22]. K2P channels remain open in the range of resting potential and carry time- and voltage-independent outward K currents. A variety of factors are known to modulate the activity of K2P channels, including temperature, pO2, pH, lipids, neurotransmitters, G-protein-coupled receptors, and mechanical stimuli.
The cardiac K2P family members underlie K currents somewhat similar to the “plateau current” and steady-state K current, ISS [94, 95], and are described below:

O.N. Tripathi

K2P1.1 (TWIK-1, Gene - KCNK1, 336 aa, 34 pS) is expressed more abundantly in ventricles and Purkinje ﬁbres than in atria [96, 97]. These channels conduct an inwardly rectifying outward K current and have been implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. Brugada syndrome and right ventricular arrhythmia [71].
K2P2.1 (TREK-1, Gene - KCNK2, 426 aa, 100 pS) [98, 99] is a TWIK-related channel and is expressed differentially in the three layers of left ventricle, being higher in epicardium than in endocardium [93]. It is present in longitudinal stripes in SL of ventricular myocytes [99]. K2P2.1 channel underlies an outward K current with weak inward rectiﬁcation and exhibits mechano-sensitivity [99]. The transmural gradient of K2P2.1 has been proposed to contribute to AP duration and dispersion of repolarisation [93, 99].
K2P3.1 (TASK-1, Gene - KCNK3, 394 aa, 14 pS) is a TWIK-related acidsensitive K channel that is expressed strongly in heart. The outward K current mediated by these channels facilitates repolarisation [98, 100]. K2P3.1 level in left ventricular mycocytes is increased in experimental Left ventricular hypertrophy [62]. ITASK-1 is suggested to mediate a1-adrenergic receptor-mediated prolongation of cardiac repolarisation that is inhibited by A293 [100].

1.3.6 Inwardly Rectifying K Channels (2 TM)
The inwardly rectifying K channels allow larger inward currents at potentials negative to EK than outward currents positive to EK. They are comprised of pore-forming two TM a-subunits, Kir, which form homotetramers although some members also form heterotetramers. Seven subfamilies of Kir channels have been identiﬁed: Kir1.x–Kir7.x. Kir2.x families have four subfamilies, Kir2.1–Kir2.4, and their inwardly rectifying K currents contribute signiﬁcantly to IK1 [101]. Kir3.x family has four channel types identiﬁed as Kir3.1, Kir3.2, Kir3.3, and Kir3.4, also called GIRK1, GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4, respectively. The Kir3 channels are coupled to G-proteins. Kir6.x (KATP) family has two members, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2. Functional Kir6.x channels form heteromultimers of octameric conformation with four auxiliary subunits, the sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) that serve as binding sites for glibenclamide and diazoxide.
The following Kir family members are expressed in heart. Kir2.1 (IRK1, Gene - KCNJ2, 427 aa, 21 pS) has a higher expression in ventricles than in atria. Other Kir2.x members and Kir4.1 serve as its heteromeric poreforming domain. Kir2.1 channel K outward current is the major contributor to IK1 and contributes to the repolarisation phase of the AP and maintenance of resting potential in ventricles and atria [102, 103]. KV2.1 is associated with several rhythm disorders, including AF, left ventricular hypertrophy, and Andersen–Tawil syndrome (LQT7) [62, 63, 104] and SQT3 (see Chap. 23). Kir2.2 (IRK2, Gene - KCNJ12, 433 aa, 34.2 pS) is expressed in ventricles and atria [22, 102, 105]. Kir2.1 serves as a heteromeric pore-forming subunit for Kir2.2. K outward current due to Kir2.2 contributes partly to IK1 and facilitates repolarisation of AP and maintenance of resting potential [102].

Kir2.3 (IRK3, Gene - KCNJ4, 445 aa, 13 pS) forms complexes with other Kir2.x subunits [22, 106–108]. It also contributes to IK1 and thus to repolarisation phase and resting potential. Kir2.3 is associated with several types of cardiac arrhythmias including Andersen’s syndrome [101, 107].
Kir3.1 (GIRK1, Gene - KCNJ3, 501 aa, 42 pS) is abundant in SA node, AV node, and atria [109, 110]. Kir3.1 is electrically silent and forms functional heteromers with the pore-forming subunits, Kir3.2, Kir3.3, or Kir3.4 with virtually identical conductances, kinetics, and Gbg sensitivities [110]. M2R stimulation leads to Gbg-mediated activation of heteromeric Kir3.1 channel causing an outward K current (IKACh), which brings about SA nodal cellular hyperpolarisation, AV conduction delay, atrial hyperpolarisation, and negative chronotropy [111].
Kir3.2 (GIRK2. Gene - KCNJ6, 423 aa, 30 pS) is primarily a brain-type channel but its splice variants are also reported in SA node and atria [112]. Kir3.2 is activated by M2R-mediated Gbg and RGS4 pathways, and induces IKACh causing bradycardia due to hyperpolarisation of SAN cells [112].
Kir3.4 (GIRK4, Gene - KCNJ5, 419 aa, 15–30 pS) can form homomeric channels but usually forms heteromers with Kir3.1, Kir3.2, and Kir3.3. It assembles in heart as heterotetramers with Kir3.1 [113]. The Kir3.4/Kir3.1 heteromeric channels are strongly activated by Gbg subunits of G protein that mediate the M2 receptor stimulation by ACh resulting in activation of IKACh [110]. A decrease in IKACh prevents, while its increase favours occurrence of AF in GIRK4 K/O mice [54, 114–116]. It is,
therefore, suggested that IKACh has a potential role in clinical AF ([117], Chap. 33). Kir6.1 (KATP, Gene - KCNJ8, 424 aa, 33 pS) forms heteromultimeric complex
with four auxiliary subunits, SUR2B. These channels are activated by low (<10À5 M) concentrations of intracellular ATP but inhibited by its higher (>10À4 M) concentrations [118]. Kir6.1 channels are reported in atria and ventricles, are distributed in the sarcolemma of cardiac myocytes and are associated with
cardiac maladaptive remodelling [119].
Kir6.2 (KATP, Gene - KCNJ11, 390 aa, 79 pS) forms heteromultimers with SUR2A in heart and causes the repolarising IKATP [120]. Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits predominate in the sarcolemma of ventricular and atrial myocytes [121].
While Kir6.2 is the K channel, SUR2A acts as the sensor for intracellular ATP and ADP levels and modulates the activity of the former, thereby determining the
amplitude of IKATP, membrane potential, and APD. KATP channels play important roles in normal myocardial function and in several acquired and inherited cardiac
disorders, viz. AF, cardiomyopathy, HF, and poor adaptability to stress-induced
cardiac dysfunction [122]. The sarcolemmal Kir6.2/SUR2A is reported to facilitate
protection from ischemia–reperfusion cardiac injury [123].

1.3.7 Cyclic Nucleotide-Regulated Channels
Two groups of channels belong to the superfamily of cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels: (1) Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and (2) hyperpolarisationactivated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels [22].

16

O.N. Tripathi

CNG Channels: These cation channels are expressed as heterotetramers comprised of homologous six TM A subunits (CNGA1–CNGA4) with six TM B subunits (CNGB1 and CNGB3). A cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) located on the cytosolic C terminal serves as the site for activation by cAMP or cGMP. CNG channels are permeable to monovalent cations Na and K and also Ca.
CNGA2 (Gene - CNGA2, 664 aa, 35 pS) is expressed, though feebly, in myocardial sarcolemma [124]. CNGA2 is permeable to Ca2+ but its physiological signiﬁcance is unknown.
HCN channels: Four types of HCN channels, HCN1–HCN4, are identiﬁed in cardiac and neuronal tissues [125]. HCN channels are homo- or hetero-tetramers of subunits comprised of six TM segments, S1–S6, with S4 acting as the voltage sensor. The four monomeric subunits are arranged around a central pore lined by their S6 TM segments. The N and C termini of the subunits are cytosolic, the latter having a crucial role in channel regulation by cAMP. A cyclic nucleotide-binding domain on the C terminus serves as the binding site for cAMP and has a key role in the channel activity. Membrane potentials in the hyperpolarised range (negative to resting potential) activate these channels. HCN channels are permeable to monovalent cations, K and Na, which upon channel opening carry an inward depolarising cation current, contributing to funny (If) or hyperpolarising (Ih) currents. If contributes signiﬁcantly to diastolic depolarisation in the pacemaker cells of SAN, AVN and Purkinje ﬁbers and modulates heart rate and rhythm. Therefore, HCN channels are often called “pacemaker channels”. Sympathetic neurotransmitters, epinephrine and norepinephrine, stimulate the activity of HCN channels through b2 AR-mediated increase in intracellular cAMP level and induce positive chronotropy. The parasympathetic neurotransmitter, ACh, is reported to cause negative chronotropy partly by inhibiting HCN channel activity. Several speciﬁc blockers of If (bradycardiac agents) have been discovered, exempliﬁed by ivabradine, offering new therapeutic agents to treat sinus tachycardias.
HCN1 (Gene - HCN1, 890 aa, 12.9 pS) is expressed feebly in SAN and embryonic ventricular myocytes [22, 125]. MiRP1 serves as an auxiliary subunit.
HCN2 (Gene - HCN2, 889 aa, 1.5–35 pS) is also expressed in SAN and is considered to be complimentary to HCN4. HCN2 channels contribute up to 20% to If current in mice SAN cells [125, 126]. HCN2 channels are permeable to Na and K. Dysfunction of HCN2 is associated with sinus dysrhythmia [126].
HCN4 (Gene - HCN4, 1203 aa, 17.5 pS) is expressed predominantly in SAN [127]. MiRP1 is a potential auxiliary subunit. HCN4 has an activation V0.5 of À82 mV and t of ~2 s when expressed in HEK293 cells [22]. HCN4 contributes up to 80% to If in SAN. HCN4 is associated with sick sinus syndrome and other disorders of SAN and AVN and has also been implicated in AF, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and HF [128–131].
The HCN channels are extensively covered in Chaps. 3 and 5. Mathematical modeling of the role of HCN channels in pacemaker activity of SAN cells is also covered extensively in Chaps. 2 and 8.

1.3.8 Transient Receptor Potential Channels

The mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel superfamily is comprised of six protein families, the classical TRP (TRPC), vallinoid receptor (TRPV), melastatin (TRPM), mucolipin (TRPML), polycystin (TRPP), and ankyrin (TRPA1) protein channels. TRP channel subunits are formed of six TM a helical segments (S1–S6), the loop between S5 and S6 making the pore. Although S4 in these ion channels lacks classical voltage sensors several members of TRP family show voltage-dependent gating [133, 171]. Most of the TRP channels are nonselectively cation permeant, except TRPV5 and TRPV6 which are Ca selective, and TRPM4 and TRPM5 which are monovalent cation selective. TRP channels when in open state allow increase in cytosolic Ca and Na concentrations and depolarise the cell; they are also considered to act as store-operated Ca channels (SOCCs), contribute to cellular Ca homeostasis and are implicated in SAN automaticity and hypertrophy [132, 167]. Several TRP channels are activated by stretch and contribute to mechano-electrical feedback. Chapter 31 covers TRP channels.

1.3.9 Chloride Channels
The chloride channels are functionally and structurally diverse with ubiquitous distribution both on the plasma membrane as well as on intracellular organelles [134, 135, 171]. A surge of research on Cl channels during the past decade has led to identiﬁcation of a large variety of these anion channels and their prospective roles in various cellular functions in health and disease. As a consequence Cl channels are emerging as important targets for new drug discovery for a number of diseases. The mammalian Cl channels identiﬁed so far are grouped into ﬁve families: Voltagesensitive Cl channels (ClC), Cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR), Ca-activated Cl channels (CaCC), Maxi Cl channels (Maxi Cl), and Volume-regulated Cl channels (VRC, VRAC) [171].
Several types of Cl channels have been described in heart cells, and their special features and roles in cardiac activity are well described in a recent review [134]. Some salient features of these channels and their relevance to cardiac electrical activity and heart rate and rhythm are discussed below.
ClC-2 channels are responsible for a voltage-activated inwardly rectifying chloride current, ICl,ir, and are likely to contribute to cell swelling. CLC-2 is expressed in SAN pacemaker cells, Purkinje ﬁbers and atrial and ventricular myocytes [135].
ClC-3 channels elicit a volume-regulated outwardly rectifying Cl current, ICl,vol, with two components, the swelling-activated one, ICl,swell, and basally activated one, ICl,b. ClC-1,-2, and -3 channels are expressed in atria and ventricles and ICl,Swell is reported in SAN, and atrial and ventricular myocytes [134, 136, 137]. ICl,Swell is stretch-sensitive and is thought to play a role in regulating membrane potential, APD, and excitability and has arrhythmogenic potentials [137]. They are implicated

18

O.N. Tripathi

in VF dynamics in isolated guinea pig heart and exert a protective role in cardiac hypertrophy and HF [138].
CFTR channels are expressed in atria and ventricles and give rise to slightly outwardly rectifying currents named after their activators, namely ICl,PKA, ICl,PKC, and ICl, ATP [139]. The cAMP/ PKA-induced current, ICl,PKA, was the ﬁrst Cl channel current recorded in heart cells. The PKC-activated current, ICl,PKC, has been recorded from ventricular myocytes [140–142]. The extracellular ATP-activated [134] CFTR current, ICl,ATP, has also been recorded from atria and ventricles. CFTR responsible for ICl,PKA are clustered on the z-groove but are not seen on the mouth of T-tubules [142]. ICFTR is associated with early afterdepolarizations (EAD) [137], is reported to modulate ventricular myocyte contraction rate and is associated with changes in HF [143]. An epicardium to endocardium gradient is suggested to exist for CFTR (ICl,PKA) which is lost in cardiac hypertrophy [144]. The channel is blocked by GaTx-1 and activated by nicorandil [145, 171].
CLCA-1 channel-mediated current, ICl,Ca, has been recorded from Purkinje ﬁbers and ventricular myocytes [146]. ICl,Ca has a role in determining membrane potential and membrane excitability in heart cells and contributes to Iti in addition to INCX (Fig. 1.3). An increase in ICl,Ca is reported to be associated with delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) in ventricular myocytes [146] and with left ventricular hypertrophy exhibiting APD prolongation, AP alternans, and T wave alternans, indicating a role of CLCA-1 in arrhythmogenesis [147].
Bestrophin, a member of CaCC group, has several homologues, expressed in a wide variety of cells including myocardium [134, 148] where Best-3 is more predominant than Best-1 and Best-2 [149]. mBest-3 is widely distributed in mouse heart and has a sarcolemmal localisation [149]. It is shown to have a putative pore domain and to function like a channel. The bestrophin-induced ICl,Ca is time- and voltage-independent and displays slight outward rectiﬁcation. It is inhibited by niﬂumic acid and DIDS [149, 171].
THEM16 (Anoctamin, ANO), another member of Ca-activated Cl channels, has 10 homologues, and THEM16A is expressed in heart [134, 150].
VDAC1, the voltage-dependent anion channel 1, having very high conductance (280–430 pS; [171]) and normally localised on the outer mitochondrial membrane in ventricular myocytes is also expressed on SL [134].
ICl,acid, activated by acidic extracellular pH [151], has also been reported in atrial and ventricular myocytes showing outward rectiﬁcation. Its activation is independent of [Ca2+]i. Since high extracellular pH increases APD and extracellular acidosis accompanies MI-induced arrhythmias it is likely that ICl,acid has a role in pathophysiology of such arrhythmias [152].

1.3.10 Stretch-Activated Channels
Mechano-sensitive (MSC), mechano-gated (MGC), or stretch-activated (SAC) channels are activated primarily by mechanical stress (mechanical tension) in the

1 Cardiac Ion Channels and Heart Rate and Rhythm

19

membrane [153]. Membrane cytoskeleton is considered to mediate the mechanical stress to the channel protein bringing about the required changes in channel conformation to induce channel opening. Although several members of VGIC and LGIC superfamilies do respond to mechanical stress they are not categorised as SACs. However, a few members of TRPC and K2P (TWIK) families indeed respond to primary mechanical stimulus and are, therefore, identiﬁed as SACs. In the strict sense of SACs no speciﬁc protein has yet been identiﬁed as a representative of these channels [153]. It is well recognised that mechano-electric feedback has important roles in the cardiac cycle and is involved in maintaining the heart rate and rhythm under physiological conditions and cardiac rhythm disturbances (see Chap. 7). The mechano-sensitive channels include TREK-1, TRPC1, and TRPV2. These SACs are implicated in AF, DADs, cardiomyopathy, and ventricular arrhythmia [99, 154].
Gadolinium and streptomycin inhibit the activity of SACs, but GsMTx4, a peptide isolated from tarantula venom, is a more speciﬁc blocker of SACs and inhibits stretch-induced AF [153].

1.3.11 Gap Junction Channels
The intercalated discs (ICD) on SL between adjacent cardiac myocytes connect the two neighbouring cells. Gap junction (GJ) channels are one of the three components of ICDs, the other two being fascia adherens and desmosomes, and provide electrical coupling between adjacent cells. GJ channels are composed of two hemichannels, each one, called connexons, inserted in the SL of two adjoining cells. Each connexon comprises of six domains of connexins arranged concentrically to form a central pore. The connexins themselves are made up of four TM segments, M1–M4 with their N and C termini located intracellularly. Two loops connecting M1 with M2 and M3 with M4 are extracellular, while an intracellular loop connects M2 to M3. Normally GJ channels are located at the terminal poles of myocardial cells and bring about cell-to-cell electrical coupling facilitating impulse conduction along cardiac ﬁbres. GJ channels allow passive diffusion of molecules <1 kDa, e.g. anions, cations, nutrients, metabolites, and second messengers (IP3). Connexins, e.g. Cx43, have a short half-life that may have implications in myocardial excitability [155].
GJ channels are named after their constituent connexin (Cx) followed by numerals that denote its molecular weight, e.g. Cx40 meaning connexin of 40 kDa. Twenty one connexins are expressed in humans, only a few being expressed in heart, viz. Cx30, Cx30.2, Cx 40, Cx43, and Cx 45 [156, 157]. Cx30 and Cx30.2 are expressed in SAN center and contribute to regulation of pacemaker activity and heart rate [156, 158]. Cx40 is expressed in Purkinje ﬁbers, SAN periphery and atria [155–157, 159]. Cx43 is a ventricular-speciﬁc protein and is also expressed in atria and the periphery of SAN [156, 157]. Cx45 is expressed in AVN and is reported in the SAN center. Cx30.2, Cx40, and Cx45 are expressed in AVN and His-bundle and contribute differentially to supra-Hisian and infra-Hisian impulse conduction in mice, as evident from ECG changes in Cx30.2/ Cx40 deﬁcient animals [159].

O.N. Tripathi

Connexins play a key role in impulse conduction in the entire heart maintaining speciﬁc regional conduction requirements necessary for a co-ordinated cardiac contraction underlying normal heart rate. Alterations in expression pattern of speciﬁc connexins herald several cardiac rhythm disorders including AF (see Chap. 27), ischemia–reperfusion injury, and congestive heart failure (CHF) [63].
Chapter 28 provides an account of GJ channels in cardiac disorders. Chapter 29 discusses the role of connexins in ischemia–reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.

1.4 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Ion Channels
SR membrane is endowed with the capability of contributing to ﬁne maintenance of cytosolic free Ca ion concentration and to make free Ca available at strategic locations necessary for performance of cellular functions. To this end, the SR membrane possesses two major types of Ca release channels, ryanodine receptor channels (RyR) and inositol triphosphate receptor channels (InsP3R). The SR membrane Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) takes up excess Ca from cytosol and ﬁlls the SR Ca stores. This topic is covered in Chap. 17.

1.4.1 Ryanodine Receptor Channels
The RyRs are ubiquitously distributed. Three types of RyRs have been identiﬁed, namely RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, which represent large (~558 kDa) structurally related tetrameric membrane-spanning proteins, which co-assemble with four calstabin (FKBP12) proteins [160, 171]. The RyR channels form a mushroom-like structure and bulk of their protein lies on the cytosolic surface of SR. Signiﬁcant advances have been made in resolving the pore structure of RyRs using highresolution cryo-electron microscopy [161]. RyR2, the main cardiac Ca release channel, plays a key role in E–C coupling by releasing required amount of Ca in the cytosol following SL inﬂux of Ca through CaV1.2 channels localised in T-tubules (Fig. 1.2). RyR2 and RyR3 are also expressed in SAN and Purkinje ﬁbre cells, contributing to the pacemaker activity of the former [162, 163], and impulse conduction in the latter, thereby contributing to regulation of heart rate and rhythm. RyR2 is implicated in several acquired and inherited cardiac rhythm disorders, e.g. arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), CPVT, AF, and abnormal sinus rhythm [164, 165]. It is suggested that changes in RyR2 in the His-Purkinje system underlie CPVT [163].
RyR2 channels are blocked by ryanodine, dantrolene, ruthenium red, tetracaine, and lidocaine and are activated by caffeine. Treatability of CPVT-like condition by tetracaine in mice shows that RyR2 is a promising target for developing novel antiarrhythmic drugs [163, 166].

1 Cardiac Ion Channels and Heart Rate and Rhythm

21

Chapter 21 gives an account of the role of RyR2 in CPVT and Chapter 4 describes the role of RyRs in the pacemaker activity of SA node.

1.4.2 SR Inositol Triphosphate Receptor Channels
Out of several isoforms of InsP3R, heart expresses InsP3R2, a 300 kDa protein that coassembles to form a tetrameric channel. InsP3R2 is expressed in atria, ventricles, and Purkinje ﬁbres albeit at lower density than RyR2. InsP3R2 is suggested to ﬁne tune the perinuclear Ca and activate CaMKII to modulate transcription mechanisms of nucleus [169, 173]. Such a role of InsP3R2 in excitation–transcription coupling may be involved in gene expression alterations during cardiac disorders like ventricular hypertrophy and HF. RyR2 and InsP3R2 have distinct functions to perform in heart and modulate heart rhythm via altogether different mechanisms (see Chap. 17).
1.5 Mitochondrial and Nuclear Channels
Mitochondria serve as the energy centre of heart cells and also regulate cardiac electrical activity by modulating the SL ion channel kinetics. The mitochondrial membranes express several ion channels with crucial roles in the normal and pathological cardiac activity including arrhythmogenesis [168]. Given below are some of the predominant mitochondrial and nuclear ion channels (see also Chap. 17).
KCa1.1 (Slo, BK, Gene - KCNMA1, 1182 aa, 200–220 pS) has Slack as its heteromeric pore-forming subunit and b1–b4 serve as auxiliary subunits [22]. It is activated both by voltage and intracellular Ca and is blocked by TEA, charybdotoxin, and iberiotoxin. KCa1.1 is expressed in inner mitochondrial membrane in heart and plays a signiﬁcant role in myocardial energetics. Openers of KCa1.1 are reported to protect the ventricles from ischemia–reperfusion injury and open the possibilities of developing new drug for treatment of cardiac disorders [168].
Kir6.1, Kir6.2 (KATP), and SUR2A subunits are expressed in mitochondria and are associated with protection from ischemia–reperfusion injuries [123].
Voltage-dependent anion channels, VDAC, are expressed prominently in mitochondrial outer membrane.
The nucleus in cardiomyocytes serves as the seat of transcription and the nuclear membrane and nucleoplasmic reticulum have key roles in excitation–transcription coupling [169]. Both the nuclear membrane and the nucleoplasmic reticulum express several ion channels, including RyR, InsP3R, R-type Ca channels, and K channels [170] (see Sec. 1.4.2 and Chap. 17).

1.6 Conclusions

O.N. Tripathi

Our present knowledge of the molecular basis of electrical activity of heart owes greatly to the analytical approach in identifying the ion channels and other transport proteins expressed at mRNA and protein levels in the sarcolemma of different types of heart cells. The roles of SR, mitochondrial and nuclear membrane ion transport proteins in cardiac cellular activity during normal and abnormal cardiac rhythm are also better understood now. Future research on analytical and integrative aspects of “ion channels, ion transporters, signaling cascades, mechanical function, energy metabolism, transcription, translation and targeting” [173] (Fig. 1.2) is expected to provide a better picture of the molecular basis of ionic mechanisms underlying electrical activity during a cardiac cycle in health and disease. Because most of the studies on cardiac ion channels in SR, mitochondria and nucleus have been carried out on ventricular myocytes the need for research on these aspects of cells from other regions of heart cannot be overemphasized. An important problem, however, concerns differences in the ion channel compliments of the same type of cardiac tissue in different mammalian species limiting extrapolation of data from laboratory animals to humans. It is hoped that future research will overcome this issue by identifying the entire compliment of human cardiac ion channel signature and also establish their role in arrhythmias including channelopathies. The other problem concerns reported disparities between the ion channel mRNA and protein expression levels in different regions of heart and functional aspects of the expressed channel proteins. Thus, for example, we do not yet fully know about the molecular components of all the ionic currents recorded in different types of heart cells in higher mammals, including humans, let alone their precise contributions to AP conﬁguration and ECG waveform. Ongoing research is expected to provide a better understanding of these important aspects. This will also help identiﬁcation and validation of new target molecules that could be explored, by employing the newly developed ion channel-high throughput screening (HTS) and related technologies, for discovery of novel and better antiarrhythmic drugs (see Chap. 35).

Chapter 2
Ionic Basis of the Pacemaker Activity of SA Node Revealed by the Lead Potential Analysis
Yukiko Himeno, Chae Young Cha, and Akinori Noma

2.1 Introduction
The ionic mechanisms underlying SA node pacemaker activity have been discussed for decades based on ﬁndings of voltage clamp experiments using the isolated single pacemaker cells as well as the SA node tissue preparation. It is now well established that there is no single “pacemaker current,” instead multiple ion channels and electrogenic ion transporter currents generate the pacemaker potential. Thus, although technically challenging, the key issue is to clarify the quantitative as well as qualitative role of individual ionic currents in the pacemaker potential generation. In experiments, a given current of interest is often blocked or depressed using a channel-speciﬁc drug. The interpretation of the results or quantitative measure of the contribution is largely interfered with secondary changes in other current systems via modiﬁed time course of membrane potential change or ionic concentrations within a cell. This difﬁculty is largely solved by the recent progress in developing the electrophysiological cardiac cell model. Indeed the pacemaker activity has been well reproduced by a variety of mathematical cell models which integrate experimental ﬁndings [1].
In this chapter, we will introduce an analytical tool, the lead potential (VL) analysis, to estimate the quantitative contribution of each ionic current and ion exchanger to the pacemaker potential based on mathematical SA node cell models. We will apply this new method to six mathematical models published by Wilders et al. [2], Demir et al. [3], Kurata et al. [4], Sarai et al. [5], Himeno et al. [6] and Maltsev and Lakatta [7]. This analysis allows us to indicate common mechanisms

shared by all these models. Further analyses are used to clarify the reasons for discrepancies between these models.

2.2 The Lead Potential (VL) Analysis
The concept of the VL analysis has recently been reﬁned to measure the contribution of individual currents to changes in membrane potential [8]. To facilitate understanding of this method, we ﬁrst explain the preliminary version of the method introduced by Sarai et al. (2003) [5] before describing the latest version.

2.2.1 The Primary Concept of VL

The ionic mechanisms underlying the spontaneous action potential in SA node cells
can be explained as follows. The rising phase of the action potential is mainly due to the rapid activation of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL). A positive feedback mechanism is well established that the depolarization by the activation of inward ICaL causes more activation of ICaL itself, culminating in the overshoot potential. The resulting membrane depolarization and Ca2+ inﬂux causes inactivation of ICaL and activation of the delayed rectiﬁer K+ currents (IKr and IKs), which together promotes repolarization of the cell to the maximum diastolic potential. Then, the negative
potential progressively deactivates IKr and IKs in the presence of background inward currents, resulting in the gradual depolarization during the early diastolic period
that ﬁnally triggers the next action potential through the activation of ICaL. The slow diastolic depolarization is also inﬂuenced by Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current (INaCa) and Na+/K+ pump current (INaK) to an extent that depends on the concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ and Na+, respectively.
In general, the spontaneous changes of the membrane potential are generated by
variations in the conductances of individual channel currents by membrane poten-
tial, the chemical gating, or the intracellular ion concentrations, and also in the
transporter currents such as IPMCA and INaK. Accordingly, development of the VL analysis method started from reducing the membrane system consisting of more
than ten ion channels into a single whole cell membrane conductance (Gm). Irrespective of the conductance properties of each channel, Gm is deﬁned as a sum of the whole cell conductance of K+ (GK), Na+ (GNa), Ca2+ (GCa), and ClÀ (GCl) (Fig. 2.1a):

Here, Vm is membrane potential and Ex stands for reversal potential for ion X, which can be deﬁned by the Nernst equation. InetX, the whole cell net current for ion
X, is calculated according to the ion species irrespective of the passage through speciﬁc channel types. For example, the Ca2+, Na+, and K+ current components

through the L-type Ca2+ channel were involved in InetCa, InetNa, and InetCa, respectively. The Na+ and Ca2+ ﬂuxes through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger are included in InetNa and InetCa, since this ion exchange is driven by the passive electrochemical driving force like for the ion channel ﬂux. On the other hand, for the ion ﬂuxes through active transporter, such as INaK and IPMCA, are excluded from InetX because they are driven by the energy through ATP hydrolysis. In this sense, the electrical
property of the model can be reduced to an equivalent circuit consisting of a
capacitor, a single variable resistor, and a battery, as shown in Fig. 2.1b. The battery is deﬁned as a zero current potential E0, which satisﬁes the following equation:

InetK þ InetNa þ InetCa þ InetCl ¼ 0:

In the reduced circuit, the membrane current is driven by the difference between Vm and E0. Thus, the time-dependent change in Vm is given by,

dVm ¼ À Im ¼ À Gm Â ðVm À E0Þ :

dt

Cm

Cm

(2.8)

Equation (2.8) indicates that Vm always moves toward E0 with a time constant given by Cm/Gm. In Fig. 2.1c, the time course of E0 is superimposed on that of Vm. Indeed, E0 is always more positive than Vm during the depolarizing phase and vice versa during the hyperpolarizing phase. E0 continuously changes in the SA node cell and Vm crosses E0 when dVm/dt ¼ 0 at the maximum diastolic potential and at the peak of the action potential. In the ventricular myocyte model, Vm remains constant at the resting membrane potential, but once the action potential is trig-
gered, E0 changes in advance of Vm in the repolarizing phase. Since E0 leads the change in Vm, we named E0 as lead potential (VL).
Note that the spontaneous change in VL is caused by the time-dependent changes in the ion channel conductance or the time-dependent change in the electrogenic ion
pumps. If changes in these membrane conductances are all stopped, the time-
dependent changes in Vm level off at VL, and the spontaneous activity disappears. The nongating background ion currents scarcely contribute to the time-dependent
changes in VL because their conductance remains constant.

2.2.2 Contribution of Each Ionic Current Estimated Using the Primary VL Analysis
The application of the preliminary VL method to the Sarai et al. model [5], Wilders et al. model [2], and Demir et al. model [3] provided a clear general view of ionic mechanisms as compared in Fig. 2.2. In this method, p(o) of a given channel was

Fig. 2.2 Contribution of each current component to time-dependent changes in VL examined by the old VL analysis. (a) Sarai et al. model (Kyoto model), (b) Wilders et al. model, and (c) Demir et al. model. The thin trace is the Vm record and the thick trace is VL, which is calculated during the interval from the maximum diastolic potential to the beginning of the upstroke of the action potential. In calculating VL, the p(o) of indicated current was ﬁxed at the value obtained at the maximum diastolic potential
suddenly ﬁxed at the maximum diastolic potential. In all models, ﬁxation of p(o) of IKr almost suppresses the diastolic depolarization in VL, indicating that the timedependent deactivation of IKr is the basal mechanism to drive the slow diastolic depolarization. Fixing p(o) of ICaL results in a slight downward deﬂection of VL in the late diastolic phase, indicating that the activation of ICaL is responsible for initiating the next action potential. It is obvious that the deactivation of IKr and the activation of ICaL are the primary mechanism of the pacemaker depolarization in all three models.

38

Y. Himeno et al.

Differences among these three models are observed in the contributions of the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih, Iha, or If), the sustained inward current (Ist), and the T-type calcium current (ICaT). Fixing p(o) of these currents all hinders the slow diastolic depolarization, but the effects are rather small if compared to that of IKr in these three models. In this respect, these currents might be categorized as “supplemental” currents. Namely, ﬁxing p(o) of If is modest in the Sarai et al. model and Demir et al. model. On the other hand, ﬁxing p(o) of If in the Wilders model caused a signiﬁcant downward deﬂection throughout the diastolic depolarization as if it substitutes the effects of Ist in the Sarai et al. model or ICaT in the Demir et al. model. It is evident that the difference among currents in these three models is caused by the different experimental ﬁndings used for developing the model as described below.
ICaT is the low voltage-activated “transient” calcium current, but its window current acts as a sustained current in the Demir et al. model. Steady-state activation and inactivation curves in the two models are shown and compared in Fig. 2.3. In the Sarai et al. model, the description of the current is based on data obtained by Hagiwara et al. [9]. On the other hand, Demir et al. modeled the current based on experimental data obtained by Fermini and Nathan [10], whose inactivation was slower and occurred at more positive voltage range. It might be noted that the experimental data points suggest even larger window current than the activation curve used for ICaT modeling (Fig. 2.3a, right panel). In contrast, the fast inactivation kinetics hinders ICaT to exhibit an obvious contribution in the Sarai et al. model. These differences in the inactivation kinetics resulted in an obvious difference in the ICaT contributions between the two models. It should be ﬁnally clariﬁed if a different subgroup of cells in the SA node region or different experimental protocols caused different results in each study.
The Ist assumed in Sarai et al.’s model is not always used in other SA node modeling, but plays a substantial role in the pacemaker depolarization especially in the late phase of the depolarization (Fig. 2.2a). Ist is a sustained inward current, whose reversal potential ranged between þ10 and þ30 mV. It was ﬁrst reported by Guo et al. in rabbit [11] and then in guinea pig [12, 13] (Fig. 2.4), mouse [14] and rat [15]. Although its molecular basis is still unclear, the nicardipine sensitive single channel current as well as whole cell current has been recorded as shown in Fig. 2.4 [12, 13]. Furthermore, its physiological response to autonomic agonists is also observed in guinea pig [16]. Thus, there is no doubt about its existence in some population of SA node cells.

2.3 Sophistication of the VL Analysis
Although the original VL analysis enabled us to conclude which ionic channel has relatively large or small contribution to pacemaker activity, it was still intuitive and qualitative. The goal of improving the VL analysis method was to perform quantitative measurement of the contribution of individual current components during the

[S] is the concentration of ion S, and F, R, T and zs are the usual thermodynamic parameters. p(o) stands for the open probability of the channel, which is a time-
and voltage-dependent variable determined by Vm- and/or ligand-dependent gating of the channel. For example, pore block of the IK1 channel by polyamines or Mg2+ [17], or unspeciﬁed mechanisms underlying the rectifying properties of IKpl, was attributed to changes in p(o) in this VL analysis.
When aiming to quantitatively determine the contribution of ionic systems to the
pacemaker depolarization, neglecting nonlinearity of f(Vm) in the old VL method is a fatal error. The new VL method solves this problem by restricting the following argument only at the moment of observation (t ¼ tob). That is, f(Vm) can be described as a tangential line at t ¼ tob as follows:

f ðVmÞ ¼ f 0ðVmÞ Â ðVm À EÞ;

(2.12)

where E is the value of intersection of the tangential line with the voltage axis. Then, all the channel currents can be expressed in the common form of GXðVm À EXÞ, where

GX ¼ gmax Â pðoÞ:

in (2.10), and,

GX ¼ pmax Â pðoÞ Â f 0ðVmÞ

Until the derivation for (2.9)–(2.17), we ﬁxed all the time-dependent variables by the values at t ¼ tob. Now, if we consider Vm as a free variable, (2.15) corresponds to Fig. 2.1b. Therefore, Vm tends to approach VL with a time constant t at each time point. Figure 2.5a, b shows temporal changes of VL and Vm during an action potential in the SA node cell model [6] and ventricular myocyte model [17]
obtained by calculating (2.16) at every moment. Note that VL of the new version (Fig. 2.5a) is slightly different from the old one (Fig. 2.1c, left).

2.3.2 Estimation of Contributions of Each Ionic Component
According to Fig. 2.1b and (2.15), it can be interpreted that the automatic change of Vm is driven by the time-dependent change in VL, and t represents the passive

Here, we will calculate the extent to which a component of interest affects dVL/dt. To evaluate the contribution of a single component, we determine dVL_Fix/dt after eliminating its time-dependent change (i.e., G_ i ¼ 0, E_i ¼ 0, or I_i ¼ 0), leaving all the other components intact. We refer to this process of eliminating the timedependent change as “ﬁxing.” For example, when we ﬁx Gi, we set G_ i ¼ 0 in (2.18):

2.3.3 Contribution of Each Ionic Component to the Pacemaker Potential Quantiﬁed by the VL Analysis
Using the reﬁned VL method, the description of the contribution of each ionic component has been improved dramatically. Figure 2.6 shows the result of the VL

analysis performed on the same SA node model illustrated in Fig. 2.5a. Transition
of the relative contribution is shown along the time axis, and the mechanisms of
contribution are explained based on the time-dependent variations of p(o) and the current amplitude shown in Fig. 2.6b. The magnitude of dVL/dt remained nearly constant around 0.09 mV msÀ1 during the initial 200 ms after the maximum
diastolic potential and increased exponentially thereafter, as shown in Fig. 2.6a.
At the beginning of depolarization, dVL/dt is largely determined by the deactivation of the outward IKr (i.e., the decrease in p(o) of IKr in Fig. 2.6b). As rc of IKr decreases, it is substituted by those of the inward currents, Ist and ICaL, via depolarization-dependent activation. rc of Ist reached a peak of ~0.63 and then decreased after 220 ms, which is simply biased by the much larger increase in rc of ICaL. Although the increase of p(o) in ICaL is tiny (<0.002) during the late diastolic period, it is the main current in the upstroke of the action potential and also affects
dVL/dt. Inward Ih also plays a positive role at the early stage with an rc of ~0.1. This is relatively small because the increase of p(o) saturates around 220 ms and the
amplitude of Ih is small. Similarly, relatively small contribution of IKs is explained by a little change in p(o) (~0.002), which is attributable to a limited activation
during the preceding action potential. The lead potential analysis clearly separates
the role of the nonselective cation current (IbNSC) from that of Vm-gated channel currents. It has been reported that IbNSC, the largest inward current of ~À25 pA, plays a role in diastolic depolarization by driving Vm toward its reversal potential of ~0 mV [18]. However, rc of IbNSC is zero because IbNSC has neither gating nor rectiﬁcation in its channel kinetics.
The amplitude of inward going INaCa gradually decreases during the diastolic depolarization period due to a decrease of [Ca2+]i in the ﬁrst two-thirds of the depolarization phase and a continuous increase in Vm. Thereby, rc of INaCa is negative for the slow diastolic depolarization. INaK also has a negative rc because the outward INaK increases with depolarizing Vm. Because of these negative contributions of INaCa and INaK, the sum of positive contributions in the proﬁle is larger than 1.0 in this model. As far as we are aware, the concept of this negative contribution is introduced
for the ﬁrst time in this VL analysis and is clearly deﬁned by (2.20).

2.4 Variations in the Ionic Mechanisms Hypothesized by Different Mathematical Pacemaker Cell Models
It has long been suggested that the conﬁguration of the spontaneous action potentials shows variations according to the recording location within the SA node regions. This issue has been thoroughly investigated by Prof. Boyett’s group by examining the ion channel expression in different cells isolated from different locations within the SA node [19]. This kind of variation may partly correspond to variable weight of individual channel current contribution among different mathematical models as demonstrated in Fig. 2.2.

46

Y. Himeno et al.

Variations in the ionic mechanisms have also been explained by modifying the model structure. Especially the intracellular Ca2+ distribution within the cell has recently been examined in the pacemaker mechanism by assuming a subsarcolemmal space. It might be noted that SA node cells have no transverse tubules within the cell, and therefore the EC coupling may occur at the junction of subsarcolemmal cisterna of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with the surface membrane [20]. For the sake of simplicity, a uniform subsarcolemmal space was ﬁrst assumed in the SA node cell model [4]. Later, this model was further modiﬁed and used by Maltsev and Lakatta [7], focusing on the contribution of intracellular Ca2+ concentration to the pacemaker mechanisms. In the following section, we will apply the VL method to the Kurata et al. model and the Maltsev and Lakatta model to compare with the Himeno et al. model.

2.4.1 Contribution of INaCa Intensiﬁed by the Localized Ca2+ in Kurata Model
In the Kurata model, a subsarcolemmal space of 20 nm in depth is introduced underneath the surface membrane, and occupies only 1% of the cytosolic space. Since it is assumed that the Ca2+ ﬂux through both the ICaL channel as well as the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel on the SR are directed into this limited subsarcolemmal space, the transient increase in subsarcolemmal Ca2+ ([Ca2+]sub) is much larger than that in intracellular bulk Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in other SA node cell models, where [Ca2+]i is assumed to be homogeneous throughout the cell. Figure 2.7a shows the results of VL analysis as well as Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]sub and [Ca2+]i) in the Kurata et al. model. Except for the Ca2+-related events, the general view of the mechanism is in good agreement with Himeno et al. model. Namely, the successive shift of the major role from IKr to Ist and the following signiﬁcant increase in the contribution of ICaL are essentially the same in the other pacemaker cell models described previously. A gradual decrease in the negative contribution of INaCa caused by dissipation of the Ca2+ transient is also a common mechanism observed in other models. The prominent difference is the timing of conversion of the sign of INaCa contribution from negative to positive in the last one-third of the diastolic period in this model. This conversion is caused by voltage-dependent activation of ICaT as well as ICaL over the corresponding time period in Kurata et al.’s model. [Ca2+]sub increased twice as much as that in myoplasm at 125 ms and yielded a peak of ~1.8 mM at its maximum as reported by Glukhovsky et al. [21] and Snyder et al. [22] in their simulation studies. The activation of ICaT starts soon after the maximum diastolic potential, and thereby favors the early contribution of INaCa through the Ca2+ accumulation in the subsarcolemmal space. The rc of INaCa, which is accelerated by the Ca2+ released from the SR is still minor (27%) in this model at the end of the VL proﬁle. The rc of ICaT is enlarged in this model (22%) compared to that in Himeno et al.’s model (12%). The maximum amplitude of ICaT reached to ~À7 pA in the late diastolic depolarization in the Kurata et al. model (Fig. 2.7), whereas it is

only À0.2 pA in Himeno et al.’s model (Fig. 2.6). The difference is attributable to the different experimental data referred to in each model as explained in Sect. 2.3 above and Fig. 2.3. Kurata et al. assumed a larger contribution of ICaT to the pacemaker depolarization based on an experimental observation by Doerr et al. [23] and adopted equations from model by Demir et al.

2.4.2 Intracellular Ca2+ Clock in Maltsev and Lakatta Model
A new pacemaker mechanism was recently proposed by Prof. Lakatta’s group (the intracellular Ca2+ clock [24–26]). This mechanism is quite comparable to the
“triggered activity,” which is well established in the ventricular myocytes. If
ventricular myocytes are superfused with solution containing moderate concentrations of cardiotonic steroids and a high concentration of extracellular Ca2+ (75–200 ng mlÀ1 acetylstrophantidin and 2.5 mM Ca2+ in Ferrier and 2–10 mM ouabain and 5.4 mM Ca2+ in Matsuda et al., respectively) [27, 28], the Ca2+ content in the SR is increased and the spontaneous Ca2+ release is accelerated. By applying
conditional depolarizing pulses under the voltage clamp condition, this spontaneous Ca2+ release can be detected by the oscillatory transient inward current, INaCa. Without the voltage clamp, repetitive Ca2+ transients or inward INaCa are evoked after conditional repetitive electrical stimulation. When the increase in the ampli-
tude of transient depolarization was sufﬁcient to bring the membrane potential to
the threshold, a spontaneous full-amplitude action potential was elicited, especially with b-adrenergic stimulation. This triggered activity disappears if the ventricular myocytes are relieved from the Ca2+-overload. Healthy myocytes do not show the
transient depolarization or inward current. In SA node pacemaker cells, repetitive Ca2+ transients were recorded by Prof.
Lakatta’s group when the spontaneous action potential was stopped by the voltage
clamp even under normal physiological conditions. Vinogradova et al. observed
repetitive spontaneous inward currents, which were largely dependent on the spontaneous Ca2+ release from SR [24]. Despite only a limited number of studies
have described this repetitive spontaneous inward current under normal physiolog-
ical conditions, this hypothesis has provoked a lot of discussion and was recently
explained with a concrete SA node pacemaker cell model [7]. The signiﬁcant
modiﬁcations from the Kurata et al. model [4] were reductions of conductances in major inward currents, gCaL, gCaT, gh and gst, by 20, 60, 60 and 80% respectively, which interfered spontaneous generation of the action potential by plasma membrane currents. In addition, the Ca2+-dependent mechanisms were enhanced by increasing the maximum amplitude of INaCa by 50% and adding the background Ca2+ inﬂux (Ibca). Parameters for the SR Ca2+ dynamics, such as the time constant of Ca2+ transfer from the network SR (uptake site) to junctional SR (release site) and rate constant for Ca2+ uptake by Ca2+ pump and Ca2+ release ﬂux via RyR, are also
modiﬁed to strengthen the effect of the SR based on their experimental results [25]. Consequently, it is noted that [Ca2+]sub starts increasing almost from the beginning

of the slow diastolic depolarization and activates INaCa signiﬁcantly to contribute to Vm change throughout the slow diastolic depolarization, as revealed by the VL analysis (Fig. 2.8).

2.5 Ionic Mechanisms Underlying the Positive Chronotropy Induced by Catecholamine Stimulation

In the working heart, pacemaker cells are always under the inﬂuence of humoral and neural regulation and their activity is modiﬁed every moment. In this chapter, we focus speciﬁcally on regulation by catecholamines, simulating the effect of sympathetic nerve input. Although sympathetic regulation is crucial in understanding positive chronotropy, the complex signal transduction process that occurs within a cell hinders us from intuitive comprehension of the acceleration mechanism. Therefore, we will introduce a mathematical SA node cell model with an adrenergic signaling cascade to clarify the contribution of each ionic component to the pacemaker activity during catecholamine stimulation.

2.5.1 Revision of the Kyoto Model: From Sarai et al. Model to Himeno et al. Model
The Kyoto model was ﬁrst published in 2003 [5, 29] and reproduced action potential generation, intracellular ion homeostasis, and Ca2+ dynamics in ventricular myocyte and SA node pacemaker cells. Since then, the model has been improved continuously by reﬁning the mitochondria portion of the model [29], updating ion channel representations [30], modeling volume regulation [17], and adding a b1-adrenergic signaling module [31]. In 2008, we revised our Sarai et al. SA node model [5] to include the above components developed mainly for the ventricular myocyte model to analyze the role of each ion current in the positive chronotropy during b1-adrenergic stimulation (Himeno et al. model) [6]. Our new model is based on experimental ﬁndings in guinea pig SA node cells, which show relatively large IKs as a target of the b1-adrenergic stimulation. We also included an alteration of Ca2+ dynamics caused by a modiﬁcation of the Ca2+ pump (SERCA) on the sarcoplasmic membrane to gain new insights into possible effect of b1adrenergic stimulation on Ca2+ handling in pacemaker cells.

2.5.2 Modeling the Catecholamine Effects on Individual Current Systems
The b1-adrenergic cascade model shown in Fig. 2.9 is basically taken from the Kuzumoto et al. model [31], which is mostly a derivation of the Saucerman et al. model [30]. Brieﬂy, the decoupling of the a-subunit of the Gs protein (Gsa) from Gsbg occurs after the activation of the b1-adrenergic receptor (b1AR), which is stimulated by giving a concentration of b1-speciﬁc agonist isoprenaline (ISO) and partly inactivated by phosphorylation at S301 by protein kinase A (PKA) and at S464 by b-adrenergic receptor kinase (b-ARK). Then, the activated Gsa enhances cAMP

Fig. 2.9 A schematic diagram of pacemaker cell model. The model includes the 15 kinds of ion channels, the sarcolemmal Na+/K+ pump, Ca pump, Na+/K+/2ClÀ cotransporter, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The model is also consist of sarcoplasmic reticulum including the Ca2+-release channels (RyR and leak channels) and the Ca2+ pump, the contraction model and the oxidative phosphorylation model, as well as the b1-adrenergic signaling cascade (ﬁgure taken from Himeno et al. 2008 [6])
synthesis by activating adenylate cyclase (AC). The amount of free cAMP is determined by the balance between the synthesis and degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE). The unleashing of catalytic subunits of PKA is partially calculated as a function of the concentration of cAMP. The catalytic subunit of PKA is inactivated by protein kinase inhibitor (PKI). Applying 0.01 mM ISO to the model cell increases the activated catalytic subunit of PKA by about 2.3-fold. The concentrations of cAMP and PKA reach a peak about 20 s after the application and then slowly decrease. The equations for describing these reactions may be referred to in the original papers.
The targets of PKA in our SA node model are ion channels on the plasma membrane that conduct ICaL, Ist, Ih and IKs, and ion transporters such as the Na+/K+ pump, sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and sarcoplasmic reticulum SERCA. For convenience, the ion ﬂuxes of these ion transporters are all expressed as currents such as INaK, IPMCA, and ISRU, respectively. ICaL, Ist, Ih, IKs, INaK, IPMCA, and ISRU are modulated as a function of the concentration of PKA catalytic subunits ([PKA]) or cAMP ([cAMP]). Mathematical descriptions of PKA- or cAMP-dependent activations of these proteins, which are newly introduced in our model, are provided as follows.
2.5.2.1 IKs; ISRU and IPMCA
Essentially the same equations as those in the ventricular cell model by Kuzumoto et al. [31] are used in the b1-adrenergic stimulation of IKs, ISRU, and IPMCA. For IKs, phosphorylation of the main subunit KCNQ1 by catalytic PKA is

52

Y. Himeno et al.

modeled based on Saucerman et al. [32] to reproduce the increase of the current. As to ISRU, the dissociation constant of SERCA for intracellular Ca2+ is assumed to be regulated by catalytic PKA via phosphorylation of phospholamban [30]. The maximum pumping rate of PMCA is augmented by an increase in the concentration of catalytic PKA, whose activity is augmented by cAMP by 2.4 times as observed experimentally. The model equations for these reactions may be referred to the original papers.

2.5.2.2 ICaL

To reproduce ampliﬁcation of pmax and negative shift in the voltage-dependent activation of ICaL induced by the b1-adrenergic stimulation [33, 34], a mathematical representation is determined according to (2.11) as follows:

ICaL ¼ pmax Á fPKA Á pðoÞ Á f ðVm þ VshiftÞ:

(2.22)

Namely, the permeability of ICaL (pmax ¼ 31.5 pA mMÀ1) is multiplied by a factor.

(2.23)

where the value for the maximum amplitude (max_f), Hill coefﬁcient (nH), and the equilibrium constant for PKA (KmPKA) are 17.5, 1, and 6.5 mM, respectively.
The rate constants of all voltage-dependent gates for ICaL are biased with Vshift, which is determined by the difference between concentrations of catalytic PKA before and after the b-adrenergic stimulation:

(2.24)

where max_v is 62.5 mV. As a result, the current amplitude was nearly doubled and the voltage dependency of the peak current–voltage relationship was shifted negatively by ~7 mV in response to 0.1 mM ISO as observed in experiments.

2.5.2.3 Ist

The increase of Ist induced by the b-adrenergic stimulation is reconstructed by ﬁtting the following equation to experimental data obtained by Toyoda et al. [16].

Ist ¼ pmax Á fPKA Á pðoÞ Á f ðVmÞ:

(2.25)

The same (2.23) is applied to fPKA, where values of pmax, max_f, nH, and KmPKA are 62.5 mM mMÀ1, 1, 1, and 0.065 mM, respectively. Vshift is not included in this Ist model for simplicity.

2.5.2.4 Ih; Iha or If

The b-agonists shift the activation curve of Ih, Iha or If positively on the voltage axis [35]. Representation of Iha in our model is:

Iha ¼ pmax Á pðoÞ Á f ðVm þ VshiftÞ:

(2.26)

2.5.2.5 INaK

Na+/K+ pump is regulated by phospholemman, one of the members of FXYD proteins. We assumed that Na+ afﬁnity (KmNai) is increased by catalytic PKA (35% decrease in the half maximum concentration for Na+) to ﬁt to the experimen-

The effects of b1-adrenergic stimulation are shown in Fig. 2.10. In each panel, two traces obtained before and during the stimulation (20 s from the onset) are superimposed by referring to the maximum rate of rise of the action potential. The slope

The black traces are control and red traces ISO traces superimposed at the time point of the maximum rate of rise of the action potential. The peak of ICaL is out of the scale. (b) Modulation of INaCa, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and INaCa by b1-adrenergic stimulation
of slow diastolic depolarization was signiﬁcantly increased by 0.01 mM ISO from 0.087 to 0.126 mV msÀ1, when measured over the linear portion of the diastolic depolarization. This increase in the depolarizing rate decreases the duration taken for ~25 mV depolarization from the maximum diastolic potential (À65 mV) to the take-off potential of the action potential (~40 mV) by approximately 88 ms. Although the peak amplitude of ICaL increased signiﬁcantly from 158 to 184 pA, the increase of ICaL during the slow diastolic depolarization is small if compared with that of Ist. To estimate the relative importance of Ist and Ih during the diastolic depolarization, the time-integral of Ist and Ih was measured over the initial period of 280 ms from the maximum diastolic potential. The increases in electrical charge carried by Ist and Ih induced by the b1-adrenergic stimulation were nearly equal

2 Ionic Basis of the Pacemaker Activity of SA Node

55

(the ratio DIst/DIh ¼ 1.19), indicating that Ist and Ih almost equally contribute to the positive chronotropy.
Since outward IKr is not a target of PKA, its increase during diastole is secondary to the modiﬁcation of the membrane potential. The amplitude of IKs is increased by up to 150% at the peak. Although IKs is enhanced by both PKA and increased Ca2+ transients, the amplitude of IKs during diastolic depolarization remained negligibly small. The increase in IKs, however, is useful in compromising the effect of ICaL to elongate the action potential under the b1-adrenergic stimulation.
The PKA-dependent activation of Ca2+ uptake by SERCA accelerated the decay of the Ca2+ transient, and increased the Ca2+ content within the SR, supplemented by the increased Ca2+ inﬂux through ICaL. Thus, the peak amplitude of the Ca2+ transient was increased by 56% (Fig. 2.10b). The magnitude of inward INaCa was almost equal to that observed in control during diastolic depolarization (Fig. 2.10b,
bottom panel). Thus, modulation of INaCa does not seem to contribute to the slow diastolic depolarization. On the contrary, the increase in INaCa during the action potential hampered the positive chronotropic effect of b1-adrenergic stimulation by
prolonging the action potential duration.

2.5.4 Contribution of Each Ionic Component to the Pacemaker Depolarization During Catecholamine Stimulation
Figure 2.11 compares results of the VL analysis obtained before (bottom panel) and 20 s after the onset of ISO application (top panel). The time axis of the control proﬁle at the bottom is reduced to ~2/3 and the membrane potentials obtained before (black) and after ISO application (red) are superimposed in the middle panel. In general, the contribution proﬁle remained very similar after the b-adrenergic stimulation when the time axis is normalized with the time course of the proﬁle obtained in the presence of ISO. Namely, the early contribution of IKr deactivation is ﬁnally connected to the ICaL activation near the foot of the action potential via the contribution by both Ist and Ih activation in the intermediate phase. The contribution of Ih is enlarged from ~0.1 in the control to 0.33 after the ISO application, because of the positive voltage shift of Ih activation. These common proﬁles are well explained by the overlapping time course of membrane depolarization. The negative contribution of INaCa is also common for both the control and the b-adrenergic stimulation. Although the positive contribution of INaCa at the end of the slow diastdic depolarization, corresponding to the Ca2+ transient increased from 0.26 in control to 0.35 with 0.01 mM ISO application, the contribution was only transient. Therefore, it may be concluded that INaCa is scarcely involved in the positive chronotropy in our model.
As to the role of IKs in the pacemaker depolarization, there might be species difference. In the present VL analysis, only a little contribution is disclosed in IKs as shown in Fig. 2.11 in the guinea pig model. However, a larger contribution of IKs has been supposed in the porcine and human SA node cell, which has dominant

2.6 Conclusions
The lead potential analysis revealed a common proﬁle of contributions of ionic channels and transporters among variety of pacemaker cell models of small mammals. That is, the transition of the main contributor current from IKr to ICaL transmitted by a set of inward currents, such as Ist, Ih, and ICaT. As to the role of INaCa, although the extent of the contribution may differ, the contribution of INaCa is no more than substitution of some contribution of the set of inward currents. It should be noted that the variations among models arise from the different weights of each ionic current in the set of inward currents, leaving the common feature intact. To our surprise, the common feature was maintained even when the

3.1 Introduction: The Mechanism of Cardiac Pacemaking
The spontaneous activity of the heart has been known for a long time. In the second century AD, the physician Claudius Galenus (Galen of Pergamum AD ca 130–ca 200) realized that when extracted from the chest the heart keeps beating for a long period. Several more centuries were necessary, however, for Keith and Flack to discover, in 1907, a structure responsible for the initiation of the heartbeat, the sinoatrial node (SAN) [1, 2]. More than 100 years later, the electrical and molecular mechanisms responsible for the intrinsic automaticity of the SAN are still debated [3].
The shape and duration of action potentials (APs) of SAN cells are different from those of atrial and ventricular myocytes, most notably for the presence of the diastolic phase (pacemaker or diastolic depolarization, DD) which drives the membrane potential from the maximum diastolic potential (MDP, around À60 mV) up to threshold (around À40 mV) for another AP, thus generating autorhythmicity.
The pacemaker phase is the result of a concerted interplay of several mechanisms comprising ionic currents, pumps and exchangers. Activation of the “funny” current (If or “pacemaker” current) drives early DD up to a point where Ca2+dependent mechanisms, involving ﬁrst the T-type calcium current and the Na–Ca exchanger, and then the L-type Ca2+ current, kick in to determine the late fraction of DD and help reaching the threshold of a new AP. The events leading to the discovery of the funny current and its main properties in SAN tissue/cells are described below.

3.1.1 Historical Background and Basic Biophysical Properties of If

In 1979 a new pacemaking mechanism was proposed to explain the spontaneous
activity of SAN myocytes. This mechanism was based on the activation, upon
hyperpolarization to the diastolic (pacemaker) voltage range, of an inward current,
responsive to stimulation by noradrenaline. The current was dubbed “funny” (If) because of its unusual properties [4]. Prior to the discovery of If, pacemaking had been largely investigated in Purkinje ﬁbers and attributed to a completely different mechanism, the decay of a K+ current (IK2). However, some IK2 properties, such as a strong dependence on external Na+ and a very negative reversal potential, did not reconcile with those of a pure K+ current. The pacemaking mechanism proposed for
SAN myocytes based on If was actually opposite to that involving IK2 deactivation suggested for Purkinje ﬁbers. This puzzle was solved in 1981, with the demonstra-
tion that IK2 was the same If current just discovered in the SAN [5, 6]. The If current had several unusual features. It was the ﬁrst voltage-and time-
dependent current found to be activated on membrane hyperpolarization rather than on depolarization and had a reversal potential around À10/À20 mV, due to a mixed Na+ and K+ permeability [5–8]. Although the Na+/K+ permeability ratio is about 0.27–0.33, implying a preferential permeability of K+ over Na+, Na+ permeation is
functionally important because it renders the current inward and depolarizing at diastolic voltages (about À40 to À60 mV in the SAN). Finally, If had a dual modulation by voltage and cyclic nucleotides [9].

3.1.2 Voltage Dependence of f-Channel Activation
According to data from the literature, the voltage range of activation of If in the SAN has a large variability with threshold values ranging between À32 and À70 mV, and half-activation voltages (V1/2) in the range À50/À120 mV [10]. These differences can be explained partly by the different experimental conditions and partly by the high sensitivity of this channel to the cellular “environment.” For example, cAMP concentration and “run-down” can inﬂuence the open probability of f-channels [11]. Run-down causes a rapid negative shift of the f-channels activation curve during whole-cell patch clamp recordings and can induce a substantial underestimation of the If contribution [12], which might explain the highly negative threshold or V1/2 values reported in some studies. Other mechanisms modulating f-channel function include phosphorylation [13, 14], interaction with auxiliary subunits [15–19], and interaction with lipids and/or structural proteins [20, 21].
The variability in the activation range of If becomes even greater when considering that f-channels are also expressed in other autorhythmic cardiac regions such as the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the His-Purkinje system [22], where If activates at more negative voltages compared to SAN myocytes [23, 24].

Expression of f-channels has also been reported in working myocardium (atrial and ventricular muscle), although their physiological relevance is negligible due to the low expression and to the too negative range of activation [25, 26]. Interestingly, pathological conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy may lead to an increased f-channel expression in the working myocardium, with associated increased propensity to ventricular arrhythmias [27].

3.1.3 If -Mediated Autonomic Modulation of Cardiac Rate
The heart rate needs to be promptly adjusted to the physical and emotional state of the organism. Since the duration of DD is a main determinant of heart rate, its ﬁne modulation is achieved by precise control of the steepness of DD by autonomic neurotransmitters (Fig. 3.1c). Sympathetic stimulation accelerates, and parasympathetic stimulation slows heart rate, through activation of b-adrenergic (b-ARs) and muscarinic M2 receptors, respectively. b-ARs (coupled to stimulatory G-protein, Gas) and M2 receptors (coupled to inhibitory G-proteins, Gai) exert opposite effects on adenylate cyclase thus controlling, together with cAMP-phosphodiesterase, the cytosolic concentration of cAMP.
cAMP directly binds to f-channels and shifts their activation curve towards more positive potentials [28]. This mechanism increases the net inward current ﬂowing

during the DD, and results in the steepening of DD slope and consequent cardiac acceleration [29]; slowing of heart rate is obtained by an opposite set of events initiated by M2-receptor-mediated decrease in cAMP.
Both b1 and b2 subtypes of b-ARs are expressed in the heart and although b1ARs are predominant, the SAN has the highest expression of b2-ARs among cardiac tissues [30]. Interestingly, in rabbit SAN myocytes stimulation of b2-ARs causes a larger shift of If activation curve and a more pronounced positive chronotropy than b1-AR stimulation. This is due to co-localization of b2-ARs and f-channels in speciﬁc membrane microdomains (caveolae, see also Sect. 3.2.2.3.1) [21].

3.2 Molecular Structure of Pacemaker Channels
The genes encoding the molecular correlates of f-channels were cloned in the late 1990s [31]. Based on structure homology, the f-channel a-subunits, termed Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, were included in the superfamily of voltage-dependent K+ and CNG channels. HCN channels have been cloned from vertebrates, invertebrates and urochordates; in mammals four different isoforms were found (HCN1–4) [32, 33]
HCN isoforms are widely expressed both in excitable (heart and nervous system, and also smooth muscle) and non-excitable tissues (testes, pancreatic b-cells) [33]. The various subunits can assemble to form functional homomeric and/or heteromeric channels (with the exception of HCN2–HCN3 heteromers) which are tetramers [33, 34].
The overall structure of HCN channels includes: a conserved core region formed by six transmembrane (S1–S6) domains, with a positively charged S4 segment; a pore (P) region involving S5, S6 and their connecting loop; a relatively short intracellular N-terminus and a relatively long intracellular C-terminus which are less conserved among isoforms. All HCN isoforms exhibit, within the permeation pathway, a selectivity ﬁlter including the GYG triplet typical of K+ channels, although partially hydrated Na+ ions can also accommodate in the not-too-rigid structure of the inner pore of HCN channels [35].
The N-terminus contains a sequence which appears to be important in mediating channel trafﬁcking to the plasma membrane [36, 37]. In the C-terminus, three separate structural elements can be recognized: the C-linker, organized in six a-helices, the Cyclic Nucleotide Binding Domain (CNBD), and the actual C-terminus. The CNBD and the C-linker act as a functional unit that modulates the open probability of a pacemaker channel. When cAMP is bound the a-helices of the C-linker of one subunit interact with the a-helices of the adjacent subunit, a conformation favoring the open state of the channel. The removal of cAMP favors a rearrangement of the structure leading to channel closing [38–40].
The overall molecular structure confers to all HCN isoforms the speciﬁc functional properties typical of f-channels described above; there are nonetheless important differences in the rates of channel opening/closing and cAMP sensitivities.

HCN1 is by far the fastest activating/deactivating isoform, followed by HCN2 and HCN3, while HCN4 has the slowest kinetics [41, 42]. HCN1 is weakly affected by cAMP (4.3–5.8 mV maximal shift), HCN2 and HCN4 display a larger response (shifts of 16.9–19.2 and 11–23 mV respectively), and the activation curve of HCN3 is shifted to the negative direction (from À2.9 to À5 mV) [38, 43]. The voltage dependence of activation also varies: HCN1 has the most positive V1/2 followed by HCN4, HCN3 and HCN2 [42]. Finally, the functional properties of these channels depend on several factors, referred to as “context dependence”, which can signiﬁcantly offset the position of the activation curve [44].

3.2.1 HCN Composition of Native Pacemaker Channels
The existence of four different HCN isoforms was initially seen as a possible basis for tissue-speciﬁc differences in If properties. However, none of the four isoforms, when heterologously expressed as homomeric channels, could generate currents with properties identical to those of native If current in speciﬁc cardiac tissues. This ﬁnding raised the question whether native pacemaker channels could be heteromers of different subunits, and prompted the study of the distribution of HCN channels in different cardiac regions. Analysis of HCN distribution indicated that the HCN4 isoform represents the major component of pacemaker channels in the SAN (Table 3.1). In fact, from early cardiac development up to adulthood, HCN4 expression delineates the pacemaker region/conduction system of the heart [54, 55, 61, 62]. Species-dependent expression of HCN1 and HCN2 has also been reported in the SAN, but always at a much lower level than HCN4 expression [34]. In the working myocardium, HCN2 is the predominant isoform even though at a low level of expression compared to SAN and conduction system. The HCN3 isoform has been found both in mouse SAN and ventricle at the mRNA level, with higher expression during embryogenesis, but protein expression has never been shown [34].
As a consequence of the ﬁnding that more than one HCN subunit is coexpressed in a speciﬁc cardiac region, the ability of the various subunits to co-assemble in heterotetramers was evaluated. Co-expression of various subunits often results in functional channels displaying kinetic and modulatory characteristics intermediate between those of the individual components; nevertheless, heterotetramers often failed to fully recapitulate native If [33, 63, 64].

3.2.2 Regulation of HCN Channels
When HCN2 channels are heterologously expressed in neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes, they generate similar currents, but the voltage range of activation in neonatal cells is some 18 mV more positive than in the adult [65]. A 22 mV difference is also found when comparing native If activation curves in newborn

and adult ventricular myocytes [66]. These differences cannot be readily explained in terms of different channel-bound cAMP concentrations. Indeed HCN channels are also regulated by several other factors such as Src-kinases [13, 67], membrane phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI(4,5)P2) [68, 69], cholesterol [20] and by interaction with transmembrane/intracellular proteins (KCNE2, caveolin 3, KCR1, SAP97) [15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 70, 71]. As mentioned above, these and perhaps other modulatory factors generate a “context dependence” of funny channels.

3.2.2.1 Src-Kinases
Src forms complexes with HCN2 and HCN4 channels and phosphorylates HCN4 in at least two different highly conserved tyrosine residues in the C-linker (Tyr 531 and Tyr 554) [13, 14]; this increases channel open probability and speeds activation kinetics [13].

3.2.2.2 Cholesterol and Membrane Phospholipids
Phospholipids are not uniformly distributed in the membrane but form distinct microdomains, called lipid rafts, enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids [72]. In rabbit SAN myocytes, HCN4 localizes in caveolar lipid rafts and their disruption strongly affects f-channel kinetics, shifting the activation curve toward more positive potentials and slowing deactivation kinetics, which leads to acceleration of spontaneous activity [20].
Funny channels are also modulated by PI(4,5)P2 whose depletion can partially explain the If run-down phenomenon [69]. Furthermore, the increase of PI(4,5) P2 mediated by activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (bradykinin BK2 receptor and muscarinic M1 receptor) can modulate channel gating; speciﬁcally, stimulation of BK2 receptors induces a large positive shift of the activation curve of HCN2, HCN1 and SAN f-channels [68].

3.2.2.3 Protein–Protein Interactions
A well established function of lipid rafts is to conﬁne in a discrete membrane domain proteins involved in the same signal transduction pathway, so as to favor their functional interaction [72]. Functional interactions able to alter channel properties have been demonstrated between cardiac HCN channels and caveolin 3, MiRP1, KCR1 and SAP97 (Fig. 3.2).

Caveolin 3
Caveolae are a type of lipid raft characterized by the presence of the scaffold protein caveolin. In rabbit SAN cells, particularly rich in caveolae [73], HCN4

co-localizes and interacts with caveolin 3 [21, 71]. Disorganization of caveolae strongly affects f-channel kinetics, by shifting the activation curve toward more positive potentials, slowing deactivation kinetics and altering adrenergic modulation [20, 21].
MiRP1
Mink-related protein 1 (MiRP1 or KCNE2) is a single transmembrane domain protein that acts as b-subunit of hERG and HCN channels. It has been shown that MiRP1 interacts with HCN2 channels in SAN and ventricular myocytes. In heterologous expression systems, MiRP1 increases HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4 current densities and alters activation kinetics; this latter effect, however, depends on the speciﬁc isoform tested and on the expression system used [15–17].
KCR1

density, and a negative shift of the activation curve when both proteins are coexpressed in CHO cells. Exogenous expression of KCR1 in neonatal ventricular myocytes decreased current density, while down-regulation of KCR1 by speciﬁc siRNA (small interfering RNA) increased current density. Interestingly, in pig and rat hearts, the SAN has the lowest level of KCR1 mRNA, in agreement with the relevant role of If in this tissue [18].

SAP97
In rabbit SAN, HCN2 and HCN4 channels co-localize with the Synapse Associated Protein-97 (SAP97), a scaffold protein which clusters proteins at the cell membrane. In heterologous expression systems, SAP97 functionally interacts with HCN2 and HCN4 channels through a PDZ domain and alters the current density, though in a context-(in CHO cells but not in HEK cells) and isoform-speciﬁc manner (increases HCN2 and decreases HCN4 current) [19].
While a general picture of all the relative interactions among these proteins is still lacking, the above data, together with evidence that in heart MiRP1, SAP97 and other voltage-gated ion channels are also associated with caveolin 3-rich membrane microdomains [74, 75], suggest the formation of a macromolecular complex important for the proper activity and modulation of HCN channels and for the correct electrical function of SAN pacemaker myocytes.

3.3 Pacemaker Channels in Cardiac Development
In the chick embryonic heart, pacemaker activity initiates from the sinus venosus (the prospective SAN) before the ﬁrst contraction takes place [76–78]. In mice, the ﬁrst cardiac contraction is visible around embryonic day 8.5 (ED8.5) when the heart is a linear tube; at this stage all cardiomyocytes, when isolated, are autorhythmic and express the If current [79]. Towards the end of gestation (ED18), the number of spontaneously active myocytes decreases to 33%. Interestingly this occurs in parallel with an 82% decrease of If current density and a concomitant large down-regulation of HCN1 and HCN4 mRNAs, by far the predominant HCN isoforms at early stages of development [79].

3.3.1 f/HCN Channels During Embryonic Cardiac Development
A detailed analysis of HCN4 localization during mouse cardiac development, by in situ hybridization, indicates that HCN4 mRNA is already expressed in the cardiac mesoderm at ED7.5 (in the cardiac crescent), and its expression remains conﬁned to the sinus venosus [61]. Studies addressing the molecular development of mouse

SAN have elucidated the critical role of the transcription factors Tbx18, Shox2 and Tbx3. From ED9.5, Tbx18-expressing cells proliferate to form the future SAN, and expression of Shox2 and Tbx3 represses atrial differentiation of primary pacemaker myocardium, thus limiting down-regulation of HCN4. Co-expression of Shox2, Tbx3 and HCN4 speciﬁcally delineates the developing SAN [62, 80, 81]. Interestingly, constitutive deletion of the transcription factor Shox2, an intervention leading to embryonic death at mid-gestation (ED11.5–ED12.5), prevents the expression of both HCN4 and Tbx3 and causes formation of an underdeveloped SAN and signiﬁcant bradycardia [80]. These data show that pacemaker activity, development of the SAN and expression of HCN4 are strictly related and, together with the evidence of embryonic lethality of HCN4 knockout mice, strongly support the essential role of HCN4 in the correct development of the SAN [82].

3.3.2 f/HCN Channels in Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation
An alternative approach to study early events in cardiac development involves in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs can be differentiated into spontaneously contracting myocytes [83]. ESC-derived autorhythmic cardiomyocytes display SAN-like APs and express If [84–86]. Involvement of If in the generation and modulation of rate in this cellular system has been conﬁrmed using speciﬁc If inhibitors (see below). 3 mM ivabradine, for example, slowed beating rate by 25% and reduced If by about 50% [86]; these effects are quantitatively similar to those reported in SAN myocytes. ZD7288 (0.3 mM) also slowed the beating rate by about 50% and reduced If by 15% [85]. Furthermore, the rate of spontaneously beating human ES-derived cardiomyocytes, which express a robust If current, is slowed by zatebradine, another If blocker [87, 88].
Several reports indicate that both murine and human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes express HCN channels (Fig. 3.3) [85, 86, 88–90]. Despite some variability in the isoform composition, likely arising from different ES clones and techniques employed, these reports indicate that If and the underlying HCN channels contribute signiﬁcantly to cardiac cellular autorhythmicity.

3.4 f-Channels Blockers
Given the importance of If in generation of pacemaker activity, it is not surprising that f-channels have been considered as a main target in the search for drugs able to control heart rate speciﬁcally. The underlying reason is that a speciﬁc (and moderate) reduction of If will affect only the slope of DD and thus cardiac rate, without undesired effects on AP duration and/or inotropism associated with altered K+ and/or Ca2+ channel activities.

Drugs able to selectively reduce If have, therefore, been long regarded as important tools in the search for a novel therapeutic approach to ischemic heart disease (IHD), normally due to unbalanced myocyte oxygen demand and supply. Slowing of heart rate is beneﬁcial under these conditions because it causes both a reduction in oxygen consumption and an increase in the duration of diastole and coronary perfusion. b-blockers, Ca2+ channel inhibitors and nitrates all reduce heart rate, but also cause side-effects such as reduced cardiac inotropism and are, therefore, not entirely satisfactory in terms of efﬁcacy and tolerance.
Substances able to reduce speciﬁcally heart rate, initially termed “speciﬁc bradycardic” and later “pure heart rate reducing” agents, were developed since the late 1970s, starting with a clonidine derivative (alinidine, ST 567) [10]. This family includes falipamil (AQ-A39), zatebradine (UL-FS49), cilobradine (DKAH26), ZD-7288, and ivabradine (S16257) [10, 34]. Investigation in Purkinje ﬁbers and SAN revealed that these substances reduce the slope of DD and slow heart rate by blocking the If current [91, 92]. With the exception of ivabradine, clinical use of these drugs was hampered by the presence of side-effects at therapeutic concentrations (i.e., concentrations blocking If) caused by partial block of K+ and/or Ca2+ channels, and by block of the neuronal Ih current (equivalent to the cardiac If).

Undesired visual effects were reported in patients treated with zatebradine due to block of Ih in photoreceptors [10].
Ivabradine is the only member of this family of compounds presently available on the market and is used for treatment of chronic stable angina in patients with a normal sinus rhythm and with contraindication or intolerance to treatment with b-blockers [93].
At low/moderate doses, ivabradine is a highly speciﬁc If inhibitor (Fig. 3.4). In rabbit SAN, 3 mM ivabradine decreased spontaneous ﬁring by 24%, mainly by reducing DD slope (À67%) and with only a minor effect on AP duration (+9%) [94]. Studies in rabbit isolated SAN myocytes showed that ivabradine (3 mM) blocks If substantially (about 60%) without altering either T- and L-type Ca2+ currents, or delayed outward rectifying K+ currents [95]. Additional studies showed that ivabradine acts from the cytoplasmic side [95] and that drug binding/unbinding to f-channels were constrained to open channel states [96]; also, the block has the unique feature of being determined by the direction of current ﬂow (current dependence). According to this mechanism, drug molecules are “kicked-in” to their blocking site within the pore by the outward ion ﬂow during depolarization, and “kicked off” by the inward ion ﬂow during hyperpolarization [96]. The overall block properties determine use-dependence, implying that block is favored by frequent cycling between open and closed states [97].
The bradycardic action of ivabradine has been conﬁrmed in both pre-clinical and clinical studies [34, 98, 99]. In healthy volunteers a single oral dose of ivabradine (20 mg) induced a decrease of heart rate by 18 Æ 6% during physical exercise [100]. Trials in patient with stable angina showed that the anti-anginal effects of ivabradine are comparable to those of b-blockers but without side effects such as

sexual disturbances, respiratory problems, and rebound phenomena; the only adverse events linked to ivabradine treatment were a limited reduction of blood pressure and mild, well-tolerated visual symptoms (phosphenes). The visual disturbances are due to the action of ivabradine on HCN channels in the retina [101, 102]. Ivabradine was eventually marketed at the end of 2005. A large clinical trial (BEAUTIFUL), ended in 2008, was promoted to investigate the efﬁcacy of ivabradine in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and LV dysfunction. The trial outcome was that ivabradine improves coronary endpoints (i.e., hospitalization for myocardial infarction, revascularization) in CAD patients with heart rate ! 70 bpm [103, 104].

3.4.1 Effects of Heart Rate Reducing Agents on HCN Isoforms
Investigation of the molecular interactions between heart rate-reducing agents and HCN channels is in progress. Emerging data indicate that mislocalization and/or altered expression of HCN channels may be involved in cardiac and non-cardiac pathological conditions (arrhythmias, pain associated with nerve injury, epileptic seizure disorders and others) [105–107]. An important goal of these studies is to provide information useful to the development of HCN isoform-speciﬁc agents as innovative antiarrhythmic, analgesic and antiepileptic drugs.
Some of the knowledge gained so far in relation to different pure heart ratereducing agents can be summarized as follows: cilobradine, ivabradine and zatebradine block HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4 isoforms expressed in HEK293 cells, with a similar IC50 (close to 1 mM) and Hill slope factors close to 1; these values are similar to those reported for native f-channels in SAN [10]. Ivabradine blocks HCN4 and HCN1 differently; it is an open channel blocker of HCN4 channels, and a closed-channel blocker of HCN1 channels [97]. Residues important in ZD7288-block of two HCN isoforms have been identiﬁed. In one study, binding of ZD7288 to the mHCN1 isoform was shown to depend critically on residues Y355, M357, and V359 in the S6 domain [10]. In another study, residues A425 and I432 in the S6 domain of mHCN2 were found to be critical for ZD7288 and cilobradine binding [108].

3.5 Genetics of HCN Channels
In a large-scale screen for mutations that affect the development of heart in the embryo of zebraﬁsh Danio rerio, a mutant (slow-mo) showed a substantially reduced heart rate compared to wild type animals [109]. The bradycardic phenotype was evident also in the isolated heart and patch clamp experiments showed that the only current greatly reduced (85%) was If. The slow-mo mutant was the ﬁrst genetic model showing the importance of If for generation of cardiac pacemaker activity in vivo.

3.5.1 Transgenic Animal Models

A. Barbuti et al.

In recent years, four HCN4 knockout mouse models have been developed to evaluate in vivo the functional contribution of this isoform to pacemaking [82, 110, 111]. Both global and cardiac-speciﬁc constitutive knockouts of the HCN4 gene cause premature death of mice at mid-gestation (ED9.5–ED11.5), a developmental stage when regular contractile activity normally develops [82]. SAN myocytes isolated from knockout embryos at day ED9.5 showed reduced spontaneous rate (À36.7%) and If current (À85%) compared to controls. The knockout process also led to the complete loss of cAMP-mediated b-adrenergic modulation, suggesting that the residual If current might be carried by the HCN1 and HCN3 isoforms which are almost insensitive to cAMP stimulation [42, 43, 49]. These data show that HCN4 expression is necessary for proper embryonic heart development, although they do not provide evidence for the role of the HCN4 current in the adult animal.
To avoid the limitations due to constitutive HCN4 knockout, inducible knockout animals were generated [110, 111]. In one model, ECGs recorded from freely moving knockout animals showed sinus pauses followed by normal rhythmic activity; b-modulation of rate was not lost, and any acceleration in heart rate led to a reduction of sinus pauses [110]. In another model, the induction of the HCN4 knockout was under the control of a regulatory region of the HCN4 gene. ECG recordings from these animals also showed sinus pauses (mean frequency 16.1 per minute) [111]. Since 90% of the global knockout-derived and 50% of the HCN4-targeted knockout-derived SAN myocytes were quiescent and the If current was reduced by about 75–80% [110, 111], further investigation will be required to understand the difference between the effects of knockout process on SAN automaticity in in vivo and in vitro conditions.

3.5.2 Pathologies Associated with HCN Dysfunctions
To date, four different mutations in the coding sequence of the hHcn4 gene, associated with alterations of cardiac rhythm in humans, have been identiﬁed [112–115]. One patient with idiopathic sinus node dysfunction (SND) characterized by severe bradycardia (41 bpm), intermittent atrial ﬁbrillation and chronotropic incompetence, had a deletion of a single nucleotide in exon 5 of hHcn4. This alteration caused a sequence frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon and thus in a truncated protein (HCN4-573X) lacking the CNBD [112]. In vitro expression of the mutation led to altered channel kinetics and lack of sensitivity to cAMP [112]. In another study, a missense mutation (D553N) was identiﬁed in members of a family with a complex phenotype characterized by recurrent syncope, QT prolongation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Heterologous expression experiments indicated that this mutation causes a dominant-negative trafﬁcking defect of HCN4 channels, and concomitant reduction of If [113]. However, the complexity of the arrhythmic phenotype precluded a clear link between mutation and the phenotype.

73

A direct functional correlation between defective HCN4 and arrhythmia was reported in 2006 [114] from a study on a large Italian family spanning three generations. A point mutation (S672R) in a highly conserved residue of CNBD was found to be associated with inherited asymptomatic sinus bradycardia according to an autosomal dominant pattern. The heart rate of family members carrying the mutation was signiﬁcantly slower (52.2 Æ 1.4 bpm, n ¼ 15) than that of wildtype members (73.2 Æ 1.6 bpm, n ¼ 12). Co-segregation of bradycardia with the hHcn4 gene was strong, as shown by the high LOD score value (5.47). In vitro electrophysiological analysis of S672R channels showed a more negative activation curve (À4.9 mV shift) and faster deactivation kinetics than the wild-type. The effect of the S672R mutation, in heterozygosis, is therefore analogous to a mild vagal stimulation corresponding to a low concentration of acetylcholine (about 20 nM); this action leads to a reduced net inward current during DD and negative chronotropy [114].
Another missense mutation, leading to the substitution G480R in the pore region of HCN4, has also been identiﬁed in a family with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia [115]. In vitro experiments showed that G480R channels are activated at more negative voltages and their membrane density is reduced compared to wild-type.
These ﬁndings support the idea that mutated HCN4 channels can be responsible for rhythm disturbances of various degrees of severity.

3.6 Biological Pacemaker
Normal generation and propagation of heart rhythm can be affected by several cardiac diseases such as Sick Sinus Syndrome, AV block and severe bradycardia, requiring implantation of an electronic pacemaker. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in biological pacemakers, which consist of cellular substrates able to drive a quiescent tissue and to respond to autonomic modulation. The ﬁrst attempts to induce autorhythmic activity in a quiescent substrate used viruses to over-express b2-adrenergic receptors or to inhibit inwardly rectifying K+ currents [116]. HCN channels, however, are more suitable candidates for gene transfer technology because, (1) they are active only during, and thus contribute solely to, the diastolic phase of APs, and (2) they are responsive to autonomic regulation [11, 28].

3.6.1 HCN-Gene Strategies
“Proof of principle” evidence that HCN overexpression can induce spontaneous activity was provided by experiments showing that in vitro infection of primary cultures of neonatal rat myocytes with adenoviruses carrying the mouse HCN2

channel leads to a signiﬁcant increase of their beating rate (83%) [65]. Further, in vivo over-expression of HCN2 in left atrium or in left bundle branch of dogs increased the If current density and generated stable, spontaneous activity following sinus arrest or AV block [116]. Similar strategies using HCN1 and HCN4 isoforms also successfully induced stable ectopic rhythm in an animal model [117]. To overcome the limitation of low rate at which these biological pacemakers drove the heart, either mutated HCN2 constructs, with more depolarized activation curve and faster kinetics, or HCN1–HCN2 chimeric constructs characterized by fast activation kinetics (provided by HCN1) and cAMP modulation (provided by HCN2) were used. In vivo experiments showed that the former construct improves catecholamine sensitivity but not basal heart rate, and the latter construct causes episodes of ventricular tachycardia interrupted by pauses of variable length [116].
In an alternative approach synthetic HCN channels obtained by mutating human Kv1.4 channels in four speciﬁc residues, were used. In vivo expression of the engineered channels in guinea pig ventricle generated an HCN-like inward current and an ectopic rhythm [116].

3.6.2 Stem Cell-Based Biological Pacemakers
Because of teratogenic risk, viral vectors, even if efﬁcient, are unlikely to be the delivery system of choice for HCN channels. Cell-based biological pacemakers have therefore been considered with growing interest. Progress in this direction came from use of human adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) over-expressing mouse HCN2 gene [118]. MSCs express endogenously gap junctions and when electrically coupled to ventricular myocytes their membrane hyperpolarizes, leading to large activation of the HCN2 channels and spontaneous rhythm generation in the surrounding tissue [118]. MSCs engineered with HCN4 channels were also effective in pacing a ventricular substrate [119]. A different approach was based on HCN1-expressing ﬁbroblasts induced to fuse (by PolyEthylene Glycol) with guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The heterokaryons displayed spontaneous APs with a slow depolarization phase and expressed If-like pacemaker current sensitive to the If blocker ZD7288. Surprisingly, heterokaryons were responsive to b-adrenergic but not to cholinergic agonists [116].
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), known to differentiate into spontaneously beating SAN-like cells expressing If [84–86, 88, 90] have also been used to develop a cellbased biological pacemaker. Two separate studies have demonstrated that spontaneously beating ESC-derived myocytes can pace cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and generate an ectopic rhythm when injected in the ventricle of animal models after AV ablation [87, 120] Although the presence of f/HCN channels was not directly addressed in these studies, their involvement in the generation of the rhythmic was apparent, based on evidence for rate increase by b-adrenergic activation and rate decrease by f-channel blocker ZD7288 [87, 120].

3.7 Conclusions

Although the biophysical properties of the “funny” current ﬁt well with an important role in pacemaking, the idea of this bizarre but essentially simple mechanism having a relevant part in the governance of cardiac rhythm took time to be accepted and is still hotly debated [3, 121–123]. In the late 1990s, after the cloning of the HCN genes, strong evidence in favor of f/HCN channels as key players in the pacemaking process was gathered. Analysis of HCN isoform distribution highlighted the selective expression of HCN4 channels in SAN and the conduction system of various species including humans. Embryological studies of mice showing an early onset of HCN4 expression speciﬁcally in the prospective SAN and conduction system, together with the evidence that transgenic mice lacking HCN4 gene die early during embryogenesis strengthened the functional role of f-channels in the generation of cardiac pacemaker activity. Finally, the development of f-channel blockers for the therapeutic control of heart rate in humans, and the discovery of HCN4 mutations in patients affected by rhythm disturbances, has further established the importance of f-channels in pacemaking.
