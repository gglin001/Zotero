ABSTRACT

The electro-optic technique of measuring the cardiovascular pulse wave known as photoplethysmography (PPG) is clinically utilised for noninvasive characterisation of physiological components by dynamic monitoring of tissue optical absorption. There has been a resurgence of interest in this technique in recent years, driven by the demand for a low cost, compact, simple and portable technology for primary care and community-based clinical settings, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. PPG signal provides a means of determining cardiovascular properties during the cardiac cycle and changes with ageing and disease. This thesis focuses on the photoplethysmographic signal for cardiovascular assessment.
The contour of the PPG pulse wave is influenced by vascular ageing. Contour analysis of the PPG pulse wave provides a rapid means of assessing vascular tone and arterial stiffness. In this thesis, the parameters extracted from the PPG pulse wave are examined in young adults. The results indicate that the contour parameters of the PPG pulse wave could provide a simple and noninvasive means to study the characteristic change relating to arterial stiffness.
The pulsatile component of the PPG signal is due to the pumping action of the heart, and thus could reveal the circulation changes of a specific vascular bed. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising quantitative markers of cardiovascular control. Calculation of HRV from the peripheral pulse wave using PPG, called pulse rate variability (PRV), is investigated. The current work has confirmed that the PPG signal could provide basic information about heart rate (HR) and its variability, and highly suggests a good alternative to understanding dynamics pertaining to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) without the use of an

electrocardiogram (ECG) device. Hence, PPG measurement has the potential to be readily accepted in ambulatory cardiac monitoring due to its simplicity and comfort.

Noncontact PPG (NPPG) is introduced to overcome the current limitations of contact PPG. As a contactless device, NPPG is especially attractive for physiological monitoring in ambulatory units, NICUs, or trauma centres, where attaching electrodes is either inconvenient or unfeasible. In this research, a prototype for noncontact reflection PPG (NRPPG) with a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) as a light source and a high-speed PiN photodiode as a photodetector is developed. The results from physiological experiments suggest that NRPPG is reliable to extract clinically useful information about cardiac condition and function.

In summary, recent evidence demonstrates that PPG as a simple noninvasive measurement offers a fruitful avenue for noninvasive cardiovascular monitoring.

Key words: Photoplethysmography (PPG), Cardiovascular assessment, Pulse wave contour analysis, Arterial stiffness, Heart rate (HR), Heart rate variability (HRV), Pulse rate variability (PRV), Autonomic nervous system (ANS), Electrocardiogram (ECG).

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

Optical assessment of physiological parameters is very attractive because they often provide simple, non-invasive, continuous physiological monitoring conditions. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is such a low-cost optical technique, and can simply and continuously record the light intensity scattered from a given source by the tissue and collected by a suitable photodetector. The arterial pulse waveform carries physiological information about mechanical properties of the peripheral arteries, and thus the PPG pulse wave could be used to noninvasively assess artery stiffness. A pulsatile PPG signal reveals the heart rate (HR) and could be used to study heart rate variability (HRV). The noncontact concept provides an innovative development for PPG technique.

1.1 Background and motivation

Noninvasive biomedical monitoring (NIBM) and noninvasive medical diagnosis (NIMD) are preferred whenever possible to avoid the risks and expense attendant to surgical opening of the body surface, e.g. infection; adverse systemic reactions to anaesthesia, dye injections, antibiotics and other medications; and surgical error. Optical assessments of physiological parameters are very attractive since they often provide simple, noninvasive, continuous physiological monitoring conditions. Nowadays, physiological signals can be accurately obtained and recorded by means of optical instruments, which supply researchers and doctors with important information as a basis for diagnosis and treatment. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is such a simple and low-cost optical technique that allows noninvasively detecting blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. The most recognised waveform feature is the peripheral pulse, and it is synchronised to each heartbeat. It is generally accepted that the PPG signal can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system [1].
Arterial stiffness is recognised as a major determinant of cardiovascular risk [2]. Although pulse wave velocity (PWV) is accepted as the ‘gold standard’ measurement of arterial stiffness [3], it is solely a measure of large artery segments [4] and offers no insight into the status of smaller blood vessels. Assessment of smaller arteries may allow much earlier identification of cardiovascular events related to arterial stiffness [5], as is significant since structural changes in the aorta are probably a late manifestation of cardiovascular abnormalities. Although it is eminently feasible to study large central and peripheral arteries using catheterisation techniques or surface tonometers, it is currently impossible to use such technologies for the direct study of small vessels. The photoplethysmographic pulse wave, recorded from photoplethysmography (PPG), provides a “window” into the properties of small arteries. The appearance of the pulse was defined as two phases: the anacrotic phase concerned with systole, and the catacrotic phase concerned with diastole and wave reflections from the periphery [6]. Stiffening of the small arteries alters the magnitude and timing of reflected waves [7]. Thus, contour analysis of the PPG pulse wave is a promising method to obtain the information of artery stiffness. The second-derivative

contour analysis has been developed to study the peripheral pressure pulse, including the screening of arteriosclerotic disease and the evaluation of ageing effect in the cardiovascular system [8-11]. Artificial neural networks [12], the extraction of periodic components using frequency analysis [13] and nonlinear dynamic analysis [14] were also used to recognise features or patterns of pulse wave. Although these approaches facilitate the distinction of the PPG waves, the physiological and clinical characteristics relating to the derived parameters have not been clearly identified, and these available publications also have ignored specific characteristics existing in young adult. Actually, the process of hardening (“stiffening”) of the arteries has been shown to start from around the first or second decades of life in healthy subjects [15]. A dicrotic notch is prevalently seen in the catacrotic phase of the PPG pulse from young subjects with healthy compliant arteries [16]. Yet few, if any, studies have examined the characteristics of dicrotic notch from photoplethysmographic pulse wave to assess the arteries stiffening in young adults. Hence, it is meaningful to noninvasively investigate the arterial stiffness of young subjects through contour analysis of photoplethysmographic pulse wave.

In recent decades, statistical operations on the R-wave to R-wave intervals (RRI) (time domain analysis) or spectral analysis (frequency domain) of an array of RRI via noninvasive techniques based on the electrocardiography (ECG) have been widely employed as markers of autonomic modulation of the heart. These clinical techniques include heart rate variability (HRV) [17, 18], baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) [19], Q-T interval [20, 21], QT dispersion [22], T-wave alternans (TWA) [23] and heart rate turbulence (HRT) [24]. Among these techniques, HRV has been recognised as a simple and valuable tool to assess the regulation of heart rate (HR) behaviour. HRV reflects the homeostatic interplay between perturbations in cardiovascular functions and the dynamic responses of the cardiovascular regulatory systems [18, 25]. There is a considerable interest in HR fluctuations because their simple statistical measures, such as the standard deviation of the interbeat intervals (the RRI), have been shown to be some of the strongest independent predictors of mortality after myocardial infarction [26]. Moreover, other techniques such as spectral analysis and nonlinear analysis of the RRI have been widely applied in HRV studies. On some occasions, these techniques have been shown to discriminate between subjects with different cardiac conditions as well as to predict mortality in some groups of patients [27, 28].

Chapter 1 Introduction

22

As the rise and fall of the PPG signal reflects the fluctuations of the heartbeats, it is possible that PPG variability, so-called pulse rate variability (PRV), does reflect the dynamics of the cardiovascular system. In contrast to ECG, PPG pulse waves, the throbbing of the arteries as an effect of the heartbeat, can be traced with a single opto-electronic sensor without any electrode, and with neither the inconvenience of installation nor the need for subjects to unclothe. Some studies have directly used PRV as the alternative for HRV assessment of heart behaviour [29, 30], but none of these studies have provided a detailed and direct quantitative comparison between the PPG and ECG signals. It is intriguing to investigate whether PRV can serve as an alternative approach to obtain HRV information.

The noncontact PPG (NPPG) concept was introduced to overcome the limitations of current contact probe, such as restriction of measurement sites, contact force from probe and hygiene risk. The NPPG was initially explored by the researchers at Loughborough University [31, 32]. The feasibility of NPPG as a substitute technique for contact PPG (CPPG) has not been studied in detail, and the effectiveness of NPPG used for biomedical monitoring needs practical examination.

1.2 Aim and objectives
This thesis aims to make contributions to photoplethysmograpic cardiovascular assessment in two aspects: the arterial stiffness of young adults and possibility of PPG signal to evaluate the cardiovascular dynamics. To that end, the specific objectives are:
I. to evaluate arterial stiffness in a group of young adults using the PPG pulse wave containing stiffness information (Study I);
II. to determine whether PRV can be used in lieu of HRV to extract cardiovascular dynamics (Study II);
III. to practically study the PRV parameters for the assessment of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) function on smokers and non-smokers (Study III);

Chapter 1 Introduction

23

IV. to develop the noncontact reflection PPG (NRPPG) and study the possibility that NRPPG could be used as a physiological monitoring system instead of CPPG (Study IV);
V. to practically study the effectiveness of NRPPG for physiological monitoring (Study V).
1.3 Thesis overview
The thesis is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 begins by introducing research background, and includes research motivations, research aims and objectives.
Chapter 2 presents the basic aspects of the PPG technique. Interaction of light with tissue is provided as the basis for understanding the principle of PPG. A brief review of the early and recent history of PPG is included. Next, the PPG measurement system is described, and two modes of PPG operation, i.e. transmission mode and reflection mode, are compared with each other. The limitations of the CPPG probe are specifically addressed; then the noncontact PPG probe is introduced as an alternative use. Finally, photoplethysmographic applications in clinical physiological measurements are presented.
Chapter 3 is concerned primarily with different methods related to cardiovascular assessment based on the PPG technique. Contour analysis for the PPG pulse wave is described and presented. Time and frequency domain and a nonlinear method for analysing variability of heartbeats are discussed.
The experimental investigations into cardiovascular assessment by means of PPG are undertaken in Chapter 4. Experimental measurements were carried out at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Loughborough University. The study population and protocols are presented. The pulse rate measurements were conducted with CPPG (Studies I-V) and NPPG (Studies IV and V). ECG is recorded to detect HR as a reference (Study II). The well-defined dicrotic notch searching algorithm (WDNSA)

is described for PPG pulse contour analysis (Study I). The lagged Poincaré plot is developed here to study PRV that is used to assess the ANS response (Study III). In this chapter, an optical model is established for NRPPG (Study IV). The relationship between quality of signal and sensor placement is experimentally tested (Study IV). Also, the agreement between CPPG and NRPPG is analysed (Study IV), and a physiological measurement is performed to confirm the prospect of the NRPPG (Study V).

Chapter 5 presents significant findings related to cardiovascular assessment based on the PPG technique. First, arterial stiffness issues associated with contour characteristic of PPG pulse wave are discussed. Then the detailed and direct quantitative comparison between the PPG-derived PRV and ECG-derived HRV is described. The findings from a practical study of PRV assessment on ANS response are illustrated. Finally, the experimental results from NRPPG as a substitute technique for CPPG are presented.

Chapter 6 discusses the findings of this work, while the final chapter, Chapter 7, briefly reiterates the major achievements of the work and provides concluding remarks. Recommendations are also made for future studies in this area.
Appendices are included to give theoretical detail of autocorrelation and autocovariance and recurrence plots used in this work. The references are listed in the final part.

CHAPTER 2
PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY: PRINCIPLES
AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEM

PPG allows the recording of pulsatile changes in the dermal vasculature and is synchronised with the heartbeat. The apparatus consists of a transducer which shines red/infrared light onto the skin. The light is absorbed by haemoglobin, and the backscattered radiation is detected and recorded. The PPG technique has been found a wide range of applications although the origin of the PPG signal is not completely understood. The basic principles of the PPG technique, together with its hardware and relevant aspects for practical use, are examined in this chapter.

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

26

2.1 Introduction
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical means to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. Hertzman and Spielman were the first to use the term ‘photoplethysmography’ and suggested that the resultant ‘plethysmogram’ represented volumetric changes in the blood vessels [6]. PPG is most often employed noninvasively and operates at a red or a near infrared (NIR) wavelength. The basic form of PPG technology requires only a few opto-electronic components: a light source to illuminate the tissue, and a photodetector to measure the small variations in light intensity associated with changes in blood perfusion. PPG has widespread clinical application. This technique will be discussed in detail in this chapter.

2.2 Principles of photoplethysmography
2.2.1 The origins of the PPG waveform
PPG is based on the determination of the optical properties of a selected skin area. Although without complete knowledge of the optical structure of tissue, a general understanding of the optical behaviour of skin has been formulated through experiments on excised tissue and the theoretical models which have been proposed. The basic anatomy of the skin with the blood vessels is shown in Figure 2-1 [33]. The diagram is representative but there are considerable variations from one site on the body to another. The skin consists of three main visible layers from the surface: epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous fat. The epidermis (100 µm thick), outside, contains no blood vessels and dead cells are continually being shed from its surface. Less numerous cells called melanocytes located near the base of the epidermis produce a dark-brown pigment called melanin, which is responsible for the protection of the skin against harmful radiation by means of absorption. The dermis (1–4 mm thick), inside, contains an extensive network of arterioles, capillaries and venules. Capillaries are very thin, fragile blood vessels that receive oxygen-rich blood from arterioles, exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide and then deliver the waste-rich blood to the venules. The capillaries are usually oriented perpendicular to the surface in most skin areas, but in the skin bordering the nails, the nailfold, the capillary loops are

parallel to the surface. The subcutaneous tissue (from 1 to 6 mm thick, in dependence from the body site) is a layer of fat and connective tissue that houses larger blood vessels and nerves. This layer plays a big role in the regulation of skin and body temperature.

The interaction of light with biological tissue is complex and includes the optical processes of (multiple) scattering, absorption, reflection, transmission and fluorescence [34]. Beer-Lambert’s law helps understanding of the absorbance of light as it passes through living tissue and why and how PPG works. Beer-Lambert’s law describes the attenuation of light travelling through a uniform medium containing an absorbing substance. If monochromatic incident light of an intensity I0 enters the medium, a part of this light is transmitted through the medium while another part is absorbed. The intensity I of light travelling through the medium decreases exponentially with the distance, as can be expressed as

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

28

I = I0e−ε (λ)cd ,

(1-1)

where ε (λ) is the extinction coefficient or absorptive of the absorbing substance at a specific wavelength, c the concentration of the absorbing substance which is constant in the medium, and d the optical path length through the medium. The concentration c is measured in mmol L-1 and the extinction coefficient is expressed in L mmol-1 cm-1.

Beer-Lambert’s law is based on the property that the sum of transmitted and absorbed light equals the incident light. It does not account for physical processes which include reflection of the light at the surface of the medium or scattering of light in the medium. However, incident light passing through human tissue is not only split into absorbed light and transmitted light as proposed Beer-Lambert’s law. Some parts of the light are reflected and others are scattered. Several approaches have been made to create models which describe the real process within certain limits of accuracy [35-37] .

The amount of light transmitted from the skin and received by the photodetector can be affected by many factors, such as blood volume, blood vessel wall movement, the orientation of red blood cells (RBC) and the wavelength of optical radiation. The signal detected by PPG consists of a steady component and a pulsatile component, which are related to the relative vascularisation of the tissue and the changing blood pulse volume, respectively [38]. In a study of fundamental aspects of the optical properties of blood in motion, Roberts [39] outlined a review of mathematical analyses of light scattering and diffusion processes taking place in blood; he proposed that light diffusion through blood, from a source outside a blood vessel, can diffuse preferentially in the direction of motion of blood which is added to the static diffusion process. Studies from D'Agrosa, Hertzman and Challoner [40, 41] have suggested that the orientation effect of RBC may play a role in the origin of the PPG signal as it could contribute to arterial opacity and would hence, affect the measurement of the PPG signal.

The wavelength of optical radiation is especially important in light–tissue interactions for three main reasons: (1) optical window, (2) isobestic wavelength, and (3) tissue penetration depth.

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

29

Optical window
The optical window is defined as the part of the wavelength spectrum which provides a relatively transparent illumination of the biological tissues. Human tissue is mainly composed of water, haemoglobin and melanin. As shown in Figure 2-2, light is increasingly absorbed by melanin towards the ultra-violet band and greatly absorbed by water in the microwave band. The optical window exists over the 600 to 1300 nm region [42], owing mainly to lack of strong absorption by blood and secondarily to lower optical scattering within the dermis, as thereby facilitates the measurement of blood flow or volume. Thus, the red or NIR wavelengths are often chosen for the PPG light source [33]. Although melanin absorption coefficients are, on average, greater than those of haemoglobin, the overall influence of melanin on light propagation in thick tissues is generally less substantial. This is due to the fact that melanin is typically confined to a thin, superficial skin layer, while haemoglobin is widely distributed throughout most tissue.

Figure 2-2. A tissue optical window exists between 600 and 1300 nm, owing mainly to lack of string absorption by blood and secondarily to lower optical scattering within the dermis.

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

Isobestic wavelength
Within the optical window of transparency the most dominant absorption of red or NIR light is by haemoglobin in its various forms. Haemoglobin is carried in RBC, and constitutes approximately 40–45% of whole blood. It is responsible for delivering oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. In the oxygenated state haemoglobin is known as oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2). The de-oxygenated form, with no oxygen molecules attached, is known as deoxyhaemoglobin (Hb). The specific absorption spectra of HbO2 and Hb, shown in Figure 2-3, differ significantly, particularly in the red region of the visible and the NIR except at the isobestic wavelengths. For measurements performed at an isobestic wavelength (i.e. close to 800 nm, for NIR range) the signal should be largely unaffected by changes in blood oxygen saturation. Using two wavelengths near the cross-over point, absorption data can be used to estimate oxygenation levels.

Tissue penetration depth

The penetration of optical radiation in the tissue is wavelength-dependent. For red light the penetration into the living skin is estimated to be between about 0.5 and 1.5 mm while for blue light this figure may be reduced by as much as a factor of four due to increased scattering and absorption in the dermis [33]. Table 2-1 gives estimated depths for which radiation is attenuated to 1/e of the incident radiation density, for fair Caucasian skin in vitro.

2.2.2 PPG signal
In PPG, the emitted light is reflected, absorbed or scattered by different substances, including skin pigmentation, arterial and venous blood and bones. The resultant emerging modulated light is measured and the variations are amplified, filtered and recorded as a voltage signal—photoplethysmogram, i.e. the PPG signal. By convention, the photoplethysmogram is inverted so that it correlates positively with blood volume.
The PPG signals, as shown in Figure 2-4, are composed of two components: a DC component, which is a relatively constant voltage, but changes in magnitude depending on the nature of the tissue through which the light passes; and an AC or pulsatile component synchronous with HR and is superimposed onto a large quasi-DC

component that relates to the tissues and to the average blood volume. The AC pulse shapes are indicative of vessel compliance and cardiac performance and the amplitude is usually 1 to 2% of the DC value.

2.3 History of PPG
This section summaries the early history of PPG and is taken from the excellent article by Challoner [40]. The first report of the application of PPG appeared in the mid 1930s. Molitor and Kniazuk [43] and Hanzlik et al [44] described similar instrument used to monitor blood volume changes in the rabbit ear following venous occlusion and with administration of vasoactive drugs. Molitor and Kniazuk also described the satisfactory recordings obtained from the skin of the human fingers using a reflection mode PPG system. A great pioneer, to whom this method owes much of its success, was A. B. Hertzman, who published his first paper on describing the use of a reflection mode system to measure blood volume changes in the fingers induced by exercise, cold and the Valsalva manoeuvre. His early work [45-48]

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

33

endeavoured to establish the validity of the method for measuring blood flow and blood volume changes. Hertzman and Dillon [49] split the AC and DC components with separate electronic amplifiers and monitored vasomotor activity. In 1940, Hertzman and Dillon [50] first used PPG for assessing the completeness of sympathectomy. The early workers in this field were limited by the size, reproducibility and sensitivity of their photodetectors. In the 1960s, with the advance of semiconductor technology these detectors has become much smaller and more sensitive and later authors have been able to investigate the technique further. Senay et al [51] and Hertzman and Flath [52] have used PPG to detect the onset of cutaneous vasodilatation in both forearm and digits. Many authors have applied PPG to tubed pedicles [53-55]. More recently, advances in opto-electronics and clinical instrumentation have significantly contributed to PPG’s advancement. A major advance in the clinical use of a PPG-based technology came with the introduction of the pulse oximeter as a noninvasive method for monitoring patients’ arterial oxygen saturation [56, 57]. PPG imaging is another emerging technology [58, 59].

2.4 PPG measurement system
2.4.1 PPG Instrumentation
Most PPG instruments consist of an optoelectronic sensor that is applied to the patient and a microprocessor-based system (MBS) that processes and displays the measurement. The optoelectronic sensor usually contains the low-voltage, high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED) as light sources to shine light onto an area of tissue and one photodiode as a light receiver to convert an optical signal in to an electrical signal. The light from the LED is transmitted through the tissue at the sensor site. A portion of light is absorbed by skin, tissue, bone, and blood. The photodiode, in response to the optical signal from the LED, measures the transmitted light. The electrical signal at the photodiode is amplified and then filtered to remove electrical and ambient noise, and then digitised by an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). The digital signal is processed by the microprocessor to identify each pulse. Figure 2-5(a) shows a transimpedance amplifier design and Figure 2-5(b) shows the signal

conditioning stages surrounding this, including low pass filtering, high pass filtering and further amplification, signal inversion and signal interface.

The AC component and a measure of the DC component are available for pulse wave analysis. A constant current driver stage for the PPG LED is also shown. [60]
2.4.2 Two modes of PPG operation
Two modes of measurement are generally used, namely the "transmission" and "reflection" modes, depending on the relative positions of the emitter and detector [61] as shown in Figure 2-6.

Figure 2-6. Two modes of PPG operation. (a) reflection mode and (b) transmission mode.

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

35

2.4.2.1 Transmission mode

Principles
In a transmission mode PPG, tissue is irradiated by a light source, and light intensity is measured by a photodetector on the other side of the tissue. A pulse of blood increases both the optical density and path length through the illuminated tissue (due to intravascular increases of RBC and the light-absorbing Hb they carry), which decreases the light intensity at the photodetector. Normally, transmission probes are placed on the subject’s finger, toe, ear or nose.

Sensor placement
The sensor placement in transmission probes has been discussed in the literature [61]. The author indicated that the photodetector should be placed in line with the light source to obtain the detection of the maximum amount of the transmitted light, as the photodiode has to detect the light transmitted through the tissue. Also, the photodiode should be placed as close as possible to the skin without exerting force on the tissue. The author has asserted several factors that influence the contacting force. First, the amount of force applied by reusable probes is much larger than the amount of force applied by disposable probes. Second, the force applied also depends on the materials used to manufacture a particular probe and also on the company which produces the probes, e.g. Nellcor clip type probes exert less pressure than Ohmeda clip type probes. If the force exerted by the probe is significant, the blood under the tissue, where the probe is placed, may clot caused by external pressure applied. And if the distance between the light source and the photodiode increases, the amount of detected light will decrease as a result of the increased optical path length as seen from Beer-Lambert’s law (section 2.2.1).

2.4.2.2 Reflection mode
Principles In a reflection mode PPG, the light source and the photodetector are positioned adjacently in close proximity on the skin surface. The illumination received by the

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

36

photodetector is a result of the backscattered light that is returning from a range of depths within the highly scattering tissue. An opaque shield is usually positioned between the optoelectronics to prevent any direct illumination from the light source to the photodetector without first passing through the tissue. This configuration enables measurement from multiple locations on the body that is not accessible using transmission mode PPG. For an accurate measurement, the probe needs to be attached firmly on the skin, and thus the measurement sites need to have a flat and wide surface area, e.g. the chest, forehead and limbs.

Sensor placement
One of the requirements in designing a reflectance PPG sensor is to determine the optimum separation distance between the light source and the photodetector. Obviously, this distance should be such that plethysmograms with both maximum and minimum pulsatile components can be detected. These pulsatile components depend not only on the systolic blood pulse in the peripheral vascular bed, but also on the amount of arterial blood in the illuminated tissue.

There are two techniques that can enhance the quality of the plethysmogram [61]. One way is to use a large light source driving current, which determines the effective penetration depth of incident light and increase light intensity. For a given light source/photodetector separation, a larger pulsatile vascular bed will be illuminated by using higher levels of incident light. As a result the reflected plethysmograms will contain a larger AC component. Practical considerations, however, limit the light source driving current to the manufacturer specified maximum power dissipation. The other way is to place the photodetector close to the light source. This alternative means will cause the photodetector to become saturated, which is mainly due to the large DC component obtained by the multiple scattering of the incident photons from the blood-free stratum corneum and epidermal layers in the skin. Thus, the selection of a particular separation distance involves a trade-off. In summary, larger plethysmogram can be achieved by placing the photodiode farther apart from the light source, while a higher light source driving current is needed to overcome absorption due to increased optical path length.

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

2.5 Practical applications of PPG

2.5.1 Measurement protocols
The PPG technique can be used to give accurate comparative data, although it cannot give quantifiable measurement in absolute units. In practice, the normal healthy skin is capable of large and rapid changes in blood flow, and consequently any measurement taken in terms of ml s-1 may have no useful meaning as this same skin site may be very different a few minutes later, for no apparent external reason. Factors which are known to effect skin flow are the thermoregulatory process, emotional state, etc. All tests should be performed at a constant temperature and humidity and at such a temperature which is appropriate to the experiment, i.e. a temperature which will be suitable for those particular skin blood flow changes. It is also very useful to make sure that the subject is relaxed and accustomed to the measurement procedure so as to reduce the flow changes induced by emotional stress.

Reproducibility of PPG measurements is discussed by Allen [60], who indicated that many factors affect reproducibility, such as the method of probe attachment to tissue, probe–tissue interface pressure, pulse amplifier bandwidth, minimisation of movement artefact, subject posture and relaxation, breathing, wakefulness, room temperature and acclimatisation. As yet, however, there are no internationally recognised standards for clinical PPG measurement. Published research tends to be based on studies using quite differing measurement technology and protocols, thereby limiting the ease with which PPG physiological measurements can be replicated between research centres.

2.5.2 Limitations of current contact PPG
The limitations of current PPG include: (1) site of measurement: the use of the transmission PPG probe is limited to areas of the body such as the peripheries and earlobes in adults, and the palm and the foot in neonates. Owing to the high vascular content, the measurements are mostly performed in the fingers and the toes. In cases where a finger probe is utilised, the measurements can only be obtained on the

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

38

peripheries that have a good anatomical fit to the probe; (2) contact force of the probe: the PPG signals may be affected by the contact force between the PPG sensor and the measurement sites as the arterial geometry can be deformed by compression; and (3) wounds or damaged tissue: a contact probe cannot be employed to obtain measurements on skin with open wounds or in cases where there is external tissue damage. Moreover, the contact probe cannot be used for the measurement when there is a need for mechanical isolation. As a result, there is a need for research into an alternative method to overcome these drawbacks. A noncontact probe could introduce new applications where attaching probe or electrode is either inconvenient or unfeasible.

2.5.3 Noncontact PPG
The concept of NPPG is described as monitoring the perfusion of an area of tissue from the classical PPG practice in a contactless way. There are several issues that need to be considered with noncontact PPG monitoring [62].
The first issue concerns the dynamic range of the detected signal. The detected pulsatile (AC) signal is very small compared to the non-pulsatile (DC) signal. To achieve a greater amplification for the AC signal, a logarithmic amplifier is used. This can be implemented electronically using a nonlinear optical preamplifier which acts as an automatic gain control (AGC). Linear PPG systems with a separate AGC could also be used, but stand a risk of saturation at the detector.
The second issue is ambient light artefact. The photodetector receives increased ambient light due to the probe separation from the tissue bed. In current PPG applications, the artefacts that arise from ambient light interference can be reduced in several ways: by suitable probe attachment to the skin (e.g. using a dark Velcro wrap-around cuff), by further shading of the study site area and performing measurements in subdued lighting, and by electronic filtering (e.g. light modulation filtering) [61]. However, ambient artefact could pose a bigger problem in noncontact PPG settings because of the separation distance between the probe and the tissue.

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

39

The third issue is the effects of motion artefact, which could be induced by any voluntary and involuntary movements of the interface between the probe and tissue bed. This effect is minimised by increasing the field of view of the source and photodetector. These effects could be more significant in noncontact PPG system because the probe is more sensitive to tissue movements, especially to movements on the skin surface.

The last issue to be considered is the effect of direct coupling, which refers to direct illumination of the photodetector by the light source without any light/tissue interaction. The direct-coupled light can cause variations in the measured PPG signal.

2.6 Clinical applications of PPG
PPG has been applied in many different clinical settings, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment, and autonomic function.

2.6.1 Clinical physiological monitoring
Pulse oximetry has been one of the most significant technological advances in clinical patient monitoring over the last few decades [63-65]. It utilises PPG measurements to obtain information about the arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate [61]. Some of the main areas in which they are used include anaesthesia [66], patient transport [67], fetal monitoring [68], neonatal and paediatric care [69], dentistry and oral surgery [70], and sleep studies [71]. In the early 1990s pulse oximetry became a mandated international standard for monitoring during anaesthesia. A recent and exciting development in pulse oximetry is the noninvasive measurement of venous oxygen saturation using external artificial perturbations applied close to the PPG probe (VENOX Technology, Chan et al [72], Echiadis et al [73]).
Arterial blood pressure is a very important clinical variable to measure. The measurement of the arterial pressure waveform at the finger with FinapresTM (for FINger Arterial PRESsure) on a continuous beat-by-beat basis was introduced in the early 1980s. The method is based on the dynamic (pulsatile) vascular unloading of the

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

40

finger arterial walls using an inflatable finger cuff with built-in PPG sensor [74]. Blood pressure was also estimated using an algorithm based on the pulse arrival time and was compared with conventional arm blood pressure measurements [75-77]. Their approach showed promise as a method for home monitoring of blood pressure. Using empirically determined transfer functions, it is possible to derive the arterial blood pressure pulse from PPG measurements [78]. An example of a commercial device for automatic PPG-based limb pressure measurement is the Vascular AssistTM vascular assessment system (Huntleigh Healthcare, UK).

Respiration causes variation in the peripheral circulation, making it possible to monitor breathing using a PPG sensor attached to the skin. The low frequency respiratory induced intensity variations (RIIV) in the PPG signal are well documented [79-81]. The RIIV is not fully understood, but is believed to be caused by skin blood volume fluctuations induced by the respiratory variations in intra-thoracic pressure transmitted to the measurement site by the venous system [82, 83].

The stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out of a ventricle during one ventricular contraction) can be estimated from PPG-derived pulse contour analysis on a beat-by-beat basis. However, there is ongoing discussion in the literature regard to the accuracy of PPG-based cardiac output assessments [84] (where cardiac output 
stroke volume × heart rate).

2.6.2 Vascular assessment
PPG occupies a unique position among noninvasive techniques in assessing patients with peripheral arterial disease. Indeed, much of vascular physiology and pathophysiology has been established based on PPG studies [85]. Disease detection with PPG is possible because the peripheral pulse usually becomes damped, delayed and diminished with increasing severity of vascular disease [86-88]. Multi-body site PPG measurements have been proposed for peripheral vascular disease detection [89-92]. The photoplethysmographic method proposed by Chowienczyk et al [93] could be a suitable alternative of noninvasive assessment of endothelial function. Gopaul et al [94] also detected endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients using the

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

41

PPG-derived reflection index. Cooke et al [95] characterised the PPG pulse shape in healthy subjects and Raynaud’s patients and found that both the pulse amplitude and the slope of the rising edge were good markers for the condition. The DC component of the PPG waveform can be used for the noninvasive assessment of lower limb chronic venous insufficiency [96] .

2.6.3 Autonomic function
The PPG signal is composite in nature and has low frequency components relating to respiration, blood pressure control and thermoregulation, as well as the high frequency components relating to the heart synchronous pulse waveform [97]. Rauh et al [98] showed that PPG was useful for detecting the gasp response and that there was a significant correlation between PPG and laser Doppler flowmetry techniques. Kistler et al [99] showed that vasoconstrictor waves at the finger are more easily demonstrable when the fingertip temperature is above 320C.
Assessment of orthostasis is a growing research area in autonomic function testing. Nasimi et al [100] investigated sympathetic neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus by monitoring PPG frequency characteristics throughout a supine-to-standing posture challenge. Nasimi et al [101] also investigated periodic posture stimulation on local vasomotor reflexes. Linder et al [102] have investigated beat-to-beat changes in the ear and finger pulses on standing and have related these to heart rate dynamics.
Meanwhile, PPG shows considerable potential for neurological assessment, with the capability to give new insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of the central and peripheral nervous systems [103-105].

2.7 Summary
Chapter 2 details the fundamental aspects of PPG, including its principles, measurement system and applications. PPG can be simply defined as the continuous recording of the light intensity transmitted or scattered from a given source by the tissue and collected by a suitable photodetector. The PPG waveform comprises a

Chapter 2 Photoplethysmography: Principles and Measurement System

42

pulsatile (‘AC’) physiological waveform, and is superimposed on a slowly varying (‘DC’) baseline. There are two different modes of detection: a transmission mode and a reflection mode. Transmission mode, where the light source is on one side of the tissue and the detector on the other, is limited to areas such as the finger, toe, ear or nose. However, reflection mode, where the light source and photodetector are placed in parallel, allows measurement of backscattered light on virtually any skin area. Additionally, NPPG is introduced as an alternative to overcome the limitation of current CPPG. Researchers have become aware of various practical considerations which may lead to more meaningful data being obtained. The specific design of a system may be decided upon by individual experimenters to suit their particular requirements.

CHAPTER 3 NONINVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR
ASSESSMENT

Palpation of the pulse has been used since ancient times to assess physical health. The contour of a digital volume pulse (DVP) is determined mainly by characteristics of the systemic circulation. Thus, contour analysis of the optically derived DVP, e.g. the PPG pulse wave, provides a simple, reproducible, noninvasive approach to derive information about cardiovascular properties.
HR is one of the most important physiological variables, and HR variability (HRV) reflects the dynamic interplay between ongoing perturbations to circulatory function and the compensatory response of short-term cardiovascular control systems. A pulsatile PPG signal reveals the HR and hence could be used to monitor HRV. Linear and nonlinear methods are used for quantification of HRV.

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

44

3.1 Contour analysis of PPG pulse wave
3.1.1 Interpretation of pulse wave changes
The peripheral pulse wave is generated by blood ejected from the heart during the opening of the aortic valve. Some important characteristics of the PPG AC pulse waveform were described by Hertzman and Spealman [6]; the appearance of the pulse was defined as two phases: the anacrotic phase being the rising edge of the pulse, and the catacrotic phase being the falling edge of the pulse. The first phase is primarily concerned with systole, and the second phase with diastole and wave reflections from the periphery. A dicrotic notch is usually seen in the catacrotic phase of subjects with healthy compliant arteries. Pulse wave pattern changes during the cardiac cycle may provide valuable information about the peripheral circulation [97].

3.1.1.1 Respiratory interaction
The photoplethysmographic signal contains respiratory induced intensity variations (RIIV) that shapes the envelope of the cardiac pulsations. It is considered that RIIV includes contributions from the venous return to the heart caused by alterations in intra-thoracic pressure. A part of the respiratory-related fluctuations in perfusion also originates from the autonomous control of the peripheral vessels, synchronous with respiration [80, 106]. The physiological mechanisms relating to the RIIV are, however, not fully understood.

3.1.1.2 Amplitude
Marked beat-to-beat variations in amplitude result from changes in stroke volume. A large amplitude wave in the underlying bed indicates local vasodilation by a direct vascular action such as histamine release or decreased vasomotor tone as might result from deep anaesthesia, ganglion block, or increased body temperature. Compression of the artery supplying the sensor site could reduce pulse volume amplitude because of hypovolemia which causes blood flow to be redirected to essential organs.

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

45

3.1.1.3 Area under the curve and the dicrotic notch

In each peripheral pulse wave, the area under the curve is an indicator of the volume of blood in the tissue scanned by the transducer. The area under the curve could be influenced by the stroke volume, modified by changes in local vasomotor tone. An ideal waveform would show a broad peripheral flow wave with a large area under the curve.

The position of the dicrotic notch on the descending section of the pressure or pulse trace can be used as an indicator of vasomotor tone. With optimal systolic filling, the catacrotic phase of the waveform will be prolonged as perfusion pressure drops more slowly. The dicrotic notch normally remains midway in the catacrotic phase. The waveform is broad-based and rounded. With suboptimal systolic filling, the broad-based rounded waveform may either be preserved or become peaked, and the dicrotic notch moves towards the baseline. Addtionally, hypovolaemia and subsequent vasoconstriction could produce a narrow-based, low-amplitude, peaked waveform with a rising dicrotic notch: filling of the arterial bed is incomplete, and thus decrease is faster. The double dicrotic notch may arise from the fact that strong pressure waves are reflected back via short (brachial) and long (femoral) artery pathways to reach a finger transducer at different times.

3.1.1.4 Baseline width
Comparing the width of the baseline with the width between the two flow peaks on either side gives an indication of the filling of the vascular bed for the prevailing vasomotor status. A rapid diastolic runoff with a relatively long baseline may indicate inadequate stroke volume.

3.1.2 Measurement and contour analysis of photoplethysmographic pulse
Analysis of the contour of the peripheral pulse to assess arterial properties was first described in the nineteenth century. Contour analysis of the PPG pulse wave measured at the finger is described by Millasseau et al [107], who gave a succinct history of the topic, highlighted the resurgence of interest in PPG-based pulse wave

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

46

analysis, and described the influence of ageing on the contour. There have been many developments since the 1940s in this pulse shape analysis. It appears that contour analysis of the DVP was initiated by Dillon and Hertzman [108], who described the shape of the DVP in terms of the crest time and dicrotic notch height. They observed a tendency of the notch to rise with systemic vasoconstriction and to decrease after inhalation of the vasodilator amyl nitrite. Characteristic changes in crest time and triangulation of the DVP were noted in patients with hypertension and arterioslcerosis.

The work from Dawber et al [16], where they obtained the DVP in 1778 individuals, proposed that the DVP be classified into one of the following classes (see Figure 3-1): class 1, a distinct notch is seen on the catacrotic phase of the pulse wave; class 2, no notch develops but the line of descent becomes horizontal; class 3, no notch develops but there is a well-defined change in the angle of the descent; or class 4, no notch develops or no change in angle of descent occurs. They found class 1 to be prevalent in younger individuals and class 4 present in older participants.

A sophisticated approach to contour analysis of the DVP has been developed by Japanese investigators [8, 10]. Their approach uses the second derivative of the finger PPG waveform to stabilise the baseline and enable the individual waves to be

visualised. Features from the second derivative of the photoplethysmogram have been correlated with vascular compliance[109-111], arterial stiffness [110], age [8, 10, 11], arterial blood pressure [8, 11], and effects of vasoactive drugs [112]. Other mathematical approaches to analysis of the DVP include artificial neural networks [12, 113, 114], the extraction of periodic components using frequency analysis [13] or nonlinear dynamical analysis [14]. The physiological and clinical characteristics relating to the derived mathematical parameters, however, have not been clearly identified.

3.2 Heart rate variability and pulse rate variability
HRV, derived from an electrocardiogram (ECG), is known to be a noninvasive indicator reflecting the dynamic interplay between perturbations to cardiovascular function and the dynamic response of the cardiovascular regulatory system. The fact that HRV analysis is able to assess overall cardiac health and the state of the ANS underlies its promise as a major tool in physiological monitoring. As the rise and fall of the PPG signal reflects the fluctuations of the heartbeats, it is possible that pulse rate variability (PRV) derived from the PPG signal does reflect the heart activity and the dynamics of the ANS.

3.2.1 HRV from ECG
3.2.1.1 ECG recording
ECG is the recording from the body surface of the electrical activity generated by the heart. ECG has provided an important noninvasive means of recording and detecting each cardiac cycle. The electrical signals within the heart are of relatively small amplitude, in the range of 100 mV. Since the inside of the human body consists of electrically conductive tissues, a part of the cardiac contraction signals is carried to the skin, where it can be detected by an ECG. At the skin, the signals are much lower in amplitude than at the heart, approximately 1 mV. However, these signals at the skin surface can be amplified and filtered sufficiently to provide a clear representation of original signals from the heart.

FIigure 3-2. The 12-lead ECG is formed by the 3 bipolar surface leads: I, II, and III; the augmented Wilson terminal referenced limb leads: aVR , aVL , and aVF ; and the Wilson terminal referenced chest leads: V1 , V2 , V3 , V4, V5 , and V6.
In order to record an ECG waveform, a differential recording between two points on the body is made. Traditionally, each differential recording is referred to as a lead. The original Lead I, II and III ECG electrode placements were defined by Einthoven in 1912. The electrode placement, called Einthoven’s triangle, is still used today for routine ECG measurement. Electrodes are placed on the left leg (on the shin above the foot), on the right arm (about one quarter of the way from the wrist on the medial surface) and on the left arm in the same location. The potentials at these body locations is denoted: vLL, vRA and vLA, respectively. ECG lead I is the potential between the left arm (+) and the right arm (-), i.e. VI = vLA - vRA. Lead II is taken

49

between the left leg (+) and the right arm (-), i.e. VII = vLL - vRA, and Lead III is between the left leg (+) and the left arm (-), i.e. VIII = vLL - vLA. Because the body is assumed to be purely resistive at ECG frequencies, the four limbs can be thought of as wires attached to the torso. Hence, lead I could be recorded from the respective shoulders without a loss of cardiac information. Today, 12-lead ECG (using 10 electrodes) provides discriminatory information for diagnosing abnormalities in the pacing and conduction system of the heart. Figure 3-2 illustrates the 12-lead set. These sites are historically based, have a built-in redundancy, and are not optimal for all cardiac events. Figure 3-3 is a typical or stylised ECG recording from lead II. Einthovin chose the letters of the alphabet from P to U to label the waves and to avoid conflict with other physiologic waves being studied at the turn of the century.

FIigure 3-3. A stylised version of a normal lead II recording showing the P wave, QRS complex, and the T and U waves. The PR interval and the ST segment are significant time windows. The peak amplitude of the QRS is about 1 mV. The vertical scale is usually 1 mV/cm. The time scale is usually based on millimetres per second scales, with 25 mm/s being the standard form. The small boxes of the ECG are 1×1 mm.
The P wave is caused by atrial depolarisation. The QRS complex is a general term representing activation in the ventricles and is a result of the depolarisation of the ventricles. The T wave results from ventricular repolarisation. The U wave, which is not always recorded on the ECG, follows the T wave and usually has the same polarity as the T wave.
ECG monitoring electrodes must make very good electrical contact with the patient in order that adequate ECG waveforms can be obtained. However, this very characteristic poses potential problems in that the electrical contact could provide a

pathway for harmful external electrical currents to enter the body and then the heart, causing severe reactions or even death. These electrical currents might originate from a faulty nonmedical electrical device such as a television, a computer, or an electric shaver, or from a fault in one of the many line-powered medical devices in hospitals, or from the normal function of some medical devices such as electrosurgery machines. Although such fault currents are rare, especially with equipment of modern design that has been properly maintained, their consequences are so severe that safeguards must be taken.

3.2.1.2 Mechanisms of HRV
Healthy cardiac function is characterised by irregular time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. This variability, namely HRV, is a result of rhythmic oscillation of the regulatory components of cardiac activity that function to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis within a defined range and to orchestrate responses to challenges. It is a valuable tool to investigate the sympathetic and parasympathetic function of the ANS. Because of continuous changes in the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance, the sinus rhythm exhibits fluctuations around the mean heart rate. Frequent small adjustments in HR are made by cardiovascular control mechanisms (Figure 3-4). This results in periodic fluctuations in HR. HRV primarily emerges through the non-additive activity originating from the individual branches of the ANS [115-117], which in turn is influenced by neuronal, humoral and other physiological control and feedback mechanisms [17]. The central nervous system (CNS), in particular the formatio reticularis of the medulla oblongata (medullar circulation centre), the hypothalamus, and neocortical and paleocortical areas also participate in all levels of cardiovascular regulation.
In a normal heart with an integer ANS, there will be continuous physiological variations of the sinus cycles reflecting a balanced symptho-vagal state and normal HRV [17]. In a damaged heart which suffered from myocardial necrosis, the changes in activity in the afferent and efferent fibres of the ANS and in the local neural regulation will contribute to the resulting sympatho-vagal imbalance reflected by a diminished HRV.

3.2.2 PRV from PPG
3.2.2.1 Mechanisms of PRV
PPG provides a qualitative measure of the tissue blood volume during cardiac cycle by measuring the light transmission through the tissue as a function of time. The AC component of the PPG pulse is synchronous with the beating heart and therefore can be a source of HR information. Pulse rate can be estimated from the time between two systolic peaks of pulse wave. Pulse rate variability (PRV) is the pulse-to-pulse alteration in pulse rate.
3.2.2.2 Comparability of PRV and HRV
Statistical operations on RRI (time domain analysis) or by spectral analysis (frequency domain) of an array of RRI via noninvasive techniques based on the ECG are being widely employed as markers of autonomic modulation of the heart. HRV

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

52

has been recognised as a simple and useful method to assess the regulation of heart behaviour. The measurement of typical multiple-lead ECG, however, requires several sticky electrodes to be carefully placed on the body. The clinical users must either confirm that the leads are correctly placed or optimise the leads’ positioning before the recording. Such procedures could preclude frequent assessments of HRV in general populations. By contrast, PPG is simple and only requires a small optical probe to be applied to the skin, and can help reduce possible ‘white coat’ effects on subjects.

HR can be extracted from the AC component of the PPG signal via two different methods. The first method identifies individual heartbeat peaks and determines the time interval between them, and thus the time it takes to complete one cardiac cycle. The second method relies on the identification of the frequency of cardiac pulsations. The energy distribution in the frequency domain of the PPG waveform can be described by transforms such as the Fourier transform. This helps to identify the frequency of the power spike, which can be correlated to HR. The PPG pulse wave, owing to its easy applicability, is expected as a surrogate of ECG for the analysis of HRV. This needs further confirmation.

3.2.3 Measurement of HRV
Heart rate variability measurements were introduced into clinical practice in the 1960s by obstetricians who found decreased variability indicated fetal stress and compromised viability [118]. Since then, computers capable of easily and quickly solving complicated mathematical equations greatly expanded this area of inquiry. Like many other physiological parameters, HRV is influenced by a variety of factors like gender [119], age [120], race [121], circadian rhythm [122], respiration [123], fitness levels [124], posture [125] and physical activity [126]. In 1996, Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) defined and established standards of measurement for clinical application and physiological research [18]. Linear measures, including time domain indices, geometric methods and frequency domain indices, constitute the standard clinical parameters used nowadays. Nonlinear methods are applied to

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

53

measure nonlinear properties of HRV and to reveal the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the cardiovascular system.
3.2.3.1 Time domain methods

The time domain measures of HRV are based on statistical or geometric analysis of the lengths of intervals between successive normal complexes [18].
Statistical measures

The statistical measures using the length of RRI include the mean normal-to-normal (NN) intervals, the standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN), standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals in all 5-minute segments of the entire recording (SDANN), and the mean of the standard deviations of all NN intervals for all 5-minute segments of the entire recording (SDNN index). SDNN reflects all cyclic components in the analysed period and thus depends on the length of the period. It is inappropriate to compare SDNN measures obtained from recordings of different durations.
The most commonly used measures derived from interval differences include the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD), the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms (NN50), and the proportion derived by dividing NN50 by the total number of NN intervals (pNN50). All these measurements of short-term variation estimate high frequency variations in HR and thus are highly correlated.
The methods for expressing overall HRV and its long- and short-term components are not interchangeable. The use of SDNN (an estimate of overall HRV), SDANN (an estimate of the long-term components of HRV) and RMSSD (an estimate of the short-term components of HRV) as time domain measures of HRV are recommended [18].

Geometric measures
Geometrical measures present RRI in geometric patterns, and various approaches have been used to derive measures of HRV from them. The triangular index is a measure, where the length of RRI serves as the x-axis of the plot and the number of

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

54

each RRI length serves as the y-axis. The length of the base of the triangle is used and approximated by the main peak of the RRI frequency distribution diagram. The triangular interpolation of NN interval histogram (TINN) is the baseline width of the distribution measured as a base of a triangle, approximating the NN interval distribution (the minimum of HRV). Triangular interpolation approximates the RRI distribution by a linear function and the baseline width of this approximation triangle is used as a measure of the HRV index [127, 128]. This triangular index had a high correlation with the standard deviation of all RRI. But it is highly insensitive to artefacts and ectopic beats, because they are left outside the triangle. This reduces the need for pre-processing of the recorded data [128]. The major advantage of the geometric methods lies in their relative insensitivity to the analytical quality of the series of NN intervals [129], while the major disadvantage is the need for a reasonable number of RRI and a longer ECG recording. The statistical and geometric measures of HRV are shown in Table 3-1.

3.2.3.2 Frequency domain methods

The time domain methods are computationally simple, but lack the ability to discriminate between sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions of HRV. These studies of HRV employed a power spectral density (PSD) analysis providing the basic information of how power (i.e. variance) distributes as a function of frequency. The HR signal is decomposed into its frequency components and quantified in terms of their relative intensity (power) [130]
Methods for the calculation of PSD may be generally classified as non-parametric and parametric. In most instances, both methods provide comparable results. The advantages of the non-parametric methods are: (a) the simplicity of the algorithm employed (fast Fourier transform—FFT—in most of the cases) and (b) the high processing speed. But these methods, i.e. FFT, suffer from spectral leakage effects due to windowing. The spectral leakage leads to masking of weak signal that are present in the data. The parametric (model based) power spectrum estimation methods avoid the problem of leakage and provide better frequency resolution than nonparametric or classical methods. The advantages of parametric methods are: (a) smoother spectral components which can be distinguished independently of preselected frequency bands, (b) easy post-processing of the spectrum with an automatic calculation of low and high frequency power components and easy identification of the central frequency of each component, and (c) an accurate estimation of PSD even on a small number of samples on which the signal is supposed to maintain stationarity. The basic disadvantage of parametric methods is the need to verify the suitability of the chosen model and its complexity (i.e. the order of the model).

The power spectrum of healthy subjects consists of four major frequency bands. They do not have fixed periods and the central frequencies may vary considerably. The limits for the spectral components usually used [18] are: high frequency (HF) component 0.15-0.4 Hz, low frequency (LF) component 0.04-0.15 Hz, very low frequency (VLF) component 0.003-0.04 Hz, and ultra low frequency (ULF) component <0.003 Hz. To account for inter-individual differences, LF and HF power may also be expressed in normalised units where the absolute value of each power

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

56

component is expressed as a proportion of either total power (e.g. LF/total power) or total power minus the VLF component (e.g. LF/ (total power − VLF power)) [18, 131]. The ratio between LF and HF components (LF/HF ratio) is also used [131, 132]. The normalisation tends to minimise the effect of the changes in total power on the values of the HF and LF components. Nevertheless, normalised units should always be quoted with absolute values in order to completely describe the distribution of power in the spectral components. The frequency domain measures of HRV are listed in Table 3-2.

Frequency domain methods should be preferred to the time domain methods when investigating short-term recordings. It is recommended that the duration of the recording should be at least 10 times the wavelength of the lowest frequency bound of the spectral component investigated [18], and, in order to ensure the stability of the

Chapter 3 Noninvasive cardiovascular assessment

57

signal, should not be substantially extended. Thus, a recording of approximately 1 min is needed to assess the HF components of HRV while approximately 2 minutes are needed to address the LF component. In order to standardise different studies investigating short-term HRV, 5 min recordings of a stationary system are preferred unless the nature of the study dictates another design.

3.2.3.3 Nonlinear analysis methods
Nonlinear phenomena are certainly involved in the genesis of HRV. They are determined by complex interactions of haemodynamic, electrophysiological and humoral variables, as well as by autonomic and central nervous regulations. It has been speculated that analysis of HRV based on the methods of nonlinear dynamics might elicit valuable information for the physiological interpretation of HRV.
Poincaré plot
The Poincaré plot is a simple yet powerful graphical tool to describe the dynamics of a system. In principle, one state of the system (at discrete time n) is plotted versus its state at time step n+1. In the language of nonlinear dynamics this represents a two-dimensional embedding. In a seemingly random signal the Poincaré plot can easily demonstrate whether there is an underlying determinism in the signal. Even in RRI time series which appear extremely erratic, consistent patterns can be extracted by a simple two-dimensional Poincaré plot. There is a fundamental asymmetry in the Poincaré plot from RRI time series. This asymmetry is probably related to strong vagal inputs to the sinus node. Initial attempts to characterise the Poincaré plot qualitatively comprised descriptions of shapes in the embedded time series [133]. This approach, so called gestalt analysis, is, however, subject to different views of the operators. A quantitative approach was used by many researchers [134-137], where the standard deviation of the distance of points to the line of identity was measured.
The technique of fitting an ellipse to the plot is adopted to characterise the shape of the Poincaré plot mathematically, as Figure 3-5 details. A set of axes oriented with the line-of-identity is defined. The axes of the Poincaré plot are related to the new set of axes by a rotation of θ = π / 4 rad:

Figure 3-5. A typical Poincaré plot. An ellipse is fitted to the data points and the Poincaré plot indices are calculated by estimating the short diameter (SD1), the long diameter (SD2) and the ratio of the short and long diameters (SD1/SD2 ratio) of the fitted ellipse. SD1 is the standard deviation of the distances of points from x1 axis, SD2 is the standard deviation of the distances of points from x2 axis.

In the reference system of the new axis, the dispersion of the points around the x1 axis is measured by the standard deviation denoted by SD1. This quantity measures the width of the Poincaré cloud and, therefore, indicates the level of short-term HRV. The length of the cloud along the line-of-identity measures the long-term HRV and is measured by SD2 which is the standard deviation around the x2 axis. These measures are related to the standard HRV measures in the following manner:

relate SD1 to the autocovariance function (The autocovariance function related to the variance of the RRI is given in Appendix A)

SD12 = φRR (0) − φRR (1) .

(3-3)

With a similar argument, it may be shown that the length of the Poincaré cloud is related to the autocovariance function

SD12 = φRR (0) + φRR (1) . By adding (3-3) and (3-4) together, we obtain the result

Recurrence plot

Recurrence plots (RP) are used to reveal nonstationarity of the series. These plots were first proposed by Eckmann et al [138] to visualise the time dependent behaviour of the dynamics of systems, which can be pictured as a trajectory xri ∈ ℜn (i = 1,L, N ) in the n-dimensional phase space. The main step of this visualisation is the calculation of the N×N matrix,

( ) Ri. j = Θ εi − xri − xrj

i, j = 1,L, N ,

(3-7)

where εi is a threshold distance, ⋅ is a norm (e.g. Euclidean norm), and Θ(⋅) the
Heaviside step function. The phase space vectors for one-dimensional time series µi from observations can be reconstructed by using the Taken’s time delay method

( ) xri = µi , µi+τ ,L, µi+(m−1)τ ,

where m is the embedding dimension and τ is the time delay.

One of the major reasons that RP is popular lies in the fact that the structures of RP are visually appealing. The binary values in Ri. j can be simply visualized by a black and white matrix plot. Interpretation of RP is given in Appendix B.

3.3 Summary
PPG enables the noninvasive measurement of the peripheral pulse wave. Interpretation of the PPG pulse wave is based on pattern changes rather than on absolute measurements. Characteristics of the waveform reveal valuable information for circulatory dynamics. The PPG signal, reflecting the fluctuations of the heartbeats, has the potential to noninvasively provide valuable information for cardiovascular monitoring. ‘Heart Rate Variability’ has become the conventionally accepted term to describe variations of both instantaneous heart rate and RR intervals. HRV analysis, including time domain method, geometric method, frequency domain method and nonlinear methods, has been widely used to investigate ANS regulation of cardiovascular function.

pertaining to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) from PPG signal. • Practical examples of PRV for cardiac function assessment. • Development of noncontact reflection PPG (NRPPG) system. • Examining the effectiveness of NRPPG for biomedical monitoring. The experimental setup, protocols and approach are detailed in this chapter.

Five studies, pertaining to noninvasive cardiovascular assessment using the PPG technique, can be briefly described as below:

Study I: the contour analysis of the PPG pulse in a group of young adults; Study II: the compatibility of PRV derived from PPG and HRV derived from ECG; Study III: PRV analysis in smokers and non-smokers; Study IV: the possibility of noncontact PPG instead of contact PPG; Study V: a practical case utilising noncontact PPG for biomedical monitoring.

4.1 Engineering setups
4.1.1 Contact measurement
The lead II ECG signal (Study II) was collected with three electrodes on the right wrist, the left wrist and the right leg of the subjects. Ear PPG signal (Studies II and III) and finger PPG signal (Studies I and II) were recorded from the left ear lobe with an ear clip (MLT1020EC, ADInstruments, Australia) and the index finger with a finger spring clip (MTL1020FC, ADInstruments, Australia). The finger clip, consisting of a reflected infrared light (wavelength: 950 nm), works best where the light can reflect from the bone beneath the tissue. The ear clip uses infrared light (wavelength: 950 nm) transmitted through the tissue. The amplitude of the PPG signal depends primarily on the volume of blood in the capillary bed directly beneath the sensor, so it may be necessary to move the sensor around to find the best signal. The ECG signals were amplified by a low-noise, high-gain differential amplifier (BIO Amp ML135, ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia). The PPG signal and amplified ECG signals were fed continuously into a 16-channel input ADC (PowerLab/16SP, ADInstruments Corporation, Castle Hill, Australia) and recorded in its associated software (Chart 5.2) for further analysis. Figure 4-1 presents the setup for the contact measurement.

4.1.2 Noncontact measurement
4.1.2.1 Noncontact reflection PPG model
A NRPPG model based upon the Beer-Lambert’s law [139] was taken into account to describe the relationship between the light incident on the biological tissue and the light received after transmission through it. This measurement method relies on the varying light absorption due to arterial blood volume change during a cardiac cycle.
Figure 4-2 shows a simplified diagram of the light distribution of the NRPPG model. Ii is the light incident on the skin surface; I0 is the intensity of light penetrating the skin; Ir is the reflected light intensity; and I is the intensity of light emerging from the tissue following a banana-shaped primary light path [140].

Figure 4-2. Simplified representation of light distribution.

The light reaching the photodetector can be separated into non-dynamic (DC) and dynamic (AC) terms. DC consists of the reflected component (Ir) and the static component (from non-variable absorbers, i.e. tissue, bone, static blood etc.), while AC represents the variation of light absorption due to arterial blood volume change. I, thus, can be expressed as:

I = Io exp(−µeff r) = Io exp[−µdynamicd (t) − µstaticm] ,

(4-1)

Chapter 4 Cardiovascular monitoring setup, protocols and approach

65

where µdynamic is the extinction coefficient of the dynamic component, and µstatic is the extinction coefficient of static components. The light path length through the dynamic and static components are d(t) and m, respectively.
The primary target of this study is to calculate pulse rate variability (PRV) derived from PPG signals, in which the accuracy of PRV depends upon the quality of the AC term. Therefore the dynamic (AC) term should be maximised during the measurement period. This can be achieved by maximising the light intensity that travels through the tissue I, while minimising the reflection component of the static signal Ir in order to avoid saturation of the photodetector. The light intensities at the illuminated surface and the detector are given by Ii = Io + Ir and It = Ir + I , respectively. The normalised AC term is directly proportional to I/Ir, and is maximised when Ir is minimised.

The light intensity at the detector can be expanded by applying the Taylor series first order approximation to the dynamic term for the exponential function ( e−x = 1− x, x ≅ 0 ):

It = Ir + Io exp[−µdynamicd (t) − µstaticm] = Ir + Io exp(−µstaticm)[1 − µdynamicd (t)] . (4-2)
From equation (4-2), the static term Ir + Io exp(−µstaticm) is the DC component of the detected signal obtained by low-passing the signal, e.g. 10th order Butterworth [141] (see Appendix C for details), fcut-off: 0.3Hz; and the AC component is Io exp(−µstaticm)µdynamicd (t) , which is obtained by band-passing the signal, e.g. 10th order Butterworth, f1: 0.5Hz, f2: 5Hz. The AC term becomes independent of the light source intensity by normalising the AC with respect to the DC:

AC DC

=

Io exp(−µstaticm)µdynamicd (t) Io exp(−µstaticm)

=

µdynamicd (t) .

(4-3)

Hence the amplitude of the normalised AC is proportional to the time-variant arterial light path length, which in turn depends on the characteristics of the banana-shaped light path. In practice, the reflected light is significant, resulting in an additive term in the denominator of equation (4-3), the minimisation of which results in a maximised

dynamic term.

A high-speed silicon PiN photodiode (Mode: S5821-03, Hamamatsu Photonics UK Limited) with a high sensitivity over the spectral range of 500-1000 nm and the viewing angle of 10º was employed as a photodetector.

UK) were simultaneously captured by a 4-channel PPG board (DISCO4, Dialog Devices Ltd, UK). The analogue-to-digital conversion for these captured PPG signals was implemented by a data acquisition board (USB-6009, National Instruments Co., USA), and the control software of the PPG board was performed by LabView 7.1 (National Instruments Co., USA) running on a Pentium IV computer.
The NRPPG photonics engineering setup was used to find an appropriate geometrical relationship between the positions of the light source and the photodetector. Directly coupled (reflected) light is dependent on the incident angle (θPL). Assuming a point source illumination and a fixed probing area in an empirical noncontact reflection measurement setup, the separation between the point of illumination and the probed area (l), which is determined by the incident angle (θPL) as well as the distance between the photodetector and the tissue (dPH), determine the characteristics of the banana-shape effect. The light source beam has a finite width in practice; therefore, it is necessary to introduce an additional parameter for the separation between the light source and the photodetector (dPL) which determines the characteristics of the illuminated surface. The focus plane of the illuminated tissue varied with the distance of the palm to the photodiode (dPH). Figure 4-3 illustrates the relationship between these parameters.

This process of optimisation for the geometrical characteristics of the NRPPG system aimed to minimise the direct coupling by adjusting incident angle θPL while determining separation dPL for optimum dynamic signal detection. The angle of the photodiode was fixed perpendicular to the tissue. The VCSEL was positioned at an incident angle (θPL) of 35o, 25o and 15o as well as a distance of the sensor placement against the photodiode (dPL) at 15 mm, 25 mm and 35 mm, respectively. The experimental results for the optimisation of sensor placement are presented in Chapter 5.

Figure 4-3. Instrumental hardware setup for NRPPG system illustrating the fundamental parameters. θPL and dPL are the parameters that determine the position of VCSEL and photodiode. By moving the palm close to or further from the photodiode, the focus plane will change position accordingly.
4.2 Protocols
All experiment protocols were approved by both the Ethics Committees of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Loughborough University. Measurements were conducted in a quiet room, at comfortable light and temperature levels. All subjects had no history of cardiovascular abnormality and none were taking medication. All subjects were requested to avoid strenuous exercise, refrain from consuming hot drinks or those containing caffeine, or eating a substantial meal for one hour prior to the studies. The PPG signals were recorded in the supine position (Studies I, II and III) or sitting

position (Studies IV and V) during spontaneous breathing. Subjects were asked to remove any fingerings or earrings prior to the recording session. The subjects’ height and weight were recorded. In study III, smoker subjects were not allowed to smoke one hour before the measurement, as acute smoking may be associated with haemodynamic changes in the cardiovascular system [142]. All gave their informed consent to participate in the study which was approved by the local ethical advisory committee.

In study I, fifteen volunteers (Male/Female [M/F]: 9/6, age: 25.5±4.1 years) participated in the measurement. The subjects are formed into gender and age groups: nine males (age: 26.4±5.1 years), six females (age: 24.0±1.3 years), eight subjects under 25-year-old (age: 22.8±1.4 years), and seven subjects over 25-year-old (age: 28.6±4.0 years).
In study II, fourteen volunteers (M/F: 7/7, age: 25.8±4.2 years) participated in the measurement.
In study III, eight healthy habitual smokers (M/F: 7/1, age: 38.6±17.6 years) having more than 10 cigarettes daily and with over 5 years smoking history, and eight healthy non-smokers (M/F: 7/1, age: 31.6±12.6 years) within the same age range (p=0.51) participated in the measurement.

In study IV, twenty-two healthy subjects (M/F: 12/10, age: 29.0±9.0 years) participated in the measurement. The PPG signals from NRPPG and CPPG system were recorded simultaneously from the right index fingertip and the right palm.

In Study V, the physiological monitoring for one subjects (female, 27 years) was investigated. The PPG signals from the NRPPG setup were collected in the morning and in the afternoon each day during a period of fourteen working days. The PPG signals were recorded for 3 minutes during each recording at the same location of the left palm, where the peripheral arteries are close to the skin surface.

The basic information of the subjects and experimental protocols are presented in Tables 4-1 and 4-2 respectively.

4.3 Physiological parameter measurements
4.3.1 Contour analysis of PPG waveform
In Study I, the PPG pulses for the young adults clearly exhibit first and second peaks as shown in Figure 4-4. The first peak corresponds to a direct forward-travelling pressure wave from the heart to the finger where it produces a change in arterial diameter and hence volume, and the second peak corresponds to the backward-travelling ‘reflected’ pressure wave [107]. A simple and robust algorithm is required to effectively detect and characterise the dicrotic wave since the distinct notches were found to be prevalent in younger individuals [16]. The well-defined dicrotic notch searching algorithm (WDNSA) seeking the “well-defined dicrotic notch (WDN)” between the maximum (a, ya) and the following minimum at (b, yb, ), i.e. local minimum (Figure 4-4) can be principally outlined as follows:
1. For each sample i between a and b, define ji to be the location of the lowest pressure between a and i.
2. Define m to be the sample for which ym – yjm is the greatest (or least negative). Then take (jm, , yjm)to be the dicrotic notch.
3. Mark the dicrotic notch position as successfully found only if ym –yjm is 5% or more of the cycle height.
Not all pulse waveforms with second peak are WDN pulses. Only the waveform with the distinct notch defined by the above algorithm is accounted for WDN pulse. Relevant parameters, i.e. H pulse , Tpeak , Tpulse , H notch and Tnotch , were extracted from the PPG pulses, as shown in Figure 4-4. The absolute and relative vertical and horizontal PPG notch positions were measured. These parameters are given in Table 4-3.

4.3.2 Measurement of HRV and PRV
4.3.2.1 Time Domain measures
The cardiac time intervals were extracted from ECG signal and PPG signal (Studies II and IV). Simple time domain variables include the average HR, the mean HR, the range of NN interval (the difference between the longest and shortest NN interval), and the mean NN interval. The most commonly used measures derived from interval differences comprise SDNN, SDSD, RMSSD, NN50, and pNN50.
4.3.2.2 Frequency domain measures
For HR series or pulse rate series (Studies II and III), Welch’s method [143] (named periodogram method) for estimating power spectra was carried out by dividing the time signal into successive blocks, and averaging squared-magnitude discrete Fourier transform of the signal blocks. In Welch’s method, principally, the data are divided into eight segments with 50% overlap between them. The overlap between segments tends to introduce redundant information; this effect is diminished by the use of a nonrectangular window, which reduces the importance or weight given to the end samples of segments. The averaging of modified periodograms tends to decrease the variance of the estimate relative to a single periodogram estimate of the entire data record. Low frequency (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF: 0.15–0.4 Hz) power components were taken into account. LF and HF were also expressed in normalised units (n.u.) [(absolute power)×100/(total power–VLF power)], where LF(n.u.) and HF(n.u.) represent the relative power component to the total power minus the VLF component [18, 131].
The power spectrum of PPG signal for healthy subjects consists of three major frequency bands (Study IV). They do not have fixed periods and the central frequencies may vary considerably. The limits for the spectral components, according to the heart rate of normal subjects, usually used are: very low frequency component

Chapter 4 Cardiovascular monitoring setup, protocols and approach

74

for PPG signal (pVLF) 0.01-0.5 Hz, low frequency component for PPG signal (pLF) 0.5-1.5 Hz and high frequency component for PPG signal (pHF) 1.5-6 Hz [1].
4.3.2.3 Nonlinear measures

Poincaré plot and Lagged Poincaré plot
The Poincaré plot is an intuitive and commonly used method to assess complex physiological signals in a nonlinear manner. The Poincaré plot was used to outline the PRV measurements and to provide the detailed pulse-to-pulse dynamics (Studies II, IV and V). The dispersion of the points perpendicular to line-of-identity measures the width of the Poincaré plot and reflects the level of short-term PRV (SD1). The dispersion of the points along the line-of-identity measures the length of the plot and is thought to indicate the level of long-term PRV (SD2).
The conventional two-dimensional Poincaré plot, i.e. 1-lagged Poincaré plot, is generated by plotting each RRI as a function of its previous RRI ([RRi, RRi+1]). The clue that the next RRI is determined by the previous ones leads itself to further generalisation with different intervals, i.e. m-lagged Poincaré plots ([RRi, RRi+m], m ≥ 1). In Study III, instead of the plotting RRn, against RRn+1, in conventional two-dimensional Poincaré plots, the plotting of successive pulse-to-pulse intervals was investigated, i.e. PPn against PPn+m, where m is allowed to vary from 1 to 10. In nonlinear dynamics, the 2-D phase space with the time series is embedded with lag m, and the plot is generally still clustered around the line-of-identity. However, the length and the width of the plot are altered as the lag is increased. SD1 and SD2 generalised for lag m are given by [144].

SD1(m)2 = φPP (0) − φPP (m) , SD2(m)2 = φPP (0) + φPP (m) ,
where φPP (m) is the autocovariance function, and is expressed as
[( )( )] φPP(m) = E PPn − PP PPn+m − PP .

(4-4) (4-5)

Chapter 4 Cardiovascular monitoring setup, protocols and approach

75

Considering the facts that m-lagged Poincaré plots can be described as the autocovariance function, and the autocovariance function monotonically decreases with the increasing lag for values of lag less than 10, lags between 1 and 10 for each subject were applied in Study III. SD1m and SD2m were introduced to express the width and the length in m-lagged Poincaré plots, respectively.

Recurrence plot

In Study IV, RP was used to reveal the differences between signals detected from CPPG and NRPPG; and a fixed εi and the Euclidean norm are used, resulting in a symmetric RP.

4.4 Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were expressed as mean I SD (Studies I-V) or median and interquartile range* (Studies II, III and IV). p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Kurtosis and Skewness coefficients were used to assess the probability distributions of the signal series (Study II).

The Kurtosis is defined as:

[ ] Kurtosis

=

E

(X −
σ4

µ )4

,

(4-7)

where X is the data set, i.e. the RRI or PPI series, µ is the mean value of the data set, and σ represents the SD of the data set, and E(t) represents the expected value of the quantity t. The Kurtosis measures how sharply peaked a distribution is, relative to its width. A Kurtosis greater than 3 indicates a leptokurtic data set and a value less than 3 indicates a platykurtic data set.

* interquartile range: the distance from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile

Chapter 4 Cardiovascular monitoring setup, protocols and approach

76

The Skewness is defined as:

[ ] Skewness

=

E

(X −
σ3

µ )3

,

(4-8)

where X is the data set, i.e. the RRI or PPI series, µ is the mean value of the data set, σ represents the standard deviation of the data set, and E(t) represents the expected value of the quantity t. The Skewness measures the asymmetry of the tails of a distribution. A positive Skewness indicates that most of the data are located to the left of the mean and a negative value shows that most of the data are on the right side of the mean.

The agreement analysis between two measurements (HRV and PRV in Study II) or techniques (CPPG and NRPPG in Study IV) was performed using Bland-Altman statistic method. The Bland-Altman ratio is expressed as the half range of limits of agreement (LA) to the mean of the pairwise means (MPM),

Bland − Altman ratio = 0.5 ×[max(LA) − min(LA)] .
MPM

(4-9)

A Bland-Altman ratio up to 0.1 is considered as good agreement [145]. A ratio between 0.1 and 0.2 is considered as moderate agreement. Insufficient agreement for clinical purposes is defined as a Bland-Altman ratio higher than 0.2. The Bland-Altman ratio provides a numerical assessment of agreement between two methods as an alternative to that provided visually by the Bland-Altman plot.

The Bland-Altman plot [146, 147] is based on the mean and standard deviation of the differences between the measurements by the two methods. The x axis of the plot shows the mean of the results of the two methods ([A + B]/2), whereas the y axis represents the absolute difference between the two methods ([B - A]). The standard deviation of the differences between measurements made by the two methods provides a good index of the comparability of the methods. If we can estimate the mean and standard deviation reliably, with small standard errors, we can then say that the difference between methods will be at most two standard deviations on either side of the mean for 95% of observations. These mean±1.96SD limits for the difference are called the 95% limits of agreement.

Correlation is a technique for investigating the relationship between two quantitative, continuous variables. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was calculated as a measure of the strength of the association between two variables (Study I, II and IV). The formula for Pearson’s correlation takes on many forms. The formula applied in this work is shown as follows,

5.1 Dicrotic notch in PPG waveform from young adults
In Study I, the arterial stiffness of the young adults was noninvasively investigated by means of contour analysis of PPG waveform. The waveform information from these young adults is exhibited in Table 5-1, which presents the number of total waveforms, the number of WDN pulses, and their Ratio (Number of WDN pulse/Number of whole waveform) to measure the percentage of the WDN pulse in the whole pulse number.
The characteristics of PPG waveforms are summarised in Table 5-2. The t-tests were performed to express the significance between genders or between different age groups. Three parameters, i.e. NI, PNL and PTNL, were found significantly bigger in the female group than those in the male group (all p<0.02). No significant difference was found for PNRA between genders. The parameter, PNRA, was found significantly bigger in the older group compared to the younger group (p=0.016). No significant difference was found for NI, PNL and PTNL between groups of different age.
The relationships between NI and PNL, NI and PTNL or PNL and PTNL, as shown in Figures 5-1(a), 5-1(c) and 5-1(e), present a highly significant linear correlation with r from 0.8 to 1.0 (all p<0.001). PNRA and PTNL present negative correlation with r=-0.48, as shown in Figure 2(f).
Figure 5-2 shows the correlation between age and parameters. A good correlation (r=0.77, p<0.001) between the parameters of PNRA and age were found, as shown in Figure 5-2(c).

5.2 PPG technique for physiological monitoring

5.2.1 PPG PRV as a surrogate to ECG HRV
In Study II, the HRV derived from ECG and the PRV derived from PPG were compared by computing time and frequency domain parameters. The RRI series derived from ECG signal were used as reference data and compared to the PPI time series derived from PPG signal on the finger tip and the ear lobe. The finger-PRV (fPRV) and ear-PRV (ePRV) features were very similar to those of the HRV. This similarity can be clearly observed in Figure 5-3, where the parameters of the time domain and the frequency domain were used to compare HRV and PRV. The larger DI (ratio of IQR to median value) in this measurement revealed a more dispersed distribution of the parameters. The frequency domain parameters from these fourteen subjects suggested a decentralised distribution.
Bland-Altman ratios were calculated to present the agreements between HRV and PRV. All ratios, indicated in Table 5-3, were below 0.1 except the NN range, where the Bland-Altman ratios were 0.181 for ePRV and 0.157 for fPRV, respectively. The correlation coefficients, presented in Table 5-4, were used to compare ePRV and fPRV with corresponding HRV. Except the range NN, where the correlation coefficients were 0.92 and 0.85 respectively, coefficients deviated only 2% or 1%.
Based on Kurtosis and Skewness coefficients in Table 5-5, the distributions of RRI series and PPI series were similar between each other in all fourteen subjects except for the subjects S7 and S12. The Kurtosis coefficients for PPI from subjects S7 and S12 were both less than 3, indicating that PPI distribution was platykurtic; yet the Kurtosis coefficients for RRI from were both more than 3, showing their leptokurtic distributions. Moreover, the Skewness coefficients for all subjects except subject S2 were positive, indicating the distribution of PPI or RRI was trended on the left side of the mean values of the PPI or RRI data series.
Tables 5-6 and 5-7 present the results of ePRV, fPRV and HRV with the time and the frequency domain for two representative subjects.

The geometrical methods present the shape characteristic of the HRV or PRV, which can visually inspect the ECG or PPG signals, such as disease diagnosis [148], assessment of nonlinear characteristics in HRV [144, 149] and evaluation of paced breathing [150]. Figures 5-4 and 5-5 present the likeness of the characteristics of HRV and PRV in the geometrical shape in individuals.

5.3 Combination of lagged Poincaré plot and spectral characteristics to analyse pulse rate variability
In Study III, a combination of lagged Poincaré plots and spectral characteristics were used to investigate the effect of cigarette smoking on the ANS. Pulse rate variability (PRV), extracted from pulse-to-pulse intervals (PPI) of ear PPG waveforms, was used to obtain HRV information. Spectral power analysis of the PRV was performed to determine LF and HF components, and a lagged Poincaré plot was introduced to evaluate the nonlinear characteristics of PRV. The correlations between lagged Poincaré plot and spectral power indices were studied in the healthy habitual cigarette smokers and compared to non-smokers.

5.3.1 Frequency domain parameters
Spectral power indices of PRV are provided in Table 5-8. Significant reduction (p=0.03) of HF component was found in the smokers. There was no difference between the groups for LF (p=0.16), LF(n.u.) (p=0.75), HF(n.u.) (p=0.63) and the ratio LF/HF (p=0.67).

Table 5-8: Comparisons from frequency domain between habitual smokers and non-smokers. LF: low-frequency power; HF: high-frequency power; LF(n.u.): normalised PRV indices [LF/(LF + HF)]; HF(n.u.): normalised PRV indices [HF/(LF + HF)]; LF/HF: the power ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency.

5.3.2 Lagged Poincaré plots indices

Table 5-9 summarises the lagged Poincaré plot indices for the two groups. Compared to the healthy non-smoker group, the width (SD1m) and the length (SD2m) of lagged Poincaré plots in the smoker group significantly shrunk for all lags (all p<0.05) except SD14 and SD15. In both groups, the relative maximum changes of SD1m and SD2m occurred at lag 6 or lag 7. The relative maximum changes of SD1m were 97.5% for the smoker group and 85.9% for the healthy non-smoker group, respectively, while the relative maximum changes of SD2m were 16.5% and 22.5%, respectively. The ratios of SD1m to SD2m became bigger with the increasing lags in both groups. Yet no significant differences were found for ratios between the two groups.

5.3.3 Correlation between lagged Poincaré plot indices and frequency domain parameters
Figure 5-6 presents the correlation coefficients between lagged Poincaré plot width (SD1m) and spectral power indices (HF, LF, HF(n.u.) and LF(n.u.)) of PRV in the habitual smoker group and the non-smoker group. Moderate (r>0.5) or highly (r>0.7) positive correlations are found between SD1m and HF or LF components as shown in Figure 5-6(a) and 5-6(b). Yet the correlations between SD1m and HF(n.u.) or LF(n.u.) are moderate or poor ( r <0.5). Negative and positive coefficients are found in both groups with the increase of lags as presented in Figures 5-6(c) and 5-6(d). Particularly, the coefficients between SD1m and LF component in the non-smoker group in Figures 5-6(b) and 5-6(d)) are higher than these in the habitual smoker group except for SD110, whereas the similar results are not found in the relationship between SD1m and HF component as presented in Figures 5-6(a) and 5-6(c).
Figure 5-7 shows the correlation coefficients between lagged Poincaré plot length (SD2m) and spectral power indices (HF, LF, HF(n.u.) and LF(n.u.)) of PRV in the two groups. The correlations between SD2m and HF component were all positive as shown in Figures 5-7(a) and 5-7(b). Highly positive correlations between SD2m and HF for all lags were found in the non-smoker group as presented in Figure 5-7(a). Conversely, the highly positive correlations for all lags between SD2m and LF were only found in the smoker group as shown in Figure 5-7 (b). Referring to the correlations between SD2m and HF(n.u.) and LF(n.u.) as presented in Figures 5-7 (c) and 5-7(d), either positive or negative coefficients were found in the non-smokers. For the smoker group, SD2m correlated positively with HF(n.u.) and negatively with LF(n.u.).
The correlation coefficients between two ratios, i.e. SD1m/SD2m and LF/HF, are presented in Figure 5-8. The coefficients move from negative to positive with the increase of the lags for the smoker group. However, such similar changes were not found for the non-smoker group.

5.4 Noncontact PPG as a substitute technique for contact PPG
5.4.1 Geometrical parameters for noncontact reflection PPG photonics engineering setup
In Study IV, depending on the quality of the opto-electronic signal, the detectable range of the distance between the photodetector and palm (dPH) was divided into three ranges:
(1) the saturation range: the opto-electronic signal was captured but the photodetector became saturated easily in some cases;
(2) the optimal range: a cleaner PPG signal was detected without any saturation of photodetector, and also the amplitude of the PPG signal varied with the change of the light source (VCSEL) output; and
(3) the low signal range: the PPG signal was clearly detected with a bigger power of light source, and the PPG signal was sensitive to the interference of ambient light.
As shown in Table 5-10, by increasing the separation distance between the VCSEL and the photodiode from 15 mm to 35 mm and decreasing the incident angle from 15o to 35o, the variations of the three defined ranges were given experimentally. The distance between entry and exit points (l) related to banana-shaped light path in the

three configurations was measured accordingly. Figure 5-9 presents the representative signals captured from the saturation range, the optimal range and the low signal range, respectively.
