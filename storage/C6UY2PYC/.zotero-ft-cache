Channel Mapping
Upon opening the HRV analysis application a prompt will appear allowing the selection of the data file to be analyzed. Once the file is selected, press OK to proceed to the Map Channels screen (Image A).
Note: Please make sure that your computers language format is set to “English (United States)” to assure proper application functionality.
The Map Channels screen is used to identify the physiological data type for each channel in the data file. Although all data types in the file can be defined, not all channels must be assigned a specific data type. Only the ECG channel must be identified for HRV analysis. For respiratory statistics Z0, dZ/dt, or respiration must be identified. When applicable a single Event channel can be identified for event-based analysis. Any channel defined other than this will be ignored in this application.

The left side of the screen shows all events in the file either from Event channel or the BioLab event file with the event name, type, and time. There are three controls for specifying the way in which the events are viewed:
Use Event File: When checked the events displayed are from the selected event file. Otherwise they are detected in the channel mapped as Event. Filter Events: Used to filter the events in the list by type Event Identifier: Specifies whether the event name or type is used as identifier. This affects both the identification of which events to use for analysis and how the events are displayed during analysis.
Select Mode (2, Image C)
Time Mode (Image D): In time mode, the following parameters are available: Start Time (9): Used to set the time at which the first analysis segment will start. Segment Time (10): Specifies the length of each segment, starting at the start time and splitting the remainder of the file into equal length segments. End Time (11): Used to set time at which the last analysis segment will end.
Event Mode (Image D): The list to the left of the event controls (8) displays all of the events detected in either the event file or the channel mapped to “Event”. This can be changed by either marking or unmarking the box named “Use Event File” above the event list. This list can be filtered by type.

Post Event: The Post-Event Time slider (7) specifies the length of the data after the specified event that is included in the segment. Pre + Post: A combination of the Pre Event and Post Event modes in which the pre and post event segments are shown as a single segment. Pre and Post: A combination of the Pre Event and Post Event modes in which the pre and post event segments are shown as separate segments. Event to Event + Time: Post Event Time slider specifies a amount of time to 		 segment analysis between the chosen events. Event to Event: In this mode, the length of the segment is defined by the time in between the current event and the next event in the list.
For each of these event modes there is the option to use all events in the list or to specify certain events to use when segmenting the data. A specific event can be chosen from the event list by first selecting “User Defined” in the Event to Use box (2), and then selecting the desired event from the list that will appear in the box labeled “Event Type” (3). User Defined events also enable the ability to select all events with identical names for analysis with the “All Instances” (5) check box. In Event to Event mode, two specific events to go between can be selected. The number of events box (4) shows the total number of events of the specified type which will be shown during analysis.

Image Q
This screen will either appear on its own, or along with the standard Analysis screen depending on the setting on the Setup screen. On this screen, a plot is shown for each of the selected HRV statistics. As these statistics are calculated second by second, their values appear in their respective charts. This screen can be expanded to display more plots at a time, or these additional plots are available by scrolling down. The following options are available (Image Q):
Pause (1): Will temporarily stop the calculation of the real time stats. Resume (2): Will continue the calculation of the statistics (Only available 		 when analysis is paused). Exit (3): This control will end the calculation of real time stats and close this 		 window.

Signal Editor

ECG Editor:
This screen can be accessed by clicking the green “Edit R’s” button at the top of the Analysis Screen.
The ECG Editor (Image R), is an easy to use, yet powerful tool allowing for the modification of the placement of ECG R- peaks detected programmatically from the peak detection algorithm. It is a graphical based editor and will carry any modification that is made back to the analysis screen. The editor has built in artifact detection algorithms and will dynamically update the graph as points are edited.
There are two waveforms visible from within the editor. Displayed in red is the ECG time series with the peaks marked in light blue. Displayed in blue is the respiration time series.

There is also a set of green horizontal cursors and blue vertical cursors. By selecting the

crosshair tool under the graph the user can move the position of these cursors and then

click the Delete all Points between X Cursors or Delete all Points between Y Cursors, all

peaks detected between their respective cursors will be deleted. This is especially helpful

for removing large T components of ECG. This will only remove the markers on the ECG

waveform.

Image R2

ECG waveform graph (Image R2): The ECG waveform is displayed in red. The blue markers denote the R peaks as detected from the peak detection algorithm. The yellow circular markers with cross hair markers denote potential artifact detected by the error detection algorithms. The Y values are scaled in volts and the X values are in time (seconds). The graph tools window in the bottom left has three tools for aid in editing. The tool with the cross hairs should be used for inserting and/or deleting points and takes the form of a circle that can be scaled in size to manage more or less points. The size of the circle is directly linked to the sensitivity bar and can be controlled with that or the tracking wheel on mouse. The second tool, the magnifying glass, can be used to zoom in on the graph. The third tool, the hand, is used to scroll through the entire data set. The control in the bottom left corner can be used to zoom out the graph after zooming in by clicking on the X or Y button to zoom the graph back to its original position. This graph also contains cursors used to delete multiple points simultaneously. These cursors can be dragged freely to a desired location.

Size of Graph (seconds) (1): The Size of Graph control determines how much of the waveform to display at once. This value can be changed to fit less data onto the screen at once much like a zoom window.
Snap to Peak Control (2): The snap to peak switch when in the “On” position will enable the snap to peak algorithm for point insertion. When the snap to peak switch is in the “OFF” position, it disables the snap to peak algorithm and allows for manual insertion of a point at the point clicked upon within the graph indicator. To successfully insert a point using the snap to peak setting, the user must also click the mouse within a band defined by the sensitivity control. The lower the sensitivity control, the more precisely the user must click on the exact spot of desired insertion. The higher the sensitivity control, the less precise the user needs to be, but this can cause point insertion at a place other than the desired point and removal of too many points when deleting.
Midbeat Auto Peak Control (3): When the Midbeat Auto Peak Control is in the “On” position the mid beat algorithm is enabled. When the switch is in the “Off” position the midbeat control will mark a position exactly half way between the two selected points.
Cursor Lines Information (4): This section gives the location of the x and y line cursors and the distance between then in numeric values.

Settings Continued (Image T):
X0 (seconds) (1): The X0 control determines where to start the graph in time. The user can slide this control to move their way through the segment in the edit screen.
Auto-Track Cursors (2): When activated, the cursors will retain their position on the screen as the data is scrolled through. When off, the cursors keep their position in the data and can leave the screen if scrolled past.
Resp or dZ/dt Color (3): This color box shows the current color of the respiration or dZ/dt plot. Clicking this control allows the user to change the color of this plot.

Set X Cursor Position (1): The Set X Cursor Position brings up a window through which the

user can set the high and low position of the X cursors by changing their numerical value.

The Cursor Pos X Low and Cursor Pos X High show these settings.

Set Y Cursor Position (2): The Set Y Cursor Position brings up a window through which the

user can set the high and low position of the Y cursors by changing their numerical value. The Cursor Pos Y Low and Cursor Pos Y High show these settings.

Delete (F1) (3): This control latches when pressed until pressed again. If the points are within the range defined by the sensitivity control and the mouse click they will be deleted.

Note: Sensitivity is represented by cursor circle that can be scaled in size to manage more or less points. The scaling is directly linked to the sensitivity bar and can be controlled with that or the tracking wheel on mouse.

Insert (F2) (4): This control latches when pressed until pressed again. If the points are within the range defined by the sensitivity control (visible as scalable cursor circle) and the mouse click they will be inserted at the point of the mouse click or at the peak defined by the snap to peak window control above as long as snap to peak is on.

Delete All Points Between X Cursors (5): All points within the boundary defined by the

vertical blue cursors will be removed.

Delete All Points Between Y Cursors (6): All points within the boundary defined by the

horizontal green cursors will be removed.

Remove Data Portion (7): This control will remove all data within the boundary defined by

the cursors.

Midbeat (8): This control will mark a Midbeat point between two points selected with the X cursors.

Reset (9): This control resets the R peaks to the original state when the editor was first

entered.

Appendix A

The next screen in the conversion process is the Text File Conversion Wizard. From this screen, details about the data in the text file must be entered in order to properly scale and display the data in the analysis applications. It is extremely important that these values are identical to the way the data was acquired to ensure the correct conversion.
A/D Resolution: This control is the resolution of the A/d converters in the hardware used to acquire the data in the file.
VFs: This control is the volts full scale of the hardware used to acquire the data in the file.
Sampling Frequency (Hz): This control is the sampling frequency at which the data in the file was collected.
Data Type: This control specifies whether the data in the file is in volts or A/d counts.
Channel Delimiter: This control specifies the character which is used to separate data channels in the file.
Below these settings is the submenu control. The following submenus are available:
File Header: This submenu contains a preview of the beginning of the selected text file. Using the controls Data Start Column and Data Start Row, select where the data actually begins in the file past any file header information. Rows and columns which will not be included in conversion appear in red.
Channels 1-16: This submenu contains the channels found in the text file and allows for them to be selected/deselected for conversion.

The following controls are available: Channel Names: This control allows the user to specify a name for the data channel to be saved in the .mw file header. Scaling Type: This control specifies whether the data in the file is scaled or 		 unscaled. If the data is scaled, the Scale Factor and Offset fields will be enabled for modification. Scale Factor: If the data in the specified channel is scaled, this control represents 		 the factor by which it is scaled. Offset: This control represents the offset of the scaled data channel.
Submenus Channels 17-32 and Channels 33-48 behave in the same way. Pressing OK will convert the file to the .mw format (may take several minutes depending on size of data file) and return to the Setup screen. Pressing cancel will return to the file selection window.
