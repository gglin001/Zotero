Title:          How Effective Is Pulse Arrival Time for Evaluating Blood Pressure? Challenges and Recommendations from a Study Using the MIMIC Database
Subject:        Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of non-infectious morbidity and mortality in the world. The detection, measurement, and management of high blood pressure play an essential role in the prevention and control of CVDs. However, owing to the limitations and discomfort of traditional blood pressure (BP) detection techniques, many new cuff-less blood pressure approaches have been proposed and explored. Most of these involve arterial wave propagation theory, which is based on pulse arrival time (PAT), the time interval needed for a pulse wave to travel from the heart to some distal place on the body, such as the finger or earlobe. For this study, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database was used as a benchmark for PAT analysis. Many researchers who use the MIMIC database make the erroneous assumption that all the signals are synchronized. Therefore, we decided to investigate the calculation of PAT intervals in the MIMIC database and check its usefulness for evaluating BP. Our findings have important implications for the future use of the MIMIC database, especially for BP evaluation.
