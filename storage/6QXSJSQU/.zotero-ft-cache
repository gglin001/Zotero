Abstract
Real‐time cardiovascular assessment is vital for monitoring patients at an early stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), at risk of reoccurrence of heart attacks and strokes and during pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments. Blood Pressure (BP), Arterial Stiffness (AS) and Blood Viscosity (BV) are three essential parameters that can provide a reliable assessment of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hyperviscosity associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular pathologies to complex stages. The currently available methods designed for evaluation of such parameters incur limitations and challenges that stand as an obstacle to the development of non‐invasive, portable and reliable all‐in‐one device intended for personal use. This project engaged in novel fundamental and rigorous in vivo and in vitro investigations in an effort to shed more light on the photoplethysmographic signals (AC and DC) during induced changes of BP, AS, and BV. The underlying hypothesis is to show for the first time that Photoplethysmography (PPG) has the potential to non‐invasively assess, in a qualifying and quantifying manner, the above parameters. Positives outcomes from such approach will establish the potential of the PPG as a preferential monitoring (screening and possible diagnosis) technique for the assessment of CVDs.
Novel miniature PPG sensors were developed along with a state of the art PPG processing unit, a data acquisition system and a customised manuscript for offline signal analyses. ECG and temperature processing systems were also designed and developed for use in the in vivo investigations. State of the art in vitro experimental rig was developed to mimic the human circulation under a wide range of flow conditions. A pilot volunteer investigation highlighted the effect of a cold pressor test in one hand on the PPG signals from both hands. The results indicated that there are changes in flow regulation mechanisms and hemodynamics besides the expected vasoconstriction effects of local cooling. These findings led to the controlled in vitro experiments. The in vitro investigations were completed in four stages where the potential of the PPG to provide a measure of blood pressure values, volume elastic modulus (Ev) and to detect fluid viscosity and haemorheological changes.
Results from the in vitro investigations highlighted that Adjusted Pulse Volume (APV) was found to be the optimum method for measuring BP values using Red (R) and Infrared (IR) wavelengths as validated under a range of BP values simulating hypotensive to hypertensive scenarios. The correlation was significant with Rsquare ranging between 0.96 and 0.99 for different arterial models and circulating fluids. Moreover, a proposed mathematical derivation allowed the PPG to provide a direct measure of AS using Ev. The method showed strong agreement with the gold standard measurement of material testings, the Instron device, with a percent error of 0.26% and 1.9% for different arterial models. Furthermore, the PPG signals also responded to changes in rheological characteristics in relation to fluid viscosities, the presence of the red blood cells, changes in shear rates and blood clotting.
These results strongly suggest that PPG has the potential to be used as a non‐invasive and continuous method for the assessment of cardiovascular disease markers such as blood pressure, arterial stiffness and blood viscosity.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from early childhood to old age globally (Laslett et al., 2012). In 2013, CVDs resulted in 17.3 million deaths (31.5%) compared to 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990 (Townsend et al, 2014). The most interesting fact reported in the literature is that 90% of CVDs are preventable (McGill et al., 2008). On this ground, this project will focus on the potential and limitations of Photoplethysmography (PPG) as a non‐invasive and continuous device for cardiovascular assessment. There are three major determinants of CVD at an early stage; hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hyperviscosity. The three parameters have been associated with the progression of CVD and morbid events (Coull et al., 1991; Hansen et al., 2006; Hirai et al., 1989; Jan et al., 1975; Turczyński et al., 2002). They have been identified as the earliest determinants of the preclinical CVD. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hyperviscosity can be assessed with measurement of Blood Pressure (BP), Arterial Stiffness (AS) and Blood Viscosity (BV), respectively. The three parameters interact together, and it is only plausible to study them combined. An abnormal value or behaviour in one of those parameters tend to result in a positive feedback loop of plaque formation, increased vascular resistance, blood aggregation, and heart overload. This loop may stabilise, but sometimes it accelerates and eventually leads to catastrophic events of thrombosis, heart attacks, strokes, and anginas.
There is no currently available medical device designed for practical, non‐invasive, continuous personal use at an affordable price for full cardiovascular assessment. The available techniques are used to perform measurements or estimations of the parameters separately.
A variety of methods is available for non‐invasive Blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, these methods are mostly intermittent, which incurs limitations due to the unavailable data during the time between the two measurements. Continuous blood pressure measurements and estimations include the vascular unloading method and the

Introduction

pulse wave velocity. Both are not considered reliable to replace classical methods of blood pressure measurements and are not available for personal use.
Arterial stiffness (AS) has been recognised as an independent predictor of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk mainly through Pulse wave velocity and ultrasound measurement methods. However, a host of indices is found in the literature that provides an indirect estimation of AS. None of these methods is capable of providing a direct measure of the elastic modulus for accurate quantification of AS for clinical or personal use. Moreover, some studies have questioned the reliability of these indices due to the low correlation between them, especially when the study groups are adjusted for age and gender (Jerrard‐ Dunne et al., 2008).
Elevated blood viscosity values, or hyperviscosity, have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk (Coull et al., 1991; Fossum et al., 1997; Lowe et al., 1997; Turczyński et al., 2002). However, the parameter received little attention in the development of diagnostic methods and is virtually non‐existent in the Photoplethysmograph. Currently available commercial devices for measurement of blood viscosity are limited to industrial devices and are not particularly designed for clinical use. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has been widely applied in the pulse oximeter for the estimation of blood oxygen saturation. However, beyond this application, the PPG signal is believed to contain information related to the blood circulation (Shelley, 2007). Nonetheless, most studies rely on the assumption that the PPG is purely a resultant of volume changes in the vascular bed, and only a limited amount of studies have addressed the possibility of other factors affecting the PPG signal, such as haematocrit values (Ochoa and Ohara, 1980) and wall stiffness (Kamshilin et al., 2015).The main focus of this project is to investigate the AC and DC components of the PPG and the potential of the technique to be used as a diagnostic method for cardiovascular assessment. More specifically this work focuses in the utilising of PPG in the measurement of BP, AS, and BV. This is achieved through original investigations of the PPG as a technique addressing fundamental‐based questions such as:
1. To what extent does the fluid volume contribute to the generation of the AC and DC components of the PPG signal?
2. How are the AC and DC PPG signals affected by radial pressure (stress on inner walls)?
3. How does wall elasticity affect both components of the PPG signal?

Introduction

4. How do pumping frequency and stroke volume affect the signal in conjunction with other factors, such as fluid volume, geometry, and arterial stiffness?
5. What is the role of fluid viscosity in the generation of both components of the PPG signal?
6. Does blood rheology affect both components of the PPG signal?
These questions resulted in the design of a series of in vivo and in vitro investigations that consider these factors and lead to address the application‐based questions:
7. What are the limitations of the PPG technique as a diagnostic medical for a general and reliable method for cardiovascular assessment, including blood pressure measurements, arterial stiffness and blood viscosity?
1.2 Chapters Overview
Chapter 2 covers the basic physiological background of the cardiovascular system with emphasis on blood pressure and flow regulation methods and blood rheological properties. The chapter also describes the major cardiovascular diseases that are known to develop at early stages (before the occurrence of heart attacks, strokes, and anginas) such as, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and hyperviscosity. This is followed by a brief overview of some of the basic principles of the physics of blood flow.
Chapter 3 describes the current state of the art in the assessment of cardiovascular risks and provides an overview of the available methods and devices for measurement of blood pressure, estimation of arterial stiffness. The chapter also covers current methods for clinical testing of blood viscosity and possible methods that are being investigated in the research community.
Chapter 4 provides an in‐depth overview of the principles of light properties, pathways, and interaction in biological tissues. The chapter also highlights results obtained from optical interactions with skin, blood mediums and the major chromophores.
Chapter 5 is dedicated to an overview of Photoplethysmography. The chapter covers the basic principles of the technique, modes of operation and early and recent history of the origin of the technique. The chapter highlights the most common applications of the PPG and the associated limitations.
Chapter 6 describes the incremental design and development of the PPG probes that will be utilised in the in vivo (finger probes) and in vitro (tube probes) investigations. The chapter includes the design considerations, the chosen components and their

12

Introduction

specifications and the manufacturing procedure. This chapter also describes the design and development of the temperature measurement system which will be used for the evaluation of the finger probes and later on in the in vivo investigation. A section for the evaluation of the fabricated finger and tube probes will be presented.
Chapter 7 covers the design and development of the hardware and software used for processing, recording and analysing the PPG signals. The design of the dual channel, dual wavelength PPG processing system includes the mechanical, electrical descriptions of the system along with an evaluation of the system’s performance. The design and development of the ECG system are also included. The chapter includes a description of the designed data acquisition system along with the chosen acquisition cards and the development of the virtual instrument in LabVIEW for the in vivo and in vitro investigations. A description of the custom written Matlab script used for offline analysis of the collected PPG and ECG signals is also included.
Chapter 8 describes the first in vivo investigation of PPG, ECG and temperature signals in healthy volunteers undergoing a cold pressor test in one hand. The study motivation, protocol, data acquired, and the statistical analysis is presented. The study highlights the response of AC amplitudes and DC levels of the PPG signals in both hands and underlines the need for controlled in vitro investigations.
Chapter 9 describes the development of the in vitro setup. The setup was designed to mimic human blood circulation and allows investigations of the PPG signals under controlled scenarios of flow conditions while acquiring pressure and flow velocity signals. A summary of the in vitro investigations protocol is listed. The chapter covers the evaluation of the developed system by observing flow patterns in the arterial models.
Chapter 10 presents the first in vitro investigation of PPG, pressure and flow signals in an arterial model under varied conditions of flow and pressure. This is achieved by control of stroke volumes and pumping frequencies in two arterial models with different cross‐sectional areas. A proposed method for measurement of systolic pressure values using normalised and adjusted pulse volumes is validated.
Chapter 11 addresses the effect of wall stiffness on the PPG signal by acquiring PPG, pressure and flow signals from the in vitro setup from two arterial models with different wall stiffness properties. A proposed method for measurement of the elastic Modulus is validated with the standard gold method. The method shows strong agreement and proposes that PPG can be used for direct measurement of wall elastic modulus.

Introduction

Chapter 12 reports on the effect of fluid viscosity on the PPG components. The study acquires PPG, pressure, and flow signals from the in vitro setup while circulating two fluids with similar optical properties and different viscosities. The chapter motivation, protocol, data acquired, and statistical analysis are presented. This chapter highlights that both components of the PPG signal are sensitive to fluid viscosity.
Chapter 13 presents the results highlighting the role of blood rheology on the PPG signal. It addresses the role of the presence of the vesicle‐shaped red blood cells, the effect of different shear rates and finally the influence of thromboplastin activation on the AC and DC components of the PPG signals.
Chapter 14 discusses results and observations made in previous chapters (8, 10,11,12 and 13) and presents final conclusions, remarks, limitations, and suggestions for future work.

2.1 Introduction
The main focus of this project is the applications of Photoplethysmography (PPG) in the assessment of cardiovascular health, primarily, the interaction of the photoplethysmographic signal with blood flow. Previous studies since the 1930s have recorded and observed the synchronised PPG signal with the heartbeat from a skin surface. Therefore, it is essential to develop an understanding of the main contributors to the pulsatile signal in blood circulation from an anatomical, physiological and physical point of view.
Blood flow and pressure are regulated by the cooperation of multiple systems in the human body; the nervous system, the respiratory system, the circulatory system, and the urinary system as seen in Figure 2-1. This Chapter will present a brief overview of the role of the nervous system in blood flow and pressure regulation, a physiological and anatomical description of the cardiovascular system. A brief description of cardiovascular diseases and their symptoms of hypertension, atherosclerosis and hyperviscosity will also

be presented. We will also provide some fundamentals of the physics of the flow in elastic arteries.

2.2 The Nervous‐Cardiovascular Interaction
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the component of the peripheral nervous system that controls cardiac muscle contraction, visceral activities, and glandular functions of the body. Specifically, the ANS can regulate heart rate, blood pressure, the rate of respiration, body temperature, sweating, gastrointestinal motility and secretion, as well as other visceral activities that maintain homoeostasis (Rhoades and Bell, 2012). The ANS functions continuously without conscious effort and is controlled by centres located in the spinal cord, brain stem, and hypothalamus. Those centres receive signals from different receptors in the body as summarised in Figure 2-2.
The ANS has two interacting systems: the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic and parasympathetic neurones exert antagonistic effects on the heart. The sympathetic system prepares the body for energy expenditure, i.e. fight or flight. Conversely, the parasympathetic system is more active under restful conditions. The parasympathetic counteracts the sympathetic system after a stressful event and restores the body to a restful state. The sympathetic system releases norepinephrine (NE) while the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine (Ach). At any given time, the
16

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

effect of the ANS on the heart is the net balance between the opposing actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems (Shusterman and Barnea, 2005). In relation to the circulatory system, the stimulation of the sympathetic system causes an increase in heart contractility (inotropic effects) of both atriums and ventricles, blood vessel constriction and enhancement of conduction (dromotropic effects) by increasing the AV conduction velocity. The parasympathetic stimulation decrease heart rates (negative chronotropic effect), decrease conduction velocity (negative dromotropic effects) and it is a matter of debate if this stimulation affects myocardial contractility. However, it is suggested that it can cause a decrease in heart contractility (Brahme, 2014).

2.3 The Cardiovascular System
The cardiovascular system comprising the heart, blood vessels, and blood is responsible for supplying nutrients and metabolic products to every living cell in the human body, which is to be estimated approximately at 10^14 cells (Zamir, 2005).

Figure 2-3 Illustration of human heart anatomy showing the systematic and pulmonary circulations (Tortora and Derrickson, 2008).
2.3.1 The Heart
The heart consists of four chambers as illustrated in Figure 2-3: Two ventricles and two atria, which contract and relax rhythmically. The two ventricles eject blood, and both atria act as receiving chambers for returning blood. In the pulmonary circuit, blood that is high in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen flows from the right heart to the lungs. In the capillaries of the lungs, blood takes on oxygen and offloads carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs to the left heart. In the systemic circuit, oxygenated blood flows from the left heart to the systemic tissues. Systemic capillaries are the site of exchange of nutrients and wastes. The blood offloads oxygen to the tissues
18

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

and picks up carbon dioxide wastes. Deoxygenated blood then flows from the systemic tissues to the right heart, completing the circuit (Iaizzo, 2010).
The pulmonary arterial system starts at the pulmonary valves. The main pulmonary artery (pulmonary trunk), like the aorta, has sinuses behind the valve cusps. In humans the trunk is 5–6 cm in length and 2.5–3.0 cm in diameter, and it passes upwards and backwards, as shown in Figure 2-3, to lie beneath the aortic arch, where it divides into the right and left main pulmonary arteries. These pass towards the corresponding lungs, but before entering them, they divide into several branches, which supply the different lobes (Iaizzo, 2010; Tortora and Derrickson, 2008).
2.3.1.1 Pacemaker Cells The heart is the pump that drives that circulation. It pumps continuously by contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic pattern initiated by electrical impulses, the rate which those impulses spark, controls the heart rate. Those impulses are originated in the pacemakers’ cells in the heart. Under normal conditions, pacemakers are responsible for initiating their own potentials, and they are the source of current that flows through the heart, causing depolarization and contraction of the cardiac myocytes. Pacemaker cells are present in the SinoAtrial node (SA node) and the AtrioVentricular node (AV) (Courneya, 2010).
Action potentials that originate in the SA node spread to the myocardial cells of the atria through gap junctions between cells. Depolarization of the atria stimulates contraction of the atrial myocardium. Action potentials cannot directly spread from the atrial myocardium to the ventricular myocardium due to the presence of the non‐conducting fibrous skeleton that separates them. Rather, the impulse travels to the ventricles through a system of specialised cells called the conduction system (Aaronson et al., 2012).
2.3.1.2 The Conduction System The conduction system consists of the atrioventricular node (AV node), Bundle of His, bundle branches and Purkinje fibres. After the action potential has spread across the atria, it travels to the AV node. At the AV node, the impulse is delayed for a brief period of time to allow the ventricles to fill with blood before ventricular contraction occurs. The impulse travels from the AV node into the Bundle of His and then moves into both bundle branches. The impulse travels to the apex of the heart before travelling into the ventricular walls through Purkinje fibres. The impulse then spreads throughout the ventricular myocardium by way of gap junctions between myocardial cells.

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

Depolarization of the ventricles causes contraction of the ventricular myocardium (Marieb, 2000).
2.3.1.3 The Fluid Heart The heart does not only function as a mechanical pump. Many investigators have pointed out that the pattern of the fluid movement as it is ejected from the heart plays a major role in the ability of the fluid to propagate along the blood vessels in the body. The fluid movement in the body emerges from the myocardium; which forms most of the heart and consists of muscle fibres. The outer muscle fibre starts at the upper part of the heart and sweeps down in counterclockwise curves to the tip (apex) of the heart. At that point, they loop around and form the heart vortex (vortex cordis), they loop more to form the vortex pattern, some of those fibres spread around the papillary muscles that move the atrioventricular valves (Pedrizzetti et al., 2015; Peskin and McQueen, 1992).
Most muscle consists of about 75% water. The looping pattern of the heart fibres, including the vortex, forms an image of fluid movement as illustrated in Figure 2-4. On the events of the contraction of the myocardium, the blood that streams through the heart also creates loops and vortices. This movement drawn by the spiralling fibres of the heart is very intricate (Lipowsky, 2005; Wong et al., 2008; Kocica et al., 2006).

This energy that is delivered to the blood, part of it dissipates through viscosity, another part is stored in the elastic structure, and the remainder is stored in the kinetic energy of the blood. Though some of that elastic energy is stored in the fluid during the initiation

of flow due to the elastic properties of red blood cells, its presence is hidden from observation when the flow reaches a steady state. This means the steady flow measurements reflect only the rate of energy dissipation. Because early studies of blood flow were carried using quiescent fluid model only –it was not possible to provide the complete basis of understanding pulsatile flow in the circulation (How, 1996).
2.3.2 Blood Vessels: Anatomical and Mechanical Properties
Blood is transported around the body in three different types of blood vessels: arteries, capillaries, and veins. Each blood vessel is composed of three layers of tissue. From inside in they are the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica external (Ethier and Simmons, 2007). An illustration of blood vessel types labelled with tissue layers is presented Figure 2-5. Tissue layers are labelled in reference to Table 2-1(Primal Pictures, 2015).

2.3.2.1 Arteries

Arteries carry blood away from the heart to other organs. Their size and wall thickness

vary depending on their vicinity to the heart, i.e., large arteries with thick elastic walls

carry blood being pumped directly from the heart, and arteries smaller in diameter with

thinner walls deliver blood to the extremities (Ethier and Simmons, 2007). Arteries have

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

and elastic thickness than in veins, enabling their walls to stretch easily with a small increase in blood pressure (high compliance) (Ethier and Simmons, 2007).
Three main types of arteries are defined: elastic arteries, muscular arteries, and arterioles.
Elastic arteries Elastic arteries are also referred to as conducting arteries, are large and conduct blood from the heart to muscular arteries. They have well defined internal and external elastic laminae, and their tunica media is thick and full of elastic fibres (elastic lamellae), enabling their walls to stretch easily with an increase in blood pressure (high compliance), as seen during systole. They propel blood from the heart during ventricular diastole (Iaizzo, 2010). Their elastic properties are essential to accommodate the volume of blood created when blood is expelled from the heart. As they stretch, elastic fibres store mechanical energy, which is converted into kinetic energy as the elastic fibres recoil and force the blood away from the heart such as the aorta, subclavian, common iliac, and common carotid arteries (Ethier and Simmons, 2007).
Muscular (medium) arteries Muscular arteries are also referred to as distributing arteries, as they repeatedly branch until reaching their target organs. They are less elastic than the conducting arteries as they do not have to deal with the same degree of pressure changes. They have well‐ defined internal but thin external elastic laminae. Depending on the size of the artery, the thick tunica media is made up of 3‐40 concentrically arranged layers of smooth muscle cells (Courneya and M.D, 2010; Iaizzo, 2010). The tunica externa is often thicker than the tunica media, consisting of longitudinally oriented fibroblasts, collagen fibres, and elastic fibres. The loose arrangement of these cells enables arteries to alter their diameter. The lack of elastic fibres in the walls of muscular arteries means that recoil does not propel the blood as in elastic arteries. Instead, smooth muscle cells maintain a state of partial contraction or vascular tone, ensuring that vessel pressure and efficient blood flow are sustained and enable efficient adjustment of the rate of blood flow by vasoconstriction and vasodilation (Safar et al., 2014).
Arterioles Arterioles also referred to as resistance vessels, are numerous, microscopic arteries that feed blood into capillary networks. Vessel diameter varies from 15‐300 μm depending on the location, and their wall thickness is about half the total diameter. The tunica interna is thin, with a porous internal elastic lamina that diminishes as the arteriole tapers

23

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

towards its terminal end and continues as a capillary (Aaronson et al., 2012). The muscular tunica media is made up of one to two concentrically arranged layers of smooth muscle cells. A smooth muscle cell forming the precapillary sphincter demarcates the junction and controls the flow of blood between a metarteriole and its adjoining capillary. The tunica externa contains unmyelinated sympathetic nerves and loose connective tissue. Along with local chemical mediators, the sympathetic nerve supply of the arteriole triggers vasoconstriction and vasodilation, regulating the rate of blood flow, blood pressure, and vascular resistance. The smaller the vessel diameter, the higher the vascular resistance and the slower the rate of blood flow (Safar et al., 2014).
2.3.2.2 Capillaries Capillaries are short, branched, interconnecting vessels that form networks within nearly every structure of the body, bridging the gap between arterioles and venules. A micro‐ circulation exists as blood flows from a metarteriole, through capillaries, into a postcapillary venule. Structurally, capillaries lack both tunica media and tunica externa. Their thin, one layer epithelial structure and vast surface area make for rapid exchange of small molecules, such as glucose, and the diffusion of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, between blood and cellular interstitial fluid (Iaizzo, 2010). Capillaries also referred to as exchange vessels, have a diameter varying between 5‐10 μm. Red blood cells, 8 μm in diameter, must, therefore, deform in order to fit through smaller capillaries. A capillary wall is approximately 0.2 micrometres (0.02 mm) thick and is composed of a single layer of endothelial cells adhered to a basement membrane. Capillary networks provide a large surface area in contact with tissues throughout the body (Aaronson et al., 2012).
2.3.2.3 Veins The systemic veins begin at the venules, where the capillaries join together and end where the venae cavae enter the right atrium. They carry blood back to the heart from the extremities and organs of the body. Their size varies from about 0.5 mm in diameter to 3 cm, depending on their proximity to the heart. Veins generally have very thin walls in relation to their diameter. Their thin walls and ability to unfold contribute to their high distensibility. In certain regions, veins can be seen to widen, forming vascular or venous sinuses, structurally different from regular veins (Caro, 2012). They have thin endothelial walls, with a complete lack of smooth muscle, leaving them reliant upon surrounding connective tissue for support. Veins are more numerous than arteries and often appear as pairs. Superficial veins spread throughout the subcutaneous layer, deep

24

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

to the skin, and deep veins run between skeletal muscles. Connections exist between the two, called anastomotic veins (Aaronson et al., 2012).
Venules Venules, like arterioles, are numerous and microscopic. However, their walls are much thinner. Postcapillary venules are continuous with capillary networks. They are small in diameter, 10‐50 μm, and have gaps between the endothelial cells that make up their walls. As venules extend further from their capillary networks, they become larger in diameter, 50‐200 μm, and more muscular with more layers of concentrically arranged smooth muscle cells (Caro, 2012). Venules drain blood from the capillary networks and feed the return flow of blood to the veins. Postcapillary venules function as an exchange unit, however, the larger, thicker walled venules do not (Ethier and Simmons, 2007).
Medium veins Medium veins are around 1 cm in diameter. They have all three layers of a typical blood vessel: the tunica externa is the thickest layer, consisting of collagen and elastic fibres; the tunica media, lacking in smooth muscle and elastic fibres, is thin along with the tunica interna (Caro, 2012). They do not have internal or elastic laminae and therefore are not able to withstand high pressure. With blood pressure in veins being relatively low, they rely somewhat on the contraction of surrounding skeletal muscle and the pumping action of the heart to boost venous return. Many medium veins contain valves, small extensions or infoldings of the tunica internal into the lumen, creating flap‐like cusps. The valves function to boost venous return by preventing backflow of blood due to gravity. Examples of medium veins are the Renal, internal carotid, ulnar, splenic, and popliteal veins (Iaizzo, 2010).
Large veins Large veins can be up to 3 cm in diameter. They have a thick tunica externa, similar to that of medium veins, but they lack valves. Large veins drain from their tributaries into the heart. Examples of the large veins are the superior vena cava, internal jugular veins, and common iliac veins (Caro, 2012).

2.3.3 Blood
A detailed approach to investigate the PPG technique and the resulting pulsating signal, by highlighting the importance of blood as the main absorber and variable during the recording has not been sufficiently investigated before. This section will address blood properties. The human body is a complex multicellular organism that comprises trillions of cells working together as tissues, organs, and systems. These cells require a continuous and unfaltering supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to function. They also need an efficient and fast means of delivery of these substances as well as a means of removing waste byproducts. This demand cannot be met by simple diffusion alone. Therefore, a more sophisticated system of supply exists in the human body (Aaronson et al., 2012). The cardiovascular system performs part of this function, transporting a specialised connective tissue, the blood, which has the following functions (Rhoades and Bell, 2012):
 Transport: It carries nutrients, oxygen, and water to the cells of the body as well as carrying away waste products and carbon dioxide. It also transports hormones to target cells throughout the body.
 Regulation: It helps regulate body temperature, pH, the ion composition of interstitial body fluids, and cell water content.
 Protection: It plays an important role in immune and inflammatory responses, protecting the body against disease and infection. It also protects the body against excessive blood loss through clotting.
2.3.3.1 Blood Components From a biological point of view, the blood can be considered a tissue composed of various types of cells (i.e. Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and a liquid intercellular material (i.e. Plasma). Figure 2-6 presents a summary of blood components and their major function.

27

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

Figure 2-6
Blood constituents. An overview of blood constituents, their concentrations and major function.
From a rheological point of view, blood can be considered a two‐phase liquid: it can also be considered as a solid‐liquid suspension with the cellular elements being the solid phase. About 40‐45% of the blood volume is occupied by the cellular elements; this volume percentage is termed haematocrit. Given the ratio 1000:60:1 for red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and White Blood Cells (WBCs), leaves RBCs 99% as the main cellular elements of blood. The plasma or the liquid phase include the macroions, electrolytes, as well, it contains 8g of protein per 100 ml. Plasma also contains fibrinogen, a soluble protein that during the clotting process, is converted to insoluble, polymerised form called fibrin. This is an important factor of the flow behaviour of blood, as this protein is responsible for the reversible aggregation of RBC, another property of the blood that will be discussed (Cokelet, 2011; Rhoades and Bell, 2012; McArdle et al., 2006). Therefore, we will focus attention on the erythrocytes, or red blood cells (RBCs) because they are the only cells which significantly influence the mechanical properties of blood due to being the main cellular element When RBCs are suspended unstressed in plasma, or isotonic fluid, RBCs are highly flexible biconcave discs with the shape and dimensions shown in Figure 2-6.

(b) Diagram of the structure of haemoglobin which consists of four polypeptide chains (two alpha and two Beta), with each containing iron bound to its heme group (McArdle et al., 2006).
2.3.3.2 Haemorheology background Biorheology deals with the flow and deformation behaviour of biofluids. In this study, the focus is around blood rheology or haemorheology. Its purpose is to study blood flow in interaction with its surrounding environment, in both macro and micro circulation.
From a rheological point of view, fluids can be divided into two main groups: Newtonian liquids; in which the viscosity is independent of variations in shear rate or shear stress and stated as a constant value, and Non‐Newtonian fluids, in which the apparent viscosity is variable but rather depends on the magnitude of the shear stress or shear rate. This viscosity of a non‐Newtonian fluid may decrease (shear thinning behaviour), or increase (shear thickening behaviour) as the shear rate is increased. The flow behaviour of such liquids may also be time‐dependent. Also, the viscosity of all liquids varies with temperature (Baskurt, 2007; How, 1996; Lipowsky, 2005).
2.3.3.3 Viscous properties of blood Deformation in rheology is defined as, the relative displacement of material points within the body. Solid reacts by deforming if the solid is elastic, the deformation is proportional to the applied force, and the original shape is spontaneously recovered when the force is removed. While fluids continuously deform, or in other means, flow due to the applied forces. Blood and some other materials exhibit viscoelastic properties, which is a combination of fluid‐like and solid‐like behaviour.
To study the degree of deformation, the force applied per unit area needs to be considered. The deforming force termed stress may have several components: Shear stress; the force per unit area acting parallel to the surface, and normal stress; the force
29

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

per unit area acting perpendicular to the surface, or the liquid pressure. The degree of deformation is termed strain. The strain also has various components; for example, shear stress results in shear strain termed shear rate, in which the layers of material move parallel to each other in a progressive manner.
The major field of interest is blood viscosity and elasticity, which is determined by plasma haematocrit, erythrocyte deformability, aggregability and orientation (How, 1996). Moreover, factors such as vessel diameter and temperature can directly affect blood viscosity.
Haematocrit Haematocrit (Hct) is the relationship between the cellular volumes as compared with the total blood volume, the normal expected values are between 40 and 45% and differ according to gender. It provides valuable information about the changes in the number and the dimensions of RBCs as well as about the volume of the blood plasma. It is found that the viscosity measured at shear rates of 10 s‐1 are strongly dependent on haematocrit, with a weaker dependence on plasma viscosity, platelets and plasma proteins (fibrinogen, albumin, and cholesterol) (Friebel et al., 2006).
Under laminar flow conditions, the presence of cellular elements disturbing the flow streamlines is the primary reason why blood viscosity is higher than plasma viscosity. The contribution of this disturbance to the magnitude of blood viscosity can be appreciated by calculating the relative viscosity of blood (i.e. blood viscosity divided by plasma viscosity). The degree of disturbance of flow streamlines and consequently the viscosity of blood is strongly dependent on the concentration of the cellular elements. As shown, there is an exponential relationship between the haematocrit value and blood viscosity, such that at higher levels of haematocrit, blood viscosity becomes increasingly sensitive to haematocrit alterations. At medium to high shear rates, there is about a 4% increase of blood viscosity per unit increase of haematocrit (Ku, 1997).
Cell Deformation Blood flows only because the RBCs are deformable, and can be reoriented to slide the low viscosity plasma. The elastic deformability of cells means that energy can be stored in and recovered from the RBCs to its original shape. It is affected by the alternations in the properties and associations of the skeletal membrane proteins, together with cell volume and cytoplasmic viscosity alternations as a result of fluid‐electrolyte imbalance (Chien et al., 1967; Cokelet, 2011; Fujii et al., 1999; How, 1996).

30

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

The primary element responsible for blood viscoelasticity is erythrocytes. Without cell deformation, calculations have shown, erythrocytes give a haematocrit of 58%. On the other hand, in the range of normal haematocrits, there is little plasma space for free cell motion without deformation (McDonald, 1960) .
Observations of the stretching of the erythrocytes and the recovery of the initial shape have been recorded. Also, their significance to the circulation has promoted many studies to assess erythrocyte deformability (Bitbol, 1986; Higgins and Fronek, 1986; Mofrad and Kamm, 2006).
Erythrocyte aggregation Another important rheological property of RBCs is their tendency to reversible aggregation (the reversible clumping of these cells under low shear forces) (Baskurt, 2007). At low shear forces, the RBCs aggregate in a special way that resembles stacks of coins, forming rouleaux, this has a considerable effect on the blood viscosity at those levels of shear. The degree of the RBC aggregation is widely accepted as a very important determinant of this behaviour is the presence of fibrinogen and other plasma proteins (Baskurt et al., 2011). Each species has its own rheological fingerprint, and the value of aggregation range from hyper aggregating in a group of animals (equine, rhinoceros), to medium type (elephants, rabbits, primates...) and to no aggregation in others (cow, sheep, camelids, rodents) (Cokelet, 2011, Windberger et al., 2003).
Erythrocyte Orientation It has been known that RBCs in a shear field can orient themselves almost parallel to the flow direction (Fischer, 2007; Fujii et al., 1999; Miller and Jones, 1993). In the presence of the tank‐treading motion of the membranes around the cell content which enables the erythrocyte to take a stable orientation. The transition threshold of the RBC from a flipping motion to a definite orientation has been demonstrated to depend on both viscosity ratio and the erythrocyte elongation. The flipping and tank‐treading motion are not the only possible influences. Higher shear rates affect RBCs orientation to be more aligned with the vorticity axis, where the cells exhibit spin without angular rotation (Cokelet, 2011; Fischer, 2007; Fujii et al., 1999).
Figure 2-8 shows a representation of the RBC deformation during the change of orientation. When RBCs exhibits unsteady tumbling‐rotating motion, the biconcave RBC rotates and flips accompanied with periodical shape deformation as seen in Figure 28(a). On the other hand, when RBC is located in a more viscous fluid, it displays a tank‐

treading movement with a stationary flattened and stretched shape as seen in Figure 28(b).

Vessel Diameter and Shear rate In a study investigating the relationship between vessel diameter and shear rate, it is mentioned that knowledge of the instantaneous volume flow rate of blood through that vessel is a must (Ercan and Koksal, 2003). This relationship varies according to the shear rate. However, a vessel’s diameter may remain fixed over time while the blood flow rate may change over time through the same vessel (Cokelet, 2011; Ercan and Koksal, 2003). The shear rate is dependent on viscosity, yet the vessel diameter is not and there is no direct relationship between shear rate and vessel diameter (Ercan and Koksal, 2003). Temperature Previous studies have suggested that increased blood temperature, results in decreased blood viscosity related to an increased blood flow rate, decreased local concentration of coagulation factors per volume per time and vasodilation effects (Cokelet, 2011; How, 1996; Valant et al., 2011). Inversely, an increase in blood viscosity due to decreased blood temperatures, higher concentrations of coagulation factors per volume per time and vasoconstriction effects (Valant et al., 2011). Also, other factors were recorded to affect blood viscosity, mental stress in relation to the Autonomic Nervous system (Reims et al.,

2005). Further investigations need to include blood flow velocity in relation to the rheological properties of the blood (Cokelet, 2011).
2.4 Cardiovascular Diseases
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. CVDs include coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). Other CVDs are a stroke, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, and venous thrombosis (Members et al., 2012).
This project is primarily focused on the investigation of Photoplethysmography for the non‐invasive assessment of factors that are altered at an early stage of cardiovascular disease. Hence, the major concern is pathologies that develop at an early stage, i.e. preclinical stages and prior to the occurrence of heart attacks or anginas. Such pathologies are atherosclerosis, hypertension, and hyperviscosity. All of these factors interact with each other to cause a positive feedback loop that drives the growth of the atherosclerotic plaque, increased arterial stiffness, microvascular resistance and overloading the heart muscle. In some cases, this process may stabilise, or sometimes accelerate. Hence, it is only plausible to study these factors together as they are part of the pathological mechanism that essentially drives the progression of cardiovascular diseases at an early stage.
2.4.1 Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis (ATH) is primarily an arterial disorder, classically characterised by lipid deposition in the vessel intima, and associated with inflammation, scarring, and calcification (Kwak et al., 2014). Eventually, these lesions cause luminal stenosis and potentially culminate in thrombotic occlusion and/or embolism. Since the manifestations of ATH –including coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, and carotid artery stenosis‐ account for a significant fraction of worldwide morbidity and mortality (Asakura and Karino, 1990; Kwak et al., 2014). The earliest visible lesion of ATH is the fatty streak, which is an accumulation of lipid‐laden macrophages in the vascular intima as seen in Figure 2-9. These lipid‐laden macrophages are often referred to as foam cells because of their foamy appearance and are believed to derive from the ingestion of lipids by macrophages within the intima .

Figure 2-9 Progression of atherosclerotic plaques.(a) the normal vessel is characterised by a lack of inflammation, non‐activated endothelium and balanced levels of circulating lipids.(B) The fatty streak develops in the context of local endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation in the intima, and recruitment of monocytes that differentiate into macrophages and the development of foam cells.(C) plaque progression shows continued accumulation of lipid, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, with the recruitment of other inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes.(D) The stable fibro‐atheromatous plaque is characterised by a fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells and relatively dense extracellular matrix.(Wang et al., 2012, pp. 461–467).
The atherosclerotic process starts early in life and proceeds silently over a long period of time before clinical manifestations. Research into the mechanisms leading to the formation of early ATH lesions is still ongoing, but clearly, a number of factors play important roles. In the current understanding of atherogenesis, the three most important factors, all interacting with each other, appear to be altered lipid metabolism, vascular cell activation, and inflammation (Wang et al., 2012).
Lipids in ATH Circulating lipids, essential for biological functions, accumulate in the tissue of the blood vessel without ever reaching the intended target cells. This accumulation is promoted by increased levels of lipids in the bloodstream, and in particular, increased levels of cholesterol (Packard and Rader, 2005). Cholesterol circulates in the blood as multiple distinct forms of lipoprotein particles. In particular, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐ associated cholesterol (so‐called bad cholesterol) promotes ATH development. In contrast, the high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) particles are so‐called the good cholesterol and promote the reverse cholesterol transport by removing cholesterol from the vessel
34

Chapter 2

wall. LDL cholesterol can thus be viewed as the fuel for the development of ATH. There is no critical threshold level of LDL that will trigger the development of ATH, and since all humans have LDL, all who live until adulthood will develop ATH to some extent (Packard and Rader, 2005). However, the degree to which the atherosclerotic lesions in any one person will progress is impacted by the concentration of LDL in the blood of that person (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001; Packard and Libby, 2008; Wang et al., 2012).
Endothelial Activation ATH results in large part from the interaction of lipoproteins with the vessel wall. Thus, changes in the cells of the vessel wall play an important role in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Activation of the endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells is a relatively general response to diverse stimuli. It is the endothelium that largely determines the specific section of an artery that will first develop ATH (Naghavi, 2010). Endothelial cells are responsive to biomechanical stimuli imparted by blood flow. Steady laminar shear stress promotes an ‘atheroprotective state’ in the endothelial cells. However, distributed blood flow that might exhibit some turbulent behaviour or high shear rates, i.e. near branch sites in the vasculature, causes endothelial changes that promote ATH (Naghavi, 2010).
Activated endothelial cells become less efficient in promoting vasodilation, and preventing platelet aggregation, and in suppressing coagulation. The shift toward such endothelial dysfunction is associated with increased reactive oxygen species production (e.g. superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and a decreased generation of nitric oxide (Shoenfeld et al., 2001).
Inflammation in ATH Inflammatory responses play important roles in the development of ATH (Packard and Libby, 2008). In ATH, there is abnormal activation of inflammatory cells, which are largely directed towards the lipid deposited in the vascular wall. In general, the greater the systemic inflammatory response, the more likely there will be vascular –associated inflammatory reactions (Shoenfeld et al., 2001). Thus, ATH is amplified by a number of chronic inflammatory conditions including periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
In ATH, the leukocytes in the circulation are recruited in the vascular wall at the sites of lipid accumulation. Initially, the leukocytes are monocytes, which are activated to form tissue macrophages. The lipid loading of these macrophages can trigger cell death that

35

contributes to more build‐up of thrombogenic material within the intima, including phospholipid and tissue factor (Naghavi, 2010; Packard and Libby, 2008).
2.4.2 Hypertension
Elevated blood pressure, also known as hypertension, affects ∼30% of the adult population in both developed and developing countries and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality (Sliwa et al., 2011). There is a positive and continuous correlation between blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and stroke, even in the normal range of blood pressures. In middle‐aged groups and the elderly, this correlation is more robust for systolic blood pressure than with diastolic blood pressure (Chobanian AV et al., 2003).
The main reasons for the development of hypertension include hereditary reasons, factors that affect the physiological control of blood pressure as described in Figure 2-1 including the cardiac output, peripheral resistance, the sympathetic nervous system, the kidneys, and homoeostasis. These factors are discussed in further depth hereunder.
2.4.2.1 Genetics of hypertension Primary hypertension clusters in families. Individuals with two or more first‐degree relatives with hypertension younger than 55 years have an almost four times greater risk of developing hypertension before 50 years of age. Family studies clearly demonstrate a significant heritability component for blood pressure (Members et al., 2012).
2.4.2.2 Cardiac output and hypertension Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Accordingly, increased the pre‐load or cardiac contractility or heart rate to neural simulations are important. Patients with established hypertension usually have a lower blood volume and total exchangeable sodium when compared to normotensive individuals. This was attributed to increased translocation of fluid across the capillary bed into the interstitial space and possibly to increased intracellular fluid volume. Increased heart rates have been attributed to increased sympathetic activity and/or decreased parasympathetic activity (Safar et al., 2014).
2.4.2.3 The sympathetic nervous system and hypertension Increased sympathetic activity plays a major role in hypertension, particularly in the early stages (Tank et al., 2003). This is evidenced by elevated plasma norepinephrine levels, increased heart rate and blood pressure variability, increased alpha‐adregnic vasoconstriction and increased vascular reactivity to norepinephrine. Changes in other

36

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

neurotransmitters (e.g. adenosine and dopamine) may also reflect sympathetic nervous system involvement (Reims et al., 2004).
2.4.2.4 Renal function and hypertension The link between abnormal renal function and hypertension has been long established. The kidney increases urinary sodium excretion in response to elevated blood pressure, and reduce blood volume and normalise blood pressure. It has been suggested that a reduction in the filtration surface in the kidney (due to reduced number or efficiency of nephrons) may limit renal sodium excretion. Also, excess dietary salt intake induces hypertension by increasing fluid volume and cardiac output. Sodium excess may also increase blood pressure by influencing vascular reactivity and tone (Courneya and M.D, 2010; Rhoades and Bell, 2012).
2.4.2.5 The vascular system and hypertension Small arteries are responsible for blood pressure control and regional distribution of blood flow through effects on vascular resistance. According to Poiseuille law, a slight change in lumen size results in significant changes in resistance. The lumen diameter of resistance arteries is a function of vasomotor tone via the vasoconstriction and vasodilation processes and the mechanical properties of the vessel wall (Safar et al., 2014).
Vascular contraction Vascular smooth muscle cell contraction is a major factor regulating the vascular tone. It is increased in experimental and clinical hypertension. Non‐invasive diagnostic approaches including vascular ultrasound, pulse wave analysis and peripheral tone studying the endothelial function and human vascular tone have demonstrated that patients with hypertension exhibit impaired endothelium‐dependant vasodilation, increased vascular reactivity, and increased contractility (Barac et al., 2007).The vascular contraction is primarily regulated by the increased levels of calcium ions (Baker, 2000).
Vascular ageing and hypertension Age‐associated changes in blood vessels are known to occur in healthy individuals (Mancia et al., 2007). These changes include increased arterial wall thickness, reduced compliance, increased stiffness, and decreased lumen diameter. All of these features cause the increase in flow resistance and hence, overloading the workload on the heart, and hence they are commonly associated with hypertension. The structural changes are also related to the endothelial dysfunction, caused by the change in the chemical content of the vessel wall. Arterial ageing is a predominant risk factor for the occurrence of CVDs,

37

Chapter 2

such as hypertension, and is associated with increased vascular stiffness, intima‐media thickening, calcification, and inflammation (Mancia et al., 2007).
2.4.2.6 Other factors Other factors include the Renin‐Angiotensin system which can be described as a haemodynamic regulator the increases blood pressure temporarily by vasoconstriction and chronically through aldosterone‐mediated volume expansion. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress also play a role in hypertension. Reactive oxygen species are signalling molecules important in the regulation of many physiological processes including defence, ageing, and cellular hemostasis.
2.4.3 Hyperviscosity
We have previously defined blood viscosity and the associated rheological properties of RBCs. Patients with acute and chronic CVDs may have abnormalities involving blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, red cell deformability, red cell aggregation and fibrinogen (Cho et al., 2014; Coull et al., 1991; Dintenfass, 1964). Medically, it is possible to find abundant evidence throughout the literature that blood viscosity can be a significant indicator of cardiovascular diseases at an early stage. A strong link has been reported in thrombosis (Dintenfass, 1964), hypertension (Letcher et al., 1983; Pop et al., 2002), myocardial infarction (Jan et al., 1975; Turczyński et al., 2002), cardiovascular complications (Cho et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 1997) and acute stroke(Coull et al., 1991; Gusev et al., 2008). Hyperviscosity is also linked with CVD risk factors such as increased cholesterol levels (Crowley et al., 1994), diabetes (Irace et al., 2013), obesity (Safar et al., 2006) and tobacco exposure (Shimada et al., 2011).

2.5 The Physics of Blood Flow
It is essential to develop an understanding of the physical factors and laws that govern the movement of blood in the cardiovascular system for an overall understanding of its function. This section is dedicated to cover some of the most relevant concepts related to cardiac fluid mechanics. For simplification purposes, we will represent flow movement in a cylindrical vascular model as seen in Figure 2-10.

Figure 2-10 Pressure and tension in a cylindrical blood vessel. The tension is the force that would pull the vessel apart along line along the length of the vessel. Tension in the vessel wall is related to the law of Laplace. P, pressure, tension(Rhoades and Bell, 2012) .

The volume contained in arteries and veins is a function of the pressure difference across their wall, called the transmural pressure, and the degree of stiffness within the vascular wall. Transmural pressure (PT) is defined as the difference in pressure inside versus the outside of a hollow structure cylinder (Caro, 2012; Rhoades and Bell, 2012). The change in volume (V) for a given change in transmural pressure is called the compliance (C); which is defined as the property of a material undergoing elastic deformation or change in volume when subjected to an applied force. It is equal to the reciprocal of stiffness and is given by the equation

C  V / PT

(2.1)

Where  signifies the before/after a change of volume or pressure. The outside pressure is taken to be atmospheric pressure, which is always given at the baseline value of zero in normal physiologic systems. As will be highlighted later, vascular compliance and stiffness are critical determinants of the performance of the heart, workload placed on the heart, and the amount of oxygen consumption for normal functionality.

39

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

It is important to note that arterial compliance or stiffness are not constants within the cardiovascular system (e.g. as P increases, C decreases). Moreover, arterial compliance decreases with age at any given transmural pressure as seen in Figure 2-11 and is reduced by contraction of the smooth muscle within arteries or veins. This is an important component of haemostasis control in individuals.

Figure 2-11 The relationship between volume and transmural pressure in arteries and the effect of age on the relationship (Rhoades and Bell, 2012).
Any transmural pressure within an artery or vein exerts distributed forces on the inner surface of the vessel wall as illustrated in Figure 2-10. Such forces are balanced with the opposing forces supplied by the muscle and connective tissue of the vessel wall, termed as Tension (T). For cylinders with thin walls in comparison to the tube radius (commonly agreed ratio of 10‐20), tension is represented with Law of Laplace which relates the vessel
radius (r) with PT through the relationshipT  PT .r (Rhoades and Bell, 2012). However,
such conditions do not apply to most blood vessels, the walls of arteries and veins are sufficiently thick, and in reality, tension is proportional to wall stress (S) and is expressed
with the relationship S  PT .r / w , where w is the wall thickness. Tension and stress are
important determinants of energy requirements of the contraction of blood vessels, as they need to be overcome for the vessels to contract.
2.5.1 Reynolds’ Observations: Laminar and Turbulent flow
After the middle of the 19th century, collected experimental data revealed that in a liquid flowing at a slow rate, the pressure drop is proportional to the speed of flow. Under these
40

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

conditions, it has been observed that the liquid parts move smoothly adjacent to the parallel tube wall, known as Laminar flow. In the case of increasing flow rates, there is a tendency for the liquid flow to become irregular, as the fluid move in swirls and random patterns. This type of chaotic flow is termed Turbulent.

Reynolds found (King, 1916) that the onset of turbulence depends on the average flow velocity through the tube Reynolds number was introduced as a dimensionless quantity to help predict similar flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. It is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and is represented by the following equation:

Re  vL  vL



(2.2)

Where v is the maximum velocity of the fluid in m/s, L is the characteristic linear dimension, for a flow in a pipe, L is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (N s/m2 or kg/(m.s)),  is the density of the fluid (kg/m3) and  is the kinematic viscosity (m2/s).

The typical Reynolds number range of blood flow in the body varies from 1 in small arterioles to approximately 4000 in the largest artery, the aorta. Thus, the flow spans a range in which viscous forces are dominant on one end, and inertial forces are more important on the other.

2.5.2 Poiseuille Law
In the 1840s, Louis Poiseuille conducted experiments that resulted in a mathematical relationship that describes flow in a cylindrical tube (Ku, 1997; McDonald, 1960). This is known as Poiseuille law and states that:

Q   r4P / 8l

(2.3)

Where Q is the flow, P is the pressure difference between a point at the entrance of the tube and the end, l is the tube length and  is fluid viscosity. The term 8l /  r4 is the resistance (R) to the flow and in physiology is expressed in mmHg/ml and is known as peripheral resistance. Hence in the cardiovascular system, this relationship can be rewritten as

P  Q.R

(2.4)

This relationship indicates that flow is proportional to the pressure difference between the entrance and the exit points of the tube and inversely proportional to the resistance

41

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

of the cardiovascular system, ‘’the end of the tube’’ is considered the right atrium where the pressure is known to be about 2 mmHg. This is usually eliminated from the equation, so the difference in the pressure becomes simply P, as is taken as the mean pressure within an artery or vein. Consequently, the Poiseuille law reduces to

P  Q.R

(2.5)

This law indicates that the mean pressure is the product of the flow output of the heart, called cardiac output, and the resistance to flow provided by all blood vessel and blood viscosity is total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR).

2.5.2.1 The applicability of Poiseuille equation to the circulation The conditions under which the Poiseuille’s equation applies should be considered in more details (McDonald, 1960):

1. The fluid is homogenous, and its viscosity is the same at all rates of shear: Blood is a non‐Newtonian fluid. However, it has been assumed that in tubes with large internal diameter compared with the size of the erythrocytes, blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid.
2. The liquid does not slip at the wall. This was the assumption that velocity is zero in fluid layers adjacent to the wall. This theory is held to be universally true for liquids.
3. The flow is laminar, and the liquid is at all points moving parallel to the walls of the tube. Turbulence might occur in the largest blood vessels, but the laminar flow is expected to be present in all the vessels.
4. The rate of flow is steady, where the flow is not subject to deceleration or acceleration. If the velocity is altered, the pressure gradient is partly utilised in communicating kinetic energy to the liquid. Blood flow is markedly pulsatile, and Poiseuille laws do not apply.
5. The tube is long compared with the region being studied. Near the inlet of the tube, flow is not yet developed into the parabolic velocity profile of laminar flow. In the circulation, there is never the condition of a stationary reservoir leading to steady laminar flow.
6. The tube is rigid, and the diameter does not vary with the internal pressure. Blood vessels are viscoelastic structures, and their diameter is a function of transmural pressure. However, Baez et al. demonstrated that the diameter of capillaries varied very little with changes in the internal pressure in the range of 20‐100

42

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

mmHg. Similar observations led Fung et al. to postulate that the extracellular fluid has a gel‐like structure that effectively strengthens the wall(Fung et al., 1966).

The assumptions underlying the Poiseuille equation discussed above can be only be applied approximately in living circulation. Such assumptions can compensate the reality of the pulsatile flow in the circulation and the role of wall elasticity, fluid viscosity and the most basic phenomena that are essential to describe blood pulsatile flow. A more comprehensive and inclusive mathematical approach is the Navier‐stokes equation discussed below.

2.5.3 Navier‐Stokes Equations in Tubes
The Navier‐Stokes equations are the basic governing equations for a viscous, heat conducting fluid. The initial work was conducted by Navier in 1827. However, this was not completely successful and was later developed by Poisson in 1831. Both of which relied on assumptions of intramolecular forces that are now considered unrealistic. Stoke reworked the entire problem in 1845, and the resulting equations are known as Navier‐ Stoke equations. It is a vector equation obtained by applying Newton's Law of motion to a fluid element and is also called the momentum equation. It is supplemented by the mass conservation equation, also called continuity equation and the energy equation. Usually, the term Navier‐Stokes equations are used to refer to all of this equation (Zamir, 2000).

By applying Navier‐Stokes equations to cylindrical coordinates and when the tube wall is nonrigid, there presents radial velocity (u), and both axial and radial velocities are dependent on the displacement (x) even away from the tube entrance. Using Navier‐ Stokes equations, and assuming only axial symmetry leads to,

Where  is density, u is axial velocity, v is radial velocity, t is time, and r is tube radius. An input oscillatory pressure propagates down the tube, and there is wave motion within the tube, where, the pressure gradient and the two velocities are functions of both x and t. u and v are functions of x.

43

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

While in a rigid tube, it is possible to postulate a fully developed region away from the tube entrance where the flow is independent of x. Thus, derivatives of u, v with respect to x are zero. The equation of continuity combined with the boundary condition v=0 at the tube wall then leads to v being identically zero and the governing equations reduce to

u p 2u 1 u

   (  )

t x r 2 r r

(2.8)

Where the pressure gradient is a function of t only, not of x and the velocity u is then a function or r and t only, not of x. For an oscillatory pressure gradient, the velocity u then oscillates with the same frequency, and since it is not a function of x, it will represent the velocity at every cross section of the tube. The fluid is expected to oscillate in bulk, and no wave motion is expected to be present when the tube is rigid. An illustration representing the flow profiles in a rigid (top) and an elastic tube (bottom) are presented in Figure 2-12.

The speed of which the wave propagates down the tube depends on the elasticity of the tube wall. If the wall thickness is small compared to the tube radius, and if the effects of viscosity can be neglected, the wave speed is given approximately by the Moen‐Korteweg formula (Zamir, 2000, p. 115).

Eh

PWV 

d

(2.9)

The Moens–Korteweg equation states that pulse wave velocity (PWV) is proportional to the square root of the incremental elastic modulus, (E), of the vessel wall given constant ratio of wall thickness, h, to vessel diameter, d, and blood density, ρ, assuming that the artery wall is isotropic and experiences isovolumetric change with pulse pressure.

Applying Navier‐stoke equations to blood flow in arteries usually requires making some assumption to simplify the equations. The equations are non‐linear partial differential equations that require powerful computers to provide a solution. One of the simplified dimensional analysis of the equations is Womersley number.

2.5.4 Womersley Number
A dimensional analysis of the unsteady Navier‐Stokes equations leads to a non‐ dimensional number commonly referred to as the Womersley or Witzig parameter:

44

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

The Womersley number (α) is a dimensionless expression of the pulsatile flow frequency in relation to viscous effects. It is named after John R. Womersley (1907–1958) for his work with blood flow in arteries and is represented by the following relationship:

α2=ρωr2/μ

(2.10)

where r is the tube radius, ω is the angular frequency, and μ is the kinematic viscosity (Womersley, 1955). This parameter is used in the similarity transform developed in the well‐known Stokes' Second Problem, in which flow is induced by an oscillating flat plate.

The Womersley parameter α can be interpreted as the ratio of the unsteady forces to the viscous forces. When the Womersley parameter is low, viscous forces dominate, velocity profiles are parabolic in shape, and the centerline velocity oscillates in phase with the driving pressure gradient (McDonald, 1960; Womersley, 1955). For Womersley parameters above 10, the unsteady inertial forces dominate, and the flow is essentially one of piston‐like motion with a flat velocity profile. The amplitude of motion decreases at the higher frequencies, and there is a 90° phase difference between the pressure gradient and flow, as in a low‐pass filter.

In contrast to unsteadiness, several features of biological flows tend to be neglected in some situations as secondary in importance. These properties include vessel wall elasticity, non‐Newtonian viscosity, slurry particles in the fluid, body forces, and temperature. Although each is physiologically relevant, the analysis is greatly simplified when these can be justifiably neglected.

2.5.5 Velocity Profiles
Vascular biologists are currently more concerned with the local haemodynamic conditions in a given artery or branch than simply the flow waveform. A detailed local description of these pulsatile flows is needed. The fluid‐wall shear stress in a blood vessel for a given pulsatile flow situation often needs to be determined. Fully developed pulsatile flow in a straight or tapered tube can be expressed analytically (Hale et al., 1955; Womersley, 1955). A physiologic pressure or flow waveform can be expanded as a Fourier series, and the harmonic components of velocity can be summed to yield the unsteady velocity profiles. Figure 2-12 shows an example of velocity profiles for pulsatile flow in a rigid and non‐rigid tube wall.

45

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

Figure 2-12 Pulsatile flow in a rigid wall (top) and in a nonrigid wall (bottom) (Zamir, 2000).
The Womersley solution for velocity can be used to generate excellent approximations for shear stress as long as secondary and separated flows are not present. Analytical solutions have also been obtained for flow through arteries that translate or change their radius of curvature, such as coronary arteries, which ride on the moving heart surface (Delfino et al., 1994).
2.5.6 Entrance Regions
Flow from the heart comes from a large pressure reservoir into successively smaller tubes. The flow is not fully developed near some of the origins of arteries. Flow in these regions is similar to an entrance flow with a potential core and a developing boundary layer at the wall. The velocity profiles are blunt near the centre, and the centerline velocity accelerates as the boundary layer retards velocity near the wall (Zamir, 2000).
Unsteady flow through the entrance region depends on the Womersley parameter as well as the Reynolds number. For low Womersley parameters, the maximum unsteady entrance length is approximately the same as the steady entrance length for the peak flow and is primarily dependent on the Reynolds number. For high Womersley parameters, the Stokes boundary layer growth is faster, and the entrance length is more uniform
46

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

during the cycle. For α ≥ 12.5, the pulsatile entrance length is approximately the same length as the entrance length of the mean flow. At all α, the wall shear rate converges to its fully developed value at about half the length at which the centerline velocity converges to its fully developed value. Thus, the upstream flow conditions leading to a specific artery may or may not be fully developed and can be predicted by the magnitudes of the Reynolds number and Womersley parameter (He and Ku, 1994)
Although a Womersley‐type analysis is useful to gain a general understanding of the relevant forces, the nonlinear convective term is important to many flows at arterial branches. Likewise, the flow in most arteries is subject to viscous forces that cannot be neglected. For a medium‐sized artery, the Reynolds number is typically on the order of 100 to 1000, and the Womersley parameter ranges from 1 to 10 (Caro, 2012). These conditions allow for few simplifications of the unsteady Navier‐Stokes equations. Arteries have a high degree of stiffness that does allow for a long wavelength approximation. In most cases, the effects of elasticity are considered to be very small, and analytics are based on an assumption of rigid tube flow. Most studies of artery haemodynamics use experimental measurements, potential flow theory, or computational fluid mechanics. The three‐dimensional (3D) nature of many of these unsteady flows is a serious obstacle to computational methods because the computational time required is enormous.
2.5.7 Fluid Viscosity
On the molecular level, fluids exert forces of attraction on each other. When the fluid flows over a surface, the layer adjacent to the surface may become attached to it, where the rest of the layers are moving. Therefore, a shearing force takes place between the layers of the fluid. Shear stress is the force applied to a layer of fluid to cause it to slide past other layers. The rate of shear is the velocity gradient between 2 parallel planes in a flowing liquid that occurs as a result of the force (Feireisl, 2003). The viscosity of a fluid is defined as a ratio of shear stress to the rate of shear. The unit of viscosity in the metric system is the Poise, named after Jean Poiseuille. Generally, the poise is expressed in CGS (centimeter‐gram‐second). In the MKS system, poise is replaced with the Pascal.second (Pa.s).
For most fluids, such as plasma or serum, the viscosity of a liquid is an inherent property of the liquid itself. The measured viscosity is the same regardless of the shear rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian fluids; Newtonian fluids are generally homogeneous.

47

Chapter 2

Basic Principles and Physiology of Blood Circulation

On the other hand, fluids that change viscosity in accordance with varying shear rates are called non‐Newtonian fluids. Many mathematical models are available to describe the nonlinear ‘’shear stress versus deformation‐rate’’ relationship of non‐Newtonian fluids (Waite and AccessEngineering, 2007). But no general model can describe the constitutive equation of all kind of non‐Newtonian fluids. However, the mathematical model for describing the mechanistic behaviour of a variety of commonly used non‐ Newtonian fluids is the Power‐Law model which is also known as Ostwald‐de Waele model where

  K (u y)n

Where

K

is

the flow

consistency index,

u y

is

the shear rate or

velocity gradient perpendicular to the plane of shear in s‐ 1, and n is a dimensionless

parameter termed the flow behaviour index.

Power‐law fluid can be subdivided into three different types of fluids based on the value of their flow behaviour index; where n=1 is a pseudoplastic fluid, n=1 is a Newtonian fluid and at n>1 is a dilatant fluid.

Pseudoplastic or shear‐thinning fluids have a lower apparent viscosity at higher shear rates and are usually solutions of large, polymeric molecules in a solvent with smaller molecules (Viswanath et al., 2007). It is generally supposed that the large molecular chains tumble at random and affect large volumes of fluid under low shear, but that they gradually align themselves in the direction of increasing shear and produce less resistance. Dilatant or shear‐thickening fluids increase in apparent viscosity at higher shear rates. They are rarely encountered.

Whole blood behaves as a non‐Newtonian fluid. This property is related to the behaviour of the erythrocytes and their known viscoelastic properties that were discussed earlier. Even that such factors can be heavily affected by chemical content, they are reflected in the mechanical behaviour of red blood cells and of blood as a whole. Studies have shown that blood behaves like observed in Figure 2-13 under varying shear rates. The factors affecting whole blood viscosity have been discussed earlier in this chapter.

3.1 Introduction
Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from infancy to old age globally. It is estimated that 90% of CVD is preventable (McGill et al., 2008). CVDs are associated with many risk factors. These include hereditary reasons that cannot be influenced and other risk factors that can be treated or controlled. These include hypertension, tobacco exposure, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, unhealthy diets and harmful use of alcohol. These are useful predictors of morbid atherosclerosis and hypertensive events, and their control variably reduces the incidence of morbid events.
National health policy panels have recommended active treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia when clinical measurements of blood pressure and cholesterol fall outside the predefined normal limits (Chobanian AV et al., 2003; Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001). Yet

epidemiologic data indicate that most cardiovascular events occur among individuals with moderate levels of risk factors (Hulley et al., 1992). Therefore, there is a need for more accurate early‐stage monitoring/screening where preclinical parameters that can predict future morbid events in patients, especially those with asymptomatic CVD can be readily available using noninvasive technologies.
This project will focus on the three major determinants of cardiovascular health at an early stage: blood pressure (BP), arterial stiffness (AS) and blood viscosity (BV).Our interest in those three parameters stems from their importance in the cardiovascular circulation and the amount of literature that reports on hypertension, increased arterial stiffness and hyperviscosity as major risk factors at the very early stages of preclinical and asymptomatic CVD and their role in the progression of atherosclerosis to more complex stages and the development of strokes (Coull et al., 1991; Hansen et al., 2006), anginas (Taniguchi et al., 2014; Yoneda et al., 1989), and heart attacks (Hirai et al., 1989; Jan et al., 1975; Turczyński et al., 2002). Hence, they can be considered, as the source of the progression and development of cardiovascular diseases.
In this chapter, we present an overview of the most commonly used invasive and non‐ invasive methods for measurement or estimation of BP, AS, and BV whether commercially available for clinical assessments and personal devices or methods that are being investigated by researchers.
3.2 Blood Pressure Measurements
Arterial blood pressure is a key measurement of haemodynamic status and is a marker of adequate organ perfusion and tissue flow. The monitoring of blood pressure is one of the minimal mandatory standards required in anaesthetic practice. The accurate measurement of a patient’s arterial blood pressure is vital as it enables clinicians to deliver safe and appropriate care. Currently available methods for blood pressure measurements include continuous invasive methods and non‐invasive intermittent and continuous methods and are discussed in this section (Marini and Wheeler, 2012).
3.2.1 Invasive Continuous Methods
The direct measurement of arterial pressure uses an indwelling cannula and is considered to be the most accurate, real‐time method of monitoring blood pressure. An intra‐arterial cannula is hydraulically coupled via a column of saline to a diaphragm and transducer assembly (Chung et al., 2013). The transducer is usually a bonded wire strain gauge. Changes in pressure produce very small movements of the diaphragm that in turn alters

51

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

the length of the strain gauge wire and its electrical resistance. The strain gauge is incorporated into the four‐resistor arrangement of a Wheatstone bridge containing a null deflection galvanometer (Chung et al., 2013). The changes in electrical resistance mirror the changes in arterial pressure. The arterial pressure waveform is a periodic complex wave which may be considered to be the sum of a series of overlapping sine waves of different frequencies, amplitudes, and phase relationships. Using Fourier analysis, the waveform is converted into its sine wave components. The fundamental frequency (f) is the most basic sine wave component and is equal to the heart rate (1‐2 Hz). Subsequent harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency (2f, 3f, 4f.). As the harmonics increase, their amplitude decreases. Thus, higher order harmonics contribute least to the shape of the arterial pressure wave, and the pressure wave can be reliably reconstructed from the first ten harmonics (Marini and Wheeler, 2012).
This method incurs some disadvantages that can be summarised as:
 The invasive nature of this method makes it less appealing for regular or fast assessments.
 A non‐feasible method for personal devices and home healthcare.  There are two sources of error in this method: resonance, which can be avoided
using wide tubes and less dense fluid, and damping, which emerges from bubbles and clots in the system.  It requires experienced staff to connect the device and provide the readings.
3.2.2 Non‐invasive Intermittent Methods 3.2.2.1 Manometry
A pneumatic cuff connected to a liquid filled manometer is inflated, occluding the arterial flow to a limb and then deflated. The pressure measured is the height of the fluid column when the pulse returns distally to the cuff. It is detected by digital palpation or auscultation for Korotkoff sounds. The cuff may be used on the upper arm, forearm or leg and the width should be 40% of the mid‐circumference of the limb, covering two‐ thirds of the limb length. Aneroid gauges or electronic pressure transducers are now more commonly used (Marini and Wheeler, 2012).
3.2.2.2 Oscillometry Devices employing oscillometric principles include the DINAMP (Device for non‐ INvasive Automatic Mean Arterial Pressure). These devices allow automatic hands‐free blood pressure measurement at a user defined frequency (Chung et al., 2013). They are

52

designed to be more user‐friendly and come in different sizes and configurations (See Figure 3-1).
A pneumatic cuff occludes the arterial flow which is then deflated automatically at different steps coupled with the patient’s heart rate. As the arterial flow returns, the vessel wall vibrates causing variations in cuff pressure, which are sensed by a pressure transducer. The signal is digitised and a microprocessor presents a numerical display. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the point of maximal oscillations and the most accurate measurement. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are calculated as the fastest rate of increase and decrease in oscillation amplitude respectively).

Figure 3-1 Oscillometry manometer (Grahamfield, 2016).
Early oscillon tonometers (Von Recklinghausen, 1931) used two cuffs. The proximal cuff with adjustable bleed valve occludes arterial flow. The distal cuff senses when pulsations return by means of two aneroid chambers which are connected to a dial via a mechanical linkage. A rotating valve determines interconnections between the cuffs, inflating mechanism, bleed valves, and aneroids (Marini and Wheeler, 2012). Non‐invasive intermittent methods are simple to use and require minimal training however inaccuracies may arise from:
 Inappropriate cuff size can cause misreadings; a small cuff can cause over readings and under‐reading with a large cuff
 Limb movement  External compression  Hypotension  Arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation)  The cuff may cause tissue or nerve damage and patient discomfort
53

 The delay between readings is the major drawback with intermittent techniques and can be overcome by using continuous monitoring devices.
3.2.3 Non‐invasive Continuous Methods 3.2.3.1 Ultrasound
Doppler ultrasound measures change in blood velocity in the large arteries. Velocity profiles and distension waveforms may be measured using a brightness mode (B‐mode or 2D mode) ultrasound device; allowing local Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) to be estimated mathematically (Beulen et al., 2011). The PWV values are then used to convert distension waveforms to pressure waveforms with good correlation to reference pressure traces.
The main drawbacks of this method are:
 It requires extreme precision to the placement and securing of the ultrasound transducer directly over the artery. Dislocation of the transducer from the arterial site leads to sudden loss of information which might cause confusion for the operator if the loss of information is due to an emergency or the dislocation of the sensor.
 The ultrasound technique is not suitable for measurement of diastolic BP.  The method is not practical for personal use or home healthcare devices and has
limitations for providing the desired continuous, reliable readings of blood pressure.
3.2.3.2 Applanation tonometry Tonometry is widely used in ophthalmology for measuring intraocular pressure and for the assessment of glaucoma and its response to treatment. The method was first applied to the determination of arterial pressure waves by Pressman and Newgard in 1963 (Pressman and Newgard, 1963). A pressure transducer is applied directly over and partially flattens the radial artery or other sites. The resultant waveform is used to calculate systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures. An algorithm allows the calculation of pressure values such as central systolic pressure, pulse wave velocity and ejection time.
Requirements for effective applanation of the arterial wall by a tonometry sensor include:
 The artery at the measurement site runs shallow beneath the skin and is fixed on a hard tissue such as a bone.

54

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

 The sensor is always smaller than the applanted area of the arterial wall along the cardiac cycle.
 The sensor’s position is exactly fixed and is not affected by physical motion during the measurement.
Difficulties associated with the method include:
 Under optimal conditions for applantation, the pressure wave measured non‐ invasively is virtually identical to that recorded with a high fidelity transducer with the artery (Kelly et al. 1989, Somer and Meiselman, 1993). In practice, the pressure required to applanate the artery and compress the overlying structure does vary, so that the absolute values of systolic and diastolic pressure cannot be determined reliably. The signal is very position‐sensitive, and the transducer needs to be situated directly in the centre of the artery.
 The carotid artery has an additional difficulty, which is movement in the surrounding tissues due to respiration.
 The probe can cause mechanical stimulation of the baroreceptor which might induce BP fluctuations during the measurement.
 The theory only applies when a small part of the arterial wall is flattened. This, of course, will not apply if the sensor is not applied directly over the artery, neither if a large sensor is applied over the artery and adjoining structures. Most sensors need to be calibrated against an intra‐arterial pressure to confirm accuracy.
 With radial tonometry, strict adherence to standard processes is necessary to ensure that clinically sound data are obtained. This method requires trained staff to acquire reliable measurements and hence, the method is not feasible for personal healthcare devices.
3.2.3.3 Photoplethysmography: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique commonly known to detect changes in blood volume from skin surfaces. The technique will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 as it is the main focus of this project.
The PPG has been utilised for blood pressure measurements in two methods: the vascular unloading method and the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) method or Pulse Transit Time (PTT).

Figure 3-2 Demonstration of the non‐invasive beat‐to‐beat blood measurement system, CNAP monitor 500 as obtained from the manufacturer.
The vascular unloading technique uses Infrared (IR) transmission PPG to provide ‘raw’ continuous pressure readings in commercial devices such as the Finapres (Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Netherlands), the CNAP (cnsystems, US) (seen in Figure 3-2), and Nexfin (ClearSight System, Edwards Lifesciences, US). Finger‐IR PPG detects changes in blood volume and is used in conjunction with a finger cuff and servo‐controlled pump which adjusts cuff pressure to maintain a constant finger blood volume. The Finapres considers that the cuff pressure needed to maintain light intensity equals the arterial blood pressure. However, this assumption might encounter inaccuracies due to: (1) The effective cuff pressure may not equal the cuff pressure due to the lack of uniform distribution of cuff pressure. (2) The cuff pressure at which the maximum amplitude of variation in transmitted light is observed may not equal the mean arterial pressure. (3) The Finapres assumes that the only blood under the cuff is in the artery. However, blood continues to pass through the artery during the measurement, leading to an increase in blood volume in the capillaries at the end of the finger (Chung et al., 2013). Consequently, the pressure there begins to rise and venous pressure will become comparable with arterial pressure, at which point blood will flow back along the vein. The implications of this flow on the Finapres readings are not well understood (Nm et al., 1991; Stokes et al., 1991). The CNAP overcomes this by alternating the readings between two nearby finger cuffs and provide comparable accuracy to invasive intra‐arterial pressure measurements in normotensive conditions (Jeleazcov et al., 2010), however, the device is less accurate

during hypotension events or at alternating vascular tone (Ilies et al., 2012). Other limitations include the potential for patient discomfort due to the need for repeated calibration with the brachial artery pressure using an oscillometric cuff. The Nexfin monitor uses similar vascular unloading techniques to produce a brachial arterial pressure waveform. The Nexfin can reliably detect changes in arterial pressure, however, reduced precision during periods of haemodynamic instability makes it an unsuitable alternative to direct pressure monitoring (Weiss et al., 2014). Moreover, the three available commercial devices come with a high price tag and are not well suited for personal or home use.
Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) is the speed of a pressure pulse propagating along the arterial wall and can be calculated from pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is the time between two pulse waves propagating on the same cardiac cycle from two arterial sites (Gesche et al., 2012). This method has been investigated using a combination of ECG and PPG signals (Ahlstrom et al., 2005; Foo and Lim, 2006, 2006). While few studies consider the method to be reliable (Ahlstrom et al., 2005; Gesche et al., 2012), some question the reliability of this approach as a clinical device (Jerrard‐Dunne et al., 2008; Payne et al., 2006). Investigation in a large number of subjects showed that age, BP, gender and cardiovascular risk factors significantly influence PWV (Foo and Lim, 2006; Yamashina et al., 2002). Studies suggest that PWV can only be used for measurement of relative BP changes and may encounter errors due to the effect of BP on the measurement and the variability of arterial elasticity from one individual to another or due to neurohormonal factors.
3.3 Assessment of arterial stiffness
The stiffness of large arteries has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, especially in hypertensive subjects. More specifically, aortic stiffness has been shown to be a predictor of primary coronary events (Mattace‐Raso et al., 2006) and of fatal stroke (Laurent et al., 2003) in hypertensive patients. Arterial stiffness (AS) was also reported as an independent risk factor for recurrent acute coronary events in patients with ischemic heart disease (Stefanadis et al., 2000) or a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end‐stage renal disease (Blacher et al., 1999). Type‐2 diabetes has also been shown to be associated with increased stiffness (Catalano et al., 2013), which is believed to be a major cause of the increased general cardiovascular risk related to diabetes (Alvim et al., 2013). Moreover, AS has also been associated with risk factors of CVDs, such as obesity (Safar et al., 2006). In all these cases, knowledge of

57

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

arterial stiffness represents a valuable indicator for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy assessment of patients.
Measuring arterial stiffness has been recommended as an additional test for hypertension management in a Task Force study appointed by the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology (Members et al., 2013). The underlying reason for the correlation between arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk is commonly related to changes in the cardiac work resulting from arterial stiffening, leading eventually to cardiac hypertrophy, alteration of perfusion and of metabolic demand, and increased systolic dysfunction (Gatzka et al., 1998; Kass et al., 1996)
Reliable methods capable of estimating arterial stiffness represent therefore significant clinical interest. In this section, we present an overview of the currently available methods for the assessment of arterial stiffness.
3.3.1 Arterial Stiffness Terminology
There are different methods of assessing arterial stiffness, some of which are more widely applicable in the clinical setting than others. Several techniques give information on systemic arterial stiffness while others only give information on local stiffness of the vessel being studied. Terms used in the field of arterial stiffness are often used interchangeably when in fact they have slightly different meanings. In simple terms, arterial stiffness describes the rigidity of the arterial walls. Other terms used to describe the properties of vessel walls are defined in Table 3-1.

3.3.2 Pulse Pressure for Estimation of AS

Pulse pressure can be measured using a standard sphygmomanometer. It is one of the

simplest measures of arterial stiffness, and easily practicable in the clinical setting

(Nichols and M.D, 2011). The pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and

diastolic pressures and depends on the cardiac output, large‐artery stiffness and wave

reflection. In 1922, Bramwell and Hill identified that pulse pressure as a good indicator of arterial stiffness (Bramwell and Hill, 1922). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures tend to increase with age (Franklin et al., 1997). However, beyond the age of 50–60 years, there is no further increase in diastolic blood pressure and, in many cases, it actually declines. Figure 3-3 shows the change in systolic and diastolic pressure values with age. However, some oscillometric sphygmomanometers may be unreliable in older subjects (Popele et al., 2000). Moreover, pulse pressure alone is inadequate to assess arterial stiffness accurately. Problems include the ‘normal’ amplification of the pressure wave as it travels from the aorta to the periphery, although this effect becomes less pronounced with increasing age. Thus, measurements of pulse pressure made in the periphery, for example in the upper arm, do not always accurately reflect the actual central pulse pressure (Pauca et al., 1992).
Indeed, there can be differences of up to 20 mmHg between central pressures of patients with identical brachial blood pressure readings. Interestingly, exaggerated amplification is thought to account for the phenomenon of pseudo‐hypertension in the young (O’Rourke et al., 2000).
Central pressure may, therefore, be a more accurate predictor of risk than peripheral blood pressure. Moreover, it is the central pressure that contributes most to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, itself an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, and changes in left ventricular geometry (Boutouyrie et al., 1999). Also, carotid intimal medial thickness, a marker of cardiovascular risk (Matsushima et al., 2004; Zureik et al., 2002) is dependent on carotid but not brachial pulse pressure.

3.3.3 Pulse Wave Velocity for AS Estimation
Pulse wave velocity is the speed at which the forward pressure wave is transmitted from the aorta through the vascular tree. It is calculated by measuring the time taken for the arterial waveform to pass between two points a measured distance apart, and involves taking readings from the two sites simultaneously, or gating separate recordings to a fixed point in the cardiac cycle (e.g. the R‐wave of the ECG, the PPG signal, pressure or flow signals, or a combination of both). Various different methods have been used, both invasive and non‐invasive, and can be applied to either flow or pressure waves (Naidu et al., 2005; Padilla et al., 2006; Sutton‐Tyrrell et al., 2005). The important point is the reference point on the waveforms. Indeed, the foot‐to‐foot methodology is usually used, as it avoids the confounding influence of wave reflection (Hermeling et al., 2008). The relationship between PWV and arterial stiffness is described by the Moens Korteweg equation (Korteweg, 1878; Moens, 1878):
PWV  Eh / 2r
(3.1) where E=Young's modulus of elasticity of wall material, the h=wall thickness of vessel, the r=inside radius of vessel and ρ=density of blood). Another version of this equation is the Bramwell and Hill equation, which relates PWV to distensibility:
61

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

PWV  P.V V 

1 D

(3.2)

where ΔPV/ΔV=relative volume elasticity of vessel segment, ρ=density of blood, and D=distensibility.

The technique of pulse wave velocity is valid and reproducible and has been widely applied in both normal volunteers and patients in the research setting (Ben‐Shlomo et al., 2014; Blacher et al., 1999; Sutton‐Tyrrell et al., 2005; Takashima et al., 2014).The principle is relatively simple and the technique can be learned fairly easily. While, some studies data show that pulse wave velocity is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk in both hypertensive patients and patients with the end‐stage renal disease, other studies showed weak correlations between PWV and cardiovascular risks and consider the method unreliable for measurement of arterial stiffness (Jerrard‐Dunne et al., 2008; Payne et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2015)

Some limitations of this technique include:

 The inaccessibility of the central arteries, necessitating compromise by using the nearest superficial arteries.
 There can also be some difficulty in estimating the actual arterial distance between recording sites using only surface measurements. The pulse wave velocity becomes less accurate if the recording points are very close together, and the technique is, therefore, limited to use on the larger arteries.
 As stated earlier, PWV is a parameter that is highly affected by blood pressure, arterial geometry and fluid density, and therefore, a change in PWV might be due to other factors apart from AS. For that reason, some studies have considered the method to be unreliable with the weak correlation between PWV and cardiovascular risks to a point where there is no correlation when data was adjusted for gender and age.

3.3.4 Ultrasound‐derived Indices for AS Estimation
Ultrasound can be readily used to measure arterial stiffness (distensibility and compliance), but its use is limited to the larger and more accessible arteries. Hence, this technique has been used mainly on the brachial, femoral and carotid arteries and the abdominal aorta. Several images of the vessel wall are obtained per cardiac cycle, and the maximum and minimum areas of the vessel are calculated by wall tracking and computerised edge‐finding software. Distensibility and hence compliance (inverse of

62

Chapter 3

stiffness) can be calculated using the following formulae if blood pressure is also recorded:

Distensibility  V P.V

(3.3)

Where ΔV=change in volume, ΔP=change in pressure, and V=volume.

Problems associated with the use of ultrasound to assess arterial stiffness include:

The limited resolution can make the detection of very small changes in vessel diameter difficult. The technique also relies heavily on the ability of the operator to image the walls of the vessel being studied accurately, and there have been some concerns about the reproducibility of the technique, although with an experienced operator this can be improved. The technique can be made less operator‐dependent by introducing measures such as fixing the ultrasound transducer in a robotic arm, and maintaining the arm of the subject in a fixed position using a groove or brace (Lee et al., 1992).

It is necessary to measure blood pressure simultaneously to measure the elastic modulus. This is usually done in the brachial artery or finger, which may not be appropriate if distensibility is being assessed in a more central artery, for example, the aorta, due to the normal phenomenon of pressure wave amplification towards the periphery. Moreover, finger blood pressure is not necessarily a reliable measure of brachial blood pressure. It is unclear whether information obtained from one particular site can be generalised to the rest of the vasculature.

Although ultrasound has the advantage of being non‐invasive, the imaging equipment required is not yet integrated in wearable devices and is expensive. Thus, the use of ultrasound in determining arterial stiffness has been largely confined to the research setting to date.
3.3.5 MRI‐derived Indices for AS Estimation
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been used to measure vascular distensibility and compliance. Most of the human studies have been based on measurements of the aorta. MRI has been used to demonstrate the inverse relationship between aortic distensibility and age, that arterial stiffness is increased in hypertensive patients (Resnick et al., 1997), and that arterial compliance is reduced in patients with coronary artery disease but increased in athletes (Mohiaddin et al., 1989). Although MRI has the advantage of being non‐invasive, it remains very expensive, and the availability

63

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

of scanning facilities is limited. Therefore, the place of this technique in clinical practice is doubtful, and it is completely unfeasible for personal healthcare devices.
3.3.6 The Arterial Waveform for AS Estimation
The arterial pressure waveform is a composite of the forward pressure wave created by ventricular contraction and a reflected wave. Waves are reflected from the periphery mainly at branch points or sites of impedance mismatch. Therefore, the arterial waveform varies throughout the arterial tree (Nichols and M.D, 2011). The velocity at which the pressure wave travels through the vasculature is influenced by the stiffness of the vessel walls—the stiffer the walls, the higher the velocity. In the elastic vessels, the reflected wave tends to arrive back at the aortic root during diastole, serving to augment diastolic pressure and hence improve coronary artery perfusion. In the case of stiff arteries, the reflected wave arrives back at the central arteries earlier, causing augmentation of the systolic pressure and a consequent decrease in diastolic pressure. High central systolic pressure accelerates the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas low diastolic pressure reduces coronary artery perfusion. The amplitude of the reflected wave also increases as the arterial stiffness increases, further augmenting central systolic pressure.
The O'Rourke Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) system is a simple and non‐invasive method of measuring arterial stiffness. Applanation tonometry is used to record pressures at the radial or carotid artery, and a validated generalised transfer factor is then applied to derive the corresponding central waveform. From this, the augmentation index (AIx), which is the difference between the first and second systolic peaks expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure, and a measure of systemic stiffness, can be derived. It is also possible to estimate the central arterial pressure from the peripheral waveform (O’Rourke et al., 2001). The estimation of augmentation index using this technique is more reproducible than blood pressure as assessed by some automated sphygmomanometers. The tonometer is easily portable and, therefore, useful in both hospital and clinic settings. However, the method is not feasible for personal healthcare devices and the limitations related to applanation tonometry as mentioned above are not overcome.
Pressure pulse contour analysis is another method which has been used to estimate arterial stiffness non‐invasively. This technique involves tonometry at the radial artery, but the compliance is derived differently, using a modified Windkessel model of the circulation and an assessment of diastolic pressure decay (Rietzschel et al., 2001). This

64

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

method calculates large‐vessel and peripheral compliance. Augmentation index and peripheral compliance, as calculated by pulse contour analysis, are related but augmentation index more accurately reflects drug‐induced haemodynamic changes. Pressure pulse contour analysis requires estimation of cardiac output from an algorithm. The technique does not provide any information on central pressures or augmentation index. Also, it may be less accurate than the technique described above, as the theoretical model depends on the diastolic component of the waveform, which tends to be less reliably recorded than the systolic component. Most of the wave reflection occurs in systole rather than diastole. Also, the point at which diastole is assumed to start and the point in diastole from which the exponential decay is calculated may be affected by the reflected wave, leading to further inaccuracies.
3.3.7 Photoplethysmography in the Assessment of AS
Photoplethysmography has been used to record the digital volume pulse. This technique resembles that of pulse oximetry, and measures the transmission of infrared light through the finger, thus detecting changes in flow and producing a volume waveform. It has been used to develop a stiffness index and a reflection index that are thought to reflect systemic arterial stiffness. Problems include the damping of the peripheral pulse and temperature‐dependant changes in the peripheral circulation. A study that compared Photoplethysmography of the digital volume pulse with pulse wave velocity found that pulse wave velocity correlated more closely with the expected influences on vascular compliance, namely age and atherosclerosis. According to Mackenzie: “the technique has the advantages of being relatively simple and easily portable. If it were to be validated, it would have potential uses in the clinical setting’’(Mackenzie et al., 2002). Photoplethysmography also has been used as a pulse transducer to measure aortic femoral PWV (Loukogeorgakis et al., 2002; Wowern et al., 2015).
Pressure waveform analysis has also been performed more distally on the digital artery using a servo‐controlled pressure cuff. One such example is the Finapres system (Millasseau et al., 2000) which has been successfully used to measure the arterial waveform. However, there are some reservations mentioned above about this method, and that the recorded waveform may be significantly damped and, therefore, any derivations of central pressure may be less accurate.

3.4 Assessment of Blood Viscosity
Blood viscosity is the thickness and stickiness of blood. It is a direct measure of the ability of blood to flow through the vessels. Blood viscosity is non‐Newtonian that inhibits shear‐thinning properties, the factors that contribute to an increase or drop in blood viscosity have been discussed in more details in the previous chapter. Medically, it is possible to find abundant evidence throughout the literature that blood viscosity can be a significant indicator of cardiovascular disease. A strong link has been reported in thrombosis (Dintenfass, 1964), hypertension (Letcher et al., 1983; Pop et al., 2002), myocardial infarction (Jan et al., 1975; Turczyński et al., 2002), cardiovascular complications (Cho et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 1997) and acute stroke (Coull et al., 1991; Gusev et al., 2008). Elevated blood viscosity (hyperviscosity) is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes (Irace et al., 2013), obesity (Solá et al., 2007) and smoking (Shimada et al., 2011).
Viscosity is classically measured in one of two ways: by determining the rate of fluid flow as a result of applying a predefined force or by measuring the amount of force required to achieve a predefined rate of fluid flow.
To measure the viscosity of a sample, modern viscometers generally measure the rate of fluid flow at a specified force or, conversely, the amount of force required to achieve a predefined rate of flow. It does not matter which method is used for plasma and serum viscosity measurement. The result should be the same because plasma and serum are Newtonian fluids. However, the latter method is most appropriate for measuring whole blood viscosity because whole blood is a non‐Newtonian fluid. The viscosity of whole blood varies depending on the rate of flow. Therefore, the rate of flow (proportional to shear rate) ideally should be precisely measured.
The viscosity of fluids is most frequently measured by instruments that fall into one of two categories, either rotational or tube instruments.
3.4.1 Viscosity Measurement Methods 3.4.1.1 Capillary viscometers
Capillary viscometers are available in different designs as seen in Figure 3-4. Measurements using capillary viscometers are based on the relation between viscosity and time. They use gravity as the driving force; therefore, the results are kinematic viscosity values. The main advantage of this method is that gravity is a highly reliable driving force(Lauda GmbH, 2016).

There are direct‐flow or reverse‐flow capillaries available. In direct‐flow capillaries the sample reservoir is located below the measuring marks; in reverse‐flow types, the reservoir sits above the marks. Reverse‐flow capillaries allow the testing of opaque liquids and can have a third measuring mark. Having three measuring marks provides two subsequent flow times and can define the measurement's determinability.

Viscosity values are obtained using the following relationship

Where is kinematic viscoisty (mm2/s), KC is the capillary factor (mm2/s2) and tf is the sample flow time (s).

While capillary viscometers might be suitable for measurement of plasma viscosity such as the commercially available BV200, its principles do not apply to non‐Newtonian fluids, such as blood.

3.4.1.2 Rotational viscometers Rotational viscometers consist of one stationary element and one rotary element separated by a thin layer of fluid. As the rotary element is spun, the viscous forces of the fluid interact with both the rotating body and the stationary body, having the net effect of impeding the motion of the rotating body. Rotational viscometers can be further divided into one of two types, co‐axial cylinder, and cone‐plate viscometers.

Coaxial Cylinder Viscometers The co‐axial rotating cylinder viscometer consists of a cylinder, which houses a concentrically mounted solid cylinder. The fluid is placed between the outer and inner

67

cylinders. The inner cylinder (Searle type viscometer) or the outer cylinder (Couette type viscometer) are capable of forced rotation. The viscous drag created by the fluid between the outer and inner cylinders is measured as a function of the angular displacement of the inner cylinder (Viswanath et al., 2007).
Cone-plate Viscometers The cone‐plate viscometer (see Figure 3-5) operates in a similar fashion to the coaxial cylinder viscometers. A cup with a flat bottom serves as both the vessel, which contains the fluid, and the plate at which the fluid builds a viscous resistance (Cokelet, 2011).
A rotating cone with the large angle at the apex transmits a torque on the system. The drag exerted by the interaction between the viscosity of the fluid and the stationary and rotating surfaces is measured by the deflection of a spring mounted on the shaft between the cone and the motor.

3.4.1.3 Rolling ball viscometers Rolling-ball viscometer operating concept is seen in Figure 3-6 measures the rolling time of a ball through transparent and opaque liquids according to Hoeppler's falling ball principle (Viswanath et al., 2007).

Figure 3-6 Illustration of the Rolling ball viscometer principle. FG is the effective component of gravity, FB is the effective component of buoyancy and Fv is the viscous force (Viscopedia, 2016).
The rolling‐ball principle uses gravity as the driving force. A ball rolls through a closed capillary filled with sample fluid which is inclined at a defined angle. The time it takes the ball to travel a defined measuring distance is a measure of the fluid’s viscosity. The inclination angle of the capillary permits the user to vary the driving force. If the angle is too steep, the rolling speed causes turbulent flow. For calculating the viscosity from the measured time, the fluid’s density, and the ball density needs to be known. Instruments that perform at inclination angles between 10° and 80° are rolling‐ball viscometers. If the inclination angle is 80° or greater, the instrument is referred to as a falling‐ball viscometer. Apart from balls as falling objects, there are other viscometers
69

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

which use rods or needles. Another variety of this principle is the bubble viscometer, which registers the rising time of an air bubble in the sample over a defined distance. The oscillating piston viscometer (ASTM D 7483) is an exception: It does not rely on gravity as the driving force but uses electromagnetic force to pull a magnetic cylinder through the sample (Viswanath et al., 2007).

As seen in Figure 3-6, a number of force components affect this type of measurement. FG is the component of gravitational force as the gravity pulls the ball downwards, FB is the effective component of buoyancy where the buoyancy inside the liquid and the liquid's viscosity oppose the gravitational force (Viswanath et al., 2007). And finally, Fv is the viscous force of the liquid which causes the friction to the rolling ball. To calculate the ball’s viscosity from the rolling time, the gravitational and buoyancy influence have to be considered. While the influence of gravity (FG) depends on the ball's density and volume, an object's buoyancy depends also on the liquid's density as can be described with Newton’s second law:

FG  m.g  .V .g

(3.8)

Where m is mass in kg, g, is gravitational acceleration (m/s2) and  is density (kg/m3).

The dynamic viscosity  (mPa.s) can be calculated from the following relationship:

  K.(b  s ).tr

(3.9)

Where K is the proportionality constant, b is the ball density (g/cm3), s is the sample density (g/cm3) and tr is the ball rolling time (s).

3.4.2 Challenges in Blood Viscosity Measurement in the Clinical Setting
There has been no evidence that blood viscosity measurement is implemented in regulatory assessments of cardiovascular patients in the US or the UK. However, some private clinics have adopted these tests more recently. However, regulatory assessment of plasma viscosity is common for diagnosis purposes for patients with hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS), multiple myelomas and Waldenstrom Macroglobulinaemia (WM) with symptomatic hyperviscosity.

Although hyperviscosity syndrome is caused by hyperviscous blood, clinical laboratories generally only measure the serum or plasma component. The methods used for the measurement of serum or plasma viscosity in patients have changed little since Waldenström's use of a capillary viscometer in 1944 (Waldenström, 1944). College of

70

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

American Pathologists (CAP) data for 2010 reveal that approximately 75% of clinical laboratories use a capillary viscometer (Mancia et al., 2007). In the UK the BV200 capillary Viscometers (Benson Viscometers Ltd, UK) are widely common in the clinical setting for plasma viscosity measurements. In the case of Polycythaemia, where blood viscosity is evident to increase, only full blood count is a regulatory test in the UK. Other measurements used for general health screening is erythrocyte sedimentation rate using Starrsed ESR (Mechatronics International, Netherlands). Bleeding disorders are commonly assessed using the clotting Screen by assessing prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time and D‐Dimer, using the ACL Top (Werfen company, US) and is part of the regulatory tests in the National Health Services in the UK (Chee et al., 2008).
The simplicity of the tube method for viscosity measurement encounter a lack of standardisation and subtle risks for imprecision. Laboratories using the Ostwald and pipette methods report their data as ratios rather than in units of viscosity, such as centipoise (cp). The results are reported as the ratio of time for a patient sample to pass through the tube relative to the time for a reference fluid (eg, water). Consequently, commercial viscosity controls traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology standard, reported in centipoise, are not directly applicable. The Ostwald and pipette methods lack the kind of standardised commercial calibrators and controls that are commonplace for other haematology or chemistry assays. The Ostwald tube remains a simple, reliable method for measuring relative serum viscosity in patients. In a study where 499 serum viscosity determinations were performed, 297 (59.5%) of which were elevated (Stone, 2009). A total of 60% of these specimens were reproducible to ± 5% and usually available within 3 hours.
Commercially available viscosity instrumentation generally does not focus on the clinical laboratory. Instead, viscosity instrumentation is sold primarily for industrial applications, which represent much larger markets. Industrial applications for viscosity measurement include measuring the viscosity of paint, solvents, oil and petrochemicals, resins, and polymers. The US Food and Drug Administration classifies viscometers as class I devices (21 CFR 862.2920), requiring only establishment registration before product distribution in the United States. Comapnies registered under that classification do not market viscometers to clinical laboratories. The LV2000 micro‐viscometer (Anton Paar, Austria) relies on the rolling‐ball concept and provides a point‐of‐care whole blood viscometer, currently labelled for research use only. Coulter (Miami, FL, US) manufactured and

71

Chapter 3

Current State of the Art

marketed a viscometer to the clinical laboratory almost two decades ago. The line was discontinued after a few years, and none is marketed currently primarily to the clinical laboratory. Therefore, clinical laboratory professionals must choose among instruments that are not intended primarily for clinical laboratory use but are easily adaptable with proper validation.
The most common method used in recent research studies for blood viscosity measurement is the cone/plate type such as the DV‐III Brookfield Rheometer (Wells‐ Brookfield, Stoughton, MA) (Irace et al., 2013; Solá et al., 2007) or the MCR301 Rheometer (MCR series, Anton Paar) (Forsyth et al., 2011). However, CAP data reveal that only 7% of clinical laboratories use the cone/plate type of viscometer (Stone and Bogen, 2012). Most validation studies linking HVS to a particular serum or plasma viscosity were performed using the Ostwald tube. Consequently, the viscosity ratios (normalised to water at 20°C) may not exactly match the viscosity measured by an automated method, expressed in centipoise.
3.4.3 Non‐invasive Methods for BV Measurement (Research Investigations)
There have been few investigations for ex‐vivo optical measurements of blood viscosity. One of these method report on a contact‐free optical viscosity measurement technique using a laser‐induced capillary wave (Muramoto and Nagasaka, 2011). Two pulsed YAD laser beams of equal wavelength and intensities intersect on a weak absorbing sample surface at a specified crossing angle. They generate an intensity distribution within the volume grating interference pattern with the grating period between 80 and 100 µm. The temperature distribution of the thermal grating creates a spatially modulated displacement on the liquid surface driven by the thermal expansion and the temperature dependencies the surface tension. By solving the Navier‐stokes equation, the continuity equation, and the heat conduction equation with appropriate boundary conditions using the Laplace transformation, viscosity, and surface tension can be both determined. This method brings the benefit of a contact‐free method, high‐speed measurement and high spatial resolution, small sample volume and a wide range of viscosity.
Recently, an in vivo blood viscosity monitoring method was suggested using a central venous catheter using electrical impedance (Pop et al., 2013). The method showed agreement with in vitro blood viscosity measurements using the coaxial viscometer (Contraves LS 300 instrument, proRheo GmbH, Germany).

SUMMARY
Assessment of cardiovascular mechanics is vital for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular health, especially in the early stages of hypertension and atherosclerosis for prevention of further complications. In this chapter, the source of CVD progression and development in the preclinical and asymptomatic CVD patients is narrowed to the three major parameters documented in the literature; blood pressure, arterial stiffness and blood viscosity. A range of methods are available for measurement of arterial BP, however, these methods endure limitations due to reliability, discomfort, portability, and cost efficiency. A variety of indices are used for the assessment of AS, however, there is a disparity in the reliability of measurement of cardiovascular risks especially after adjustment for age and gender. Currently available methods for measurement of blood viscosity are invasive methods and the assessment of BV is limited to measurement of plasma viscosity only, this might be due to the lack of specially designed technique for clinical instruments.
Photoplethysmography is an optical technique that has the benefits of being non‐ invasive, it provides a continuous pulse wave signal and requires no specialised practitioner to obtain the signal and can be manufactured at low‐cost. Therefore, we aim to investigate the PPG and its potential and limitations in providing a measure of vascular mechanics, by assessing its capability in the quantification of BP and AS and its sensitivity to BV.

4.1 Introduction
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique and therefore, it is important to provide a thorough background of light interactions with biological tissue. Once the light reaches the skin, part of it is absorbed, part is reflected or scattered, and part is further transmitted. The understanding of the factors related to the light‐tissue interaction is essential for understanding PPG. For that reason, we will only investigate the light characteristics that are relative to this application.
Long established laws, observations and definitions relevant to the quantification and measurement of light absorption and scattering are presented in this chapter. Biological tissue is inhomogeneous, therefore, light propagation within such a tissue depends on the scattering and absorption properties of its components: cells, cell organelles, and various fibre structures. The optical properties of refractive index, scattering and absorption coefficients; and the polarisation states of the incident light all play important roles in the propagation of light in tissues (Tuchin, 2007).
A review of how light propagates in the skin layers, RBCs, and the relevant chromophores will be discussed by presenting the relevant optical parameters in tissue components.

power of light was often attributed to mythological, religious, and supernatural powers. The history of light therapy dates back to the ancient Egyptians, Persian, Hindus, Romans, and Greeks, all of whom created temples to worship the therapeutic powers of light, especially sunlight, for healing the body as well as the mind and the soul (Bohren and Huffman, 2007).

Today, light is studied as optics, a branch of physics. Where, this science deals with the nature of light and the phenomenon exhibited by it (Bohren and Huffman, 2007). For a glimpse of the evolution of light theories, Newton in his corpuscular theory (1675 AD) assumed that light consists of very small particles, which he named corpuscles. Those corpuscles are emitted from a luminous source and travel with high speed. Using this theory, only rectilinear propagation of light (reflection and refraction) can be explained. However, the theory was unable to explain interference, diffraction and polarisation. Huygens’ wave theory of light (1678 AD) considered light to consist of periodic disturbance transmitted through a medium in the form of longitudinal waves. Where the source of light creates periodic disturbances that behave as waves. This theory can explain reflection, refraction, interference and diffraction (Bohren and Huffman, 2007). In the nineteenth century, Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory (1873), which assumed light to be electromagnetic in nature, has arrived to rule out the concept of elastic ether1, as no material medium is required for the propagation of light. Max Plank proposed, the quantum theory of light, in which light consists of small particles in the form of discrete bundles of energy called photons (Splinter and Hooper, 2007).

The energy of a photon is equal to hf, where f is its frequency and h is the Planck’s constant.

E=hf

Today, the present understanding of light is that it possesses dual characteristics. Where sometimes it manifests its wave nature (reflection, refraction, diffraction, polarisation), while in other times, it manifests its particle nature as in photoelectric effect, Raman effect and Compton effect (Jha, 2009).

Light‐Tissue Interactions

The most relevant optical properties applicable to Photoplethysmography are light absorption,scattering, and refraction. The following section will introduce definitions and principles related to those properties.
4.2.1 Light Absorption
Light absorption refers to the loss of photonic energy during interaction with electrons, atoms, and molecules. The energy lost by photons is converted into either heat or light of longer wavelengths (Splinter and Hooper 2007).

Figure 4-1 Attenuation of light through a non‐scattering medium.

In the 18th century, the Beer‐Lamber‐Bouguer law or as commonly known as Lambert‐ Beer law was introduced to describe the logarithmic attenuation of light travelling through an absorbing medium. In a substance consisting of different layers of equal thicknesses, each absorbs the same fraction of an incident beam of light. The first layer will absorb ½ of the incident light, the second will absorb ¼ the incident light and only 1/8 will emerge from the next layer.

A collimated beam of light of Intensity I0 at the wavelength will attenuate across a homogenous and non‐scattering medium of thickness d with the given equation:

dI/I = .

(4.2)

Which describes how each successive layer of d of the medium absorbs the same fraction dI/I of the incident intensity I for a constant μ . The latter is known as the absorption coefficient of a medium in mm‐1 for a given wavelength , and it represents the probability of the photon being absorbed through one unit of length in that medium.

For an incident intensity I0 , the transmitted intensity Id through a distance d will be

Id = I0. .

(4.3)

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

Where, is the absorption coefficient of a medium in mm‐1 for a given wavelength, , and it represents the probability of the photon being absorbed through one unit of length in that medium. The reciprocal of the absorption coefficient, known as the absorption length m is the distance required for the intensity of the beam to fall to e‐1 of the initial intensity. Expressing the previous equation in base 10 logarithms:

Id = I0.10

(4.4)

Where is the specific absorption coefficient of the compound (mm/molar).

The absorbance of the medium A, or the dimensionless light attenuation, given in optical density units (OD) is defined as the log10 ratio of the incident and transmitted intensities

A = log10 (I0 / Id)

(4.5)

In the 19th Century, August Beer derived a law stating that the optical density of a non‐ absorbing medium, with an absorbing substance dissolved in it, is proportional to the concentration ([C], molars) of the absorbing substance.

The combination of the two laws is commonly known as the Beer‐Lambert Law and can be written as:

A = log10 (I0 / Id) = ℇ.[C].d

(4.6)

Where, ℰ is the specific extinction coefficient or the absorptivity of the compound (mm/molar) and the distance (d) crossed by the light through the solution.

In the case where the medium contains several different compounds, the above equation can be extended to consider the contribution of each compound. (For instance, in a blood solution, the different compounds are oxy‐haemoglobin, deoxy‐haemoglobin, water, etc.)

A( ) = ℰ ( ).[C1].d + ℰ ( ).[C2].d + …ℰ ( ).[ ].d

A( )= ∑ ℰ ( ). [ ].

(4.7)

log10 (I0 / Id ) = ( ).[C1].d + ( ).[C2].d + … ( ).[Cn].d

log10 (I0 / Id ) = ∑ ( ). [ ].

(4.8)

Transmittance T can also be defined by the following ratio,

T = Id / I0

(4.9)

The Beer‐Lambert law is only valid under certain limited conditions: the light entering the medium must be monochromatic and perfectly collimated, and the medium itself

77

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

must be purely and uniformly absorbing. Therefore, certain errors will arise when applying the law to practical measurements since, for example, even lasers are not perfectly monochromatic. The consequences on experimental measurements of the limitations imposed by the Beer‐Lambert law will be highlighted at a later stage.
4.2.2 Light Scattering
The fundamentals of the theory behind light scattering and its definitive parameters are introduced. This discussion will highlight elastic scattering, in which there is no loss in energy of the scattered light, on the grounds that non‐linear scattering in tissue is generally not as significant in the used wavelengths for Photoplethysmography monitoring.

Figure 4-2 Distribution of the scattered light relative to the incident light. The incident photon travels along the direction ̂ and the scattered photon exits in ̂′ direction (Vo, 2003).
Light scattering can be elastic or inelastic. In the event of elastic scattering, the photons experience a change in direction without any loss of energy and this is more frequent than the inelastic scattering such as Raman scattering, where photons can both gain and lose energy. Scattering of a photon can even be treated as absorption of the photon followed by the immediate emission of a new photon (Ball, 2001; Hecht, 2002). Scattering is mostly described by considering the incident light as a plane wave; a wave of uniform amplitude in any plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, at least over a size scale larger than the scattering particle. Scattering is quantified by the scattering cross section. For a monochromatic plane wave that has a given intensity I0 encountering the medium, some amount of power Pscat gets spatially scattered. The ratio
78

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

of the scattered energy to the incident intensity is the scattering cross section (σ ) as illustrated in Figure 4-2.

( ̂) = Pscatt /I0

(4.10)

where ̂ is the propagation direction.

The angular distribution of the scattered radiation is given by the differential cross section ( ̂, ̂′), where ̂ defines the axis of a cone of solid angle dΩ originating at the scatterer.

Assuming that the scattering section is independent of the light orientation of the incident light and the scatterer, which leave us with ( ̂) = and hence,

( ̂, ̂′) = ( ̂, ̂′)

(4.11)

The differential cross section, which represents the angular distribution of the scattered light depends on the polarisation states of the incoming and outgoing waves, as with the scattering cross section.

A medium containing a uniform distribution of identical scatterers is characterised by the scattering coefficient and the cross‐sectional area for scattering per unit volume of medium.

where is the density of scatterers.

(4.13)

The light which is absorbed is dissipated as thermal energy, and light which is scattered keeps its intensity but travels in another direction (Martelli et al., 2010). Therefore, it is convenient to describe the angular distribution of scattered light by defining an angular probability function of a photon to be scattered by an angle . If all scatter directions are equally probable, the scattering is isotropic. Otherwise, scattering is anisotropic.

In elastic scattering, when a photon is scattered from its original direction S, a measure of the anisotropy of scattering is given by the coefficient of anisotropy g, which represents the average value of the cosine of the scattering angle. This can be expressed as

Light‐Tissue Interactions

(4.14)

Light scattering can be classified into three modes of light‐particle interaction: Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, and Raman scattering. The occurrence of Rayleigh or Mie scattering is determined principally be the ratio of the wavelength of the incident light (λ) to the dimensions of the scattering particle. Rayleigh scattering occurs when λ is much larger than the dimensions of the scattering particle and Mie scattering when the dimensions are comparable. Both Rayleigh and Mie scattering are elastic and cause a change in the trajectory of the scattered photon only. Raman scattering describes a phenomenon in which the trajectory of the scattered photon is altered, but in addition, the interaction causes the emission of light, usually with longer wavelength, from the scattering particle (Splinter and Hooper, 2007).

4.2.2.1 Rayleigh Limit Scattering of light by tissue components that are much smaller than the photon wavelength involves the Rayleigh limit. The tissue structure includes cellular components such as membranes, cell sub‐compartments and extracellular components such as the banded ultrastructure of collagen fibrils. The most important implication of the small size‐to‐wavelength ratio is that, at any moment in time, the scatter sees only a spatially uniform electric field in the surrounding host. In the classical description, where light is seen as waves, this condition gives rise to a dipole moment in the scatterer, a slight and spatially simple redistribution of the charges in the scatterer. This dipole moment oscillates in time with the frequency of the incident field and as a consequence gives off dipole radiation. For a spherical particle of radius, (a), the differential cross section in the Rayleigh limit is

= 8π n

(1+cos2θ),

(4.15)

Where is the angle between the direction of the arriving wave and the leaving direction of interest, and nm and ns are the refractive indices of the host medium and the scatterer, respectively.
4.2.2.2 Mie Solution The Mie regime scattering to objects approximately of the same size as the wavelength of the incident light, which translated to tissue conditions corresponds to cellular structures and collagen fibres. Mie‐scattering is dependent on wavelength and highly forward directed. This is predominant in light interaction with biological tissue. The

80

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

interaction closely approximates geometrical optics. The cross‐section of the scattering particle and the angle of incidence of the photon are used to determine an anisotropy factor g, which is the probability that the photon will be scattered in a solid angle θ. Various cellular structures, such as mitochondria and nuclei, and extracellular components like collagen fibres have sizes on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns and are comparable in dimension to the photon wavelengths generally used in biomedical applications (0.5 to 1 µm).
Even though these structures are not necessarily spherical, their scattering behaviour can be modelled reasonably well by Mie theory applied to spheres of comparable size and refractive index. Because the scatterer is on the order of the wavelength, it experiences a more complex field in the space around it at any moment in time, and thus the motion of charges in the scatterer in response to the field is also complex (Hecht, 2002).
This results in a more complex angular dependence for the scattered light relative to the Rayleigh approximation. There can also be resonances due to the (classical) constructive and destructive interferences of the fields set up in the scatterer. The exact scattering patterns exhibited by the various biologic structures will crucially depend on the detailed shape of the particle.
4.2.2.3 Raman Scattering In the quantum picture, Rayleigh and Mie scattering is called “elastic” because the energy of the scattered photon is the same as that of the incident photon. A related process is Raman scattering, which, in contrast, is “inelastic.” In the Raman process, the frequencies of scattered photons are shifted from the incident frequency by amounts that are characteristic of molecular transitions, usually between vibrational energy states. The term inelastic refers to the fact that the scattered photon either loses energy to (Stokes) or gains energy from (anti‐Stokes) the molecule. Raman scattering is extremely weak compared to the elastic Rayleigh scattering. A rough approximation would be that for every 1 Raman‐shifted photon there are 106 Rayleigh photons (Vo, 2003). A more precise way of describing the Raman scattering effect is to consider the wave nature of light, rather than a photon in this occasion. Only the electrical component of the electromagnetic wave interacts with molecules in a material to produce Raman Scattering. Both important characteristics are the effect the material has on the properties of the electric field (E) and conversely the effect the electric field has on the material as the light wave passes through the sample (Splinter and Hooper, 2007).

81

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

Because of its weak scattering compared to elastic Raleigh scattering, Raman scattering discussion will not be taken further in relation to PPG.

4.2.3 Refraction
Refractive Index N is a measure of the bending of a ray of light when passing from one medium into another. It is determined by the speed of light in the medium. At boundaries, abrupt or continuous, changes in the refractive index increase scattering, refraction and reflection, while refraction usually occurs when light is incident at the boundary between two media with different refractive indices (see Figure 4-3) and is governed by Snell’s Law as below:

v1.sin( ) = v2.sin( )

(4.16)

where , the angle of incidence, is the anlge of refraction, v1 and v2 are the speeds of light in the media, and are related to the refractive index of each medium (n = cvaccum/ν).

Figure 4-3 Refraction of light at the junction between two media with different refractive indices.
Since skin tissues are heterogeneous in composition, one may need to know the refractive indices for the various tissue constituents or an averaged value for the tissue as a whole. The refractive index is around 1.4 for most tissue types (Delpy et al., 1988). Table 4-1 presents some of the refractive indices in different cellular elements.

4.3 Optical Properties of Biological Tissues
In Photoplethysmography the light is directed towards the skin, where the structure of the skin layers, blood vessels and blood flow and a number of chromophores react to the light in different ways.
4.3.1 Optical Pathways in Skin
In this section, the optical properties of the biological tissues related to PPG are discussed. The skin has a very complex structure that consists of a variety of cells, fibres, and other components make up several different layers that give skin a multi‐layered structure. Veins, capillaries, and nerves form vast networks inside this structure. Light incident on skin traverses various pathways in each layer of the skin. Figure 4-4 shows a schematic of the optical pathways in the skin layers. By assuming that the optical properties to be homogeneous on a cellular level, we can estimate the optical properties of each skin layer. Previous work on the optical properties of skin layers or cutaneous optics has employed this approximation of homogeneousity (Aravind Krishnaswamy and Baranoski, 2004). In this discussion, we consider absorption and scattering to be uniformly distributed across skin layers (Anderson and Parrish, 1981; Nielsen et al., 2008).

Light‐Tissue Interactions

Figure 4-4 A schematic of the optical pathways in skin relating light wavelength and depth of penetration in skin in millimeters (GBS, 2015).
A part of the incident light is first reflected at the surface of the skin, due to the difference in the refractive indices of the outermost layer of the skin; the stratum corneum. The epidermis propagates and absorbs light. The absorption property comes mostly from the natural chromophore, melanin. The melanin absorption level depends on how many melanosomes per unit volume are in the epidermis, which varies from one individual to another from 1.3% volume of the epidermis in lightly pigmented specimens to 43% fraction in darkly pigmented specimens (Aravind Krishnaswamy and Baranoski, 2004). It has been proved that transmission of the light varies according to the skin type. The low‐melanin dermis transmits from about 50% at 400 nm to 90% at 1,200 nm, while the high‐melanin epidermis transmits less than 40% at 400 nm and 90% at 1,200 nm. In general, there is a gradual increase in skin penetration at longer wavelengths. This phenomenon is responsible for the desired effects on the tissue. The structures of the tissue that absorb the photons are known as chromophores and will be discussed in more detail.

Light‐Tissue Interactions

Light also propagates in the dermis layer, a layer primarily composed of dense, irregular connective tissue with nerves and blood vessels that vary in size. Where light interacts mainly with the chromophores. Moreover, the dermis is optically thick, and can be viewed as a turbid medium, where a significant amount of scattering takes place. Multiple scattering takes place in the vast network of collagen fibres. As a result, scattering by the dermis can be described as multiple scattering, and it appears to be isotropic throughout the layer, although scattering due to a single collagen fibre is strong in the forward direction (Sandell and Zhu, 2011).
It is important to note that optical interaction with skin layers will majorly contribute to the non‐pulsatile component of the PPG signal.
4.3.2 Optical Properties of Erythrocytes
Erythrocytes or Red Blood Cells (RBCs) occupy the vast majority of blood volume and hence, they are of major interest to studying the PPG signal. Erythrocytes contain the strongest absorbers of visible light in the human body, haemoglobin (Hb), and the cells can be easily isolated and studied experimentally. Moreover, the erythrocytes do no show internal structure which allows the opportunity to apply theoretical models of scattering to these cells. The PPG signal is concerned with the pulsatile flow which originates from blood volume changes in the vascular bed and hence, the main focus of this project will be directed towards the role of erythrocytes and their effect on the PPG signal. This section will discuss the main studies that addressed the optical properties of erythrocytes.
The optical properties of erythrocytes have been widely studied in many investigations Some of these investigations are theoretical where, Reynolds et al assumed that the erythrocyte obeys Mie scattering (Reynolds et al., 1976). The absorption and the scattering cross sections obtained from Mie theory were also used by Schmitt et al and Steinke and Shepherd, who described light transport in whole blood by applying the diffusion approximation (Schmitt et al., 1986) and who also did experimental work on the oxygen content of erythrocytes in a flow cell (Steinke and Shepherd, 1988). Moreover, Roggan at al also investigated the optical properties of circulating human blood in a flow cuvette (Roggan et al., 1999). The study investigates such properties in the visible and near infrared range using diffuse backscattering, total transmission and the non‐ scattered transmission of thin samples. Blood samples were gently stirred and kept flowing through a turbulence‐free cuvette with a linear flow and an optical path of 97 µm.

4.3.2.1 Effect of Haematocrit

Erythrocytes obtain absorption and scattering properties dependant on the haematocrit

value. This is evident due to the effect of Hct on the absorption and scattering coefficients

as seen in Figure 4-5. In the study performed by Roggan et al, an increase in Hct up to

50% led to a linear increase in absorption coefficient and a scattering coefficient also

increased proportionally but only for values <10% (Roggan et al., 1999). The anisotropy

factor was almost constant with 0.002 variations. The scattering coefficient appeared to

be independent of blood concentration at Hct>10, and the g factor decreased

continuously at Hct 70%, The reduced scattering coefficient

4.3.2.2 Effect of flow velocity Roggan et al investigated the effect of flow velocity on the optical properties. The study concluded that low velocities have a significant impact on the optical properties of blood as seen in Figure 4-6.

4.3.2.3 Effect of haemolysis The same study by Roggan et al also observed optical properties obtained from completely haemolysed blood samples without removing the membrane residuals as shown in Figure 4-7. The absorption coefficient significantly decreased with increase haemolysis. Scattering coefficient showed a distinct decrease with increasing haemolysis. At complete haemolysis, s amounted to 18% of the value measured for intact blood. The anisotropy factor (g) was constant up to 50% haemolysis and slightly decreased at higher rates. Reduced scattering coefficient decreased continuously reaching values 16% compared to intact blood (Roggan et al., 1999).

Light‐Tissue Interactions

Figure 4-7 Mean values of the absorption coefficient, anisotropy g, scattering coefficient and reduced scattered coefficient versus extent of haemolysis (Roggan et al., 1999).
The effect of haemolysis highlights that when the erythrocytes are destroyed, their haemoglobin is distributed into the whole solution, resulting in a refractive index match and hence the erythrocytes lose their scattering properties. Moreover, the residual membranes have only a minor impact on the scattering properties due to their negligible thickness which is estimated at 4 nm.
4.3.3 Chromophores
The total number of endogenous chromophores that can be found in human tissue is vast. However, most chromophores are only present in smaller concentrations, making them less prominent. Others are active in wavelength regions outside of the interest of this study. Some chromophores even emit light after absorption and are hence named fluorophores, which will not be discussed in this study for their relatively very minor contributions to PPG signals (Kamal et al., 1989).
4.3.3.1 Haemoglobin A large group of haemoproteins are responsible for the oxygen‐carrying function in the body. Once such haemoprotein is haemoglobin (Hb), the actual absorption spectrum of
88

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

Hb depends primarily on oxygen‐rich blood or oxygen‐poor blood. Hb derivatives also exist, however, they do not contribute to the transport of oxygen.
The derivatives include methaemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin, which are reversible but the formation of sulfhaemoglobin is irreversible. The dysfunctional derivatives differ in absorption, more or less drastically, compared to the functional haemoglobin (Zijlstra et al., 2000). Also, the concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb change according to the function and metabolism of the tissue. Thus, the corresponding changes in absorption can provide clinically useful physiological information. The absorption spectra as obtained by Zijlstra for Hb and some of its derivatives are shown in Figure 4-8.

Figure 4-8 Haemoglobin and its derivatives optical absorption spectra (Zijlstra et al., 2000).
4.3.3.2 Melanin Melanins are the biological pigments ranging in colour from the yellow and red‐brown pheomelanin to the brown and black eumelanin. They are found in skin, hair, eyes and retina. The melanin is produced in the melanocytes in the stratum basal of the epidermis. From this layer, the melanin granules, diffuse out into the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum via the melanocytic dendrites (Aravind Krishnaswamy and Baranoski, 2004).
There are two types of melanin with slightly different absorption spectra as shown in Figure 4-9, eumelanin, and pheomelanin. The Melanin Absorption level depends on how many melanosomes per unit volume are in the epidermis, which varies from one individual to another from 1.3% volume of the epidermis in lightly pigmented specimens
89

Chapter 4

Light‐Tissue Interactions

to 43% fraction in darkly pigmented specimens (Aravind Krishnaswamy and Baranoski, 2004). Those variations can affect Photoplethysmography signals, which will be discussed later.
It is not the amount of melanin producing units, melanocytes, per square millimetre that determines the colour of the skin, but it is rather the size, amount and distribution of the melanosomes in the keratinocytes that differ. Darker individuals have a higher melanin production and wider distribution of the melanin granules even in the stratum corneum. Fair‐skinned individuals, in contrast, have less melanin and the melanin is present as aggregated small melanin granules spread in the epidermis but not present in the stratum corneum. It has also been proposed that melanin extinction is largely due to scattering in the melanin granules. Melanin shows a Rayleigh scattering behaviour and the melanin granules can be regarded as scattering particles. The scattering process has been proposed as originating from the structural formation of melanosomes which, to some extent, act as a polarizer in the skin (Joely Kaufman et al., 2012; Wolbarsht et al., 1981).

4.3.3.3 Lipids Different lipids, or body fat, can be found throughout the body, e.g. the subcutaneous fat layer and epicardial fat. Adipose tissue containing most of the lipids in different constellations is considered as scattering tissue. However, it can also act as an absorbing substance with its own characteristic absorption (van Veen et al., 2005).

4.3.3.4 Water Water is a weak absorbing chromophore in the visible wavelength range, but shows increased absorption both in the UV but also in the NIR region as shown in Figure 4-10. Water is one of few molecules that colour light due to pure vibrational states of the molecule, and it is found throughout the whole body in the intracellular as well as extracellular fluid, e.g. in the plasma of the blood. The concentration of water ranges from 11% in adipose tissue to 92% in the plasma in humans (Tortora and Derrickson, 2008).

5.1 Introduction
In the previous chapters, we have covered basic concepts of the cardiovascular system, the current state of the art in cardiovascular assessment and basic physical concepts of light interaction with biological tissues. This project is primarily focused on the investigation of the fundamentals of Photoplethysmography (PPG) and the potential of the technique to assess “markers” contributing to cardiovascular disease. PPG describes the study of illumination alterations due to changes in a physical parameter, such as volume, in a localised region of tissues. The basic form of PPG consists of: A light source to illuminate the skin, and a photodetector (PD) to measure the small variations in the light intensity, associated with changes in volume changes. It is a non‐invasive technique and usually utilises Red (R) and Infrared (IR) wavelengths.
It is essential to highlight that the true origin of PPG signal is still a subject of debate across all published literature. However, is broadly accepted that Photoplethysmography provides a recording of the pulsatile changes in the microvascular bed of tissue.
This chapter presents a review of the principles of the waveform and operation modes, early and recent history of Photoplethysmography, approaches to investigate the origin

of the signal, the relevant aspects of the practical use of the signal and the limitations associated with the technique and its applications.
5.2 Principles of the PPG waveform
The PPG waveform is divided into two main components:
1. The non‐pulsating DC component, a relatively constant voltage offset of which the magnitude is determined by the nature of the non‐pulsating material through which the tissue passes. The slowly changing DC component may be extracted using a low pass filter. It includes low‐ frequency components, under 0.5 Hz, attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation (Webster, 1997).
2. The pulsatile AC component. Two important characteristics of the PPG AC pulse waveform were described by Hertzman and Spealman (Hertzman and Spealman, 1937). The appearance of the pulse was defined as two phases: The anacrotic phase being the rising edge of the pulse, and the catacrotic phase being the falling edge of the pulse. The first phase is primarily concerned with systole, and the second phase with diastole and wave reflections from the periphery. A dicrotic notch is usually seen in the catacrotic phase of subjects with healthy compliant arteries. The AC‐ component is synchronised with the heart rate (Webster, 1997).
A typical PPG signal is shown in Figure 5-1.

5.3 Modes of Operation
The PPG can operate in either transmission or reflection mode (Mannheimer, 2007; Nijboer et al., 1981). In the transmission mode, the light transmitted through the medium is detected by a PD opposite the LED source, while in reflectance mode, the PD detects light that is back‐scattered or reflected from tissue, bone and/or blood vessels as illustrated in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2 Light‐emitting diode (LED) and photodetector (PD) placement for transmission‐ and reflectance‐ mode Photoplethysmography (PPG) (Tamura et al., 2014).
The transmission mode is capable of obtaining a relatively good signal, but the measurement site may be limited. The sensor must be located on the body at a site where transmitted light can be readily detected, such as the fingertip, nasal septum, cheek, tongue, or earlobe. The fingertip and earlobe are the preferred monitoring positions. Reflectance mode eliminates the problems associated with sensor placement, and a variety of measurement sites can be used. However, reflection‐mode PPG is affected more
94

Chapter 5

Photoplethysmography

by motion artefacts and pressure disturbances. Any movement, such as physical activity, may lead to motion artefacts that corrupt the PPG signal and limit the measurement accuracy of physiological parameters. Pressure disturbances acting on the probe, such as the contact force between the PPG sensor and measurement site, can also deform the arterial geometry by compression. Thus, in the reflected PPG signal, the AC amplitude may be influenced by the pressure exerted on the skin (Challoner and Ramsay, 1974; Hertzman and Roth, 1942; Jespersen and Pedersen, 1986; Nijboer et al., 1981).
5.4 Early and Recent History on the Origin of the PPG
The first report of using a similar technique was used for continuous recording of peripheral circulatory changes in the rabbit ear following venous occlusion. It also described the recordings obtained from the skin of the human fingers using a reflection mode PPG system (Molitor and Knalzuk, 1936).
Hertzman’s early work describes the use of reflection mode to establish a valid method for measuring blood flow and blood volume changes. Later, the AC and DC components of the signals were separated using electronic amplifiers in order to monitor vasomotor activity. There were also attempts to use the signal for assessing the completeness of sympathectomy. However, the early researchers in this field were limited by the size, sensitivity, and reproducibility of the available technology (Hertzman, 1938; Hertzman and Roth, 1942, 1942).
In the 1960‘s, accompanying the evolution of semiconductor technology, further investigations took place. There were attempts to detect the onset of cutaneous vasodilation using PPG (Challoner and Ramsay, 1974; D’Agrosa and Hertzman, 1967) More recently PPG has been widely used with the introduction of pulse oximetry as a non‐invasive method for monitoring patient’s blood oxygen saturation (Aoyagi, 2003; Sinex, 1999).
Several researchers have investigated the optical processes in relation to PPG signal. They have highlighted the key factors that can affect the amount of light received by the photodetector; these factors include the sensor configuration, blood volume changes, blood vessel wall movement and the orientation of red blood cells (RBC).
For almost a century, quantification of haemodynamic measurements with the PPG has rested upon the assumption that the PD output could be considered a linear function of intravascular volume, and this assumption might be acceptable for the minute volume changes detected as a consequence of normal arterial pulsation in the microcirculation.

95

Chapter 5

Photoplethysmography

However, previously obtained results indicated that PPG output depends logarithmically on the behaviour of the erythrocytes during blood circulation, and thus compliance studies which imply much larger alterations of vascular volume will be invalidated if this relationship is not taken into account. Hence, this confirms once again the challenges of quantitative PPG measurements (Björn, 2007; de Trafford and Lafferty, 1984; Jespersen and Pedersen, 1986; Shelley, 2007).
Some of the experimental set‐ups suggested that the alternating PPG signal was reacting to the orientation of the RBC during the cardiac cycle, instead of volumetric changes (D’Agrosa and Hertzman, 1967), also, it has been pointed out that changes in the blood distribution between the vascular areas can play a role in signal generation (Hocherman and Palti, 1967). Literature reports can be reconciled with the view that scattering and absorption of light by blood‐filled vessels have major effects on the PPG signal (Nijboer et al., 1981).
The PPG signal still leaves an open question of what does it actually measure. Attempts to quantify the pulse amplitude have been unsuccessful. The orientation effect of erythrocytes has been demonstrated by recording pulsatile waveforms in a glass tube where volumetric changes should not be possible (Jespersen and Pedersen, 1986). However, the role of erythrocyte orientation and the mechanism it contributes to the generation of the PPG waveform is not fully understood (Anderson and Parrish, 1981; Nielsen et al., 2008; Nijboer et al., 1981; Ochoa and Ohara, 1980; Rolfe, 1979).
The difference in PPG pulse amplitude between two locations (forehead and finger) noted in Mannheimer’s experiment (Mannheimer, 2007), highlights an interesting and poorly understood aspect of Photoplethysmography, imposing a simple but rather a difficult question to answer; where does the optical “pulse” actually come from? A pragmatic answer is that the magnitude of the light intensity comes directly from the modulating change in tissue opacity and hence, optical density. However, the question of what are the major factors that alter tissue opacity is not fully understood.
More recently, a technique termed Blood Pulsation Imaging (BPI) became visible in the literature, as a non‐invasive optical method based on PPG used for the visualisation of changes in the spatial distribution of blood in the microvascular bed. The method is based on the detection of time‐varying modulation of each pixel in the recorded video frames synchronously with the heartbeats. One of the BPI studies highlighted an observation of the presence of two inverted signals in adjacent locations (Teplov et al.,

96

Chapter 5

Photoplethysmography

2014). Another recent study highlighted the importance of arterial stiffness in the origination of the PPG signal using BPI (Kamshilin et al., 2015). The study suggests that elastic deformation of the dermis caused by transmural arterial pressure changes plays a key role in the formation of the PPG waveform when subject’s skin is illuminated by light with small penetration length (510‐560 nm). At deeper penetrating depths or longer wavelengths, the influence of the dermis compression is diminished because of the efficient interaction of the light with varying blood volume inside pulsating arteries (Kamshilin et al., 2015).
Finally, we conclude some of the factors that have been noted to affect the PPG waveform which can be summarised as:
1. The periodic increase and decrease in the tissue blood fraction. 2. The degree of cutaneous vessel distensibility. 3. The spacing between the emitter and detector (wider separations associated with
larger measured pulse amplitudes) and the depth of the pulsing vasculature. 4. The extinction coefficient of the modulating blood volume at the measurement
wavelength. 5. The volumetric and flow‐dependent blood‐scattering contributions from the
erythrocytes in the blood 6. Venous pulsations, direct from the right heart or indirectly from adjacent
arteries. 7. The autonomic function and the role of vasoconstriction and vasodilation and the
concentrations of the chemical release associated with both mechanisms.
5.5 PPG Applications
PPG has been applied in many different clinical settings, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment, and autonomic function. Some of these applications are discussed briefly in this section.
5.5.1 Blood Oxygen Saturation
Pulse Oximetry has been one of the most significant technological advances in clinical patient monitoring over the last few decades (Webster, 1997). It utilises PPG measurements to obtain information about the arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Some of the main areas in which pulse oximeters are used include anaesthesia, fetal monitoring, neonatal and paediatric care, dentistry and oral surgery, and sleep studies (Kyriacou, 2013, 2006; May et al., 2014; Zaman et al., 2013). In the early 1990’s, pulse

97

Chapter 5

Photoplethysmography

oximetry became a mandated international standard for monitoring during anaesthesia following the publication of the Harvard minimum standards for monitoring in 1986. It is considered as a necessary monitoring technique for the continuous monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in patients under anaesthesia and the determination of desaturation events (Chan et al., 2007).
The technique utilises red and infrared PPG signals to indicate oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin in the blood. The AC and DC components are derived at each wavelength and a ratio of AC over DC is obtained which compensates for changes in incident light intensity, removing a complicated variable from the equation. Performing this operation at each wavelength is capable of isolating the relative absorbance of reduced and oxygenated Hb. The ratio of the red signal (AC660nm/DC660nm) to the infrared signal (AC940nm/DC940nm) reflects a similar ratio of reduced to oxygenated Hb, which can be then converted to oxygen saturation using calibration curves.
5.5.2 Blood Pressure
Arterial blood pressure is a very important clinical variable to measure. The measurement of the arterial pressure waveform at the finger with a continuous beat‐by‐beat basis was introduced in the early 1980s. The method is based on the dynamic (pulsatile) vascular unloading of the finger arterial walls using an inflatable finger cuff with built‐in PPG sensor. Blood pressure was also estimated using an algorithm based on the pulse arrival time and was compared with conventional arm blood pressure measurements. Their approach showed promise as a method for home monitoring of blood pressure. Using empirically determined transfer functions, it is possible to derive the arterial blood pressure pulse from PPG measurements (Asif‐Ul‐Hoque et al., 2011). The various methods and limitations of these methods were further discussed previously in Chapter 3.
5.5.3 Arterial Stiffness
Arterial stiffness is recognised as a vital indicator of cardiovascular health at an early stage of atherosclerosis. PPG was used to derive a host of indices for empirical estimation of arterial stiffness. The stiffness index, the augmentation index, Pulse wave velocity using the AC component of the PPG signal or its second derivative. These methods and their applicability and limitations for estimation of arterial stiffness using PPG were further discussed previously in Chapter 3.

Photoplethysmography

5.5.4 Respiration
Respiration causes variation in the peripheral circulation, making it possible to monitor breathing using a PPG sensor attached to the skin. The low frequency respiratory induced intensity variations in the PPG signal are well documented (Johansson and Öberg, 1999; Nakajima et al., 1996) These variations are not fully understood but is believed to be caused by skin blood volume fluctuations induced by the respiratory variations in intrathoracic pressure transmitted to the measurement site by the venous system (Meredith et al., 2012).
5.5.5 Vascular Assessment
Disease detection with PPG is possible because the peripheral pulse usually becomes damped, delayed and diminished with increasing severity of some vascular diseases, particularly peripheral arterial disease (Bortolotto et al., 2000). Multi‐body site PPG measurements have been proposed for peripheral vascular disease detection. It was also documented that PPG technique can be used to detect endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients using the PPG‐derived reflection index (Chowienczyk et al., 1999).
PPG pulse shape was also used to characterise healthy subjects and Raynaud’s patients and found that both the pulse amplitude and the slope of the rising edge were good markers for the condition. The DC component of the PPG waveform was also used for the noninvasive assessment of lower limb chronic venous insufficiency (Cooke et al., 1985).
5.5.6 Autonomic Function
The PPG signal is composite in nature and has low‐frequency components relating to respiration, blood pressure control, and thermoregulation, as well as the high‐frequency components relating to the heart synchronous pulse waveform. Meanwhile, PPG shows considerable potential for neurological assessment, with the capability to give new insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The PPG signal could provide basic information about heart rate (HR) and its variability, and highly suggests a good alternative to understanding dynamics pertaining to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) without the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) device (K. Hamunen et al., 2012).
5.5.7 Other Clinical Parameters
The stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out of a ventricle during one ventricular contraction) can be estimated from PPG‐derived pulse contour analysis on a beat‐by‐beat
