What is HRV
Regulation of heart rate

Autonomic nervous system (ANS)
▪ To preserve blood pressure homeostasis, ANS regulates
 Heart rate and cardiac function  Vasomotor activity  Arterial baroreflex
▪ ANS divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic branches

HRV time series
▪ Continuous regulation of heart rate (HR)  Heart rate variability (HRV)
▪ Sympathetic activity (GAS)
 Increases HR and decreases HRV
▪ Parasympathetic activity (BRAKE)
Decreases HR and increases HRV
▪ Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)
▪ High HRV indicates good recovery and high ability to tolerate stress

HRV Analysis Methods
▪ Time-domain (Mean RR, SDNN, RMSSD etc.)
 Intensity of HRV
▪ Frequency-domain (LF and HF components, LF/HF ratio etc.)
 Frequency components of HRV (assessment of sympathovagal balance)
▪ Nonlinear (Entropy measures etc.)
 Complexity of HRV
▪ Time-varying
 HRV dynamics

Applications of HRV

Medical Research

Stress and Wellbeing

Fitness and Exercise

• Risk evaluation after MI • Evaluation of heart failure • Marker of diabetic neuropathy • Evaluation of CAD • ANS testing • Sleep apnea • Affective disorders • Anesthesia monitoring etc.

• Occupational stress • HRV Biofeedback • Resonant frequency • Physiotherapy, yoga etc.

• Fitness assessment  maxHR, anaerobic threshold, energy consumption
• Recovery monitoring  Avoiding overtraining
• Coaching  HRV based individualized training prescription

How we use MATLAB
How it all started?
▪ MATLAB 4.2 and 5 (1994-1999)
▪ MSc studies in Medical Physics ▪ Used in many courses for practical
works and exercises
▪ MATLAB 6, 7 and 8 (2000-2014)
▪ PhD research in Medical Signal Analysis
▪ Development of HRV analysis software started
 Ver. 1.1 released in Sep 2002

Still relying on MATLAB
1. Optimal for algorithm development and testing
Example: Signal baseline fitting
N = length(z); lambda = 500; I = speye(N); D2 = spdiags(ones(N-2,1)*[1 -2 1],[0:2],N-2,N); z_stat = (I-inv(I+lambda^2*D2’*D2))*z;

2. Graphics
MATLAB figure ✓ uimenu and toolbar ✓ 2D & 3D visualisations ✓ Highly customizable controls for
GUI design ✓ Mouse/keyboard interactions
MATLAB UI figure (App designer) ✓ Interesting, but still some
limitations (mouse/keyboard interaction, UImenu support)

3. Fast to build applications
MATLAB Compiler ✓Matlab code  Windows,
macOS and Linux applications ✓deploytool – easy to use, but
we need to customize our installers ✓Code signing ✓ Agile software development
