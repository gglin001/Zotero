Title 	Combinational photoplethysmography based model for blood pressure measurement
Author(s) 	Nye, R
Year 	2018
Abstract 	Blood pressure (BP) is an important and commonly used vital sign to monitor a patient’s health. Current methods for monitor blood pressure are unsuitable for continuous, uninterrupted measurement of blood pressure outside of a hospital setting as such methods are invasive and could pose risks if complications occur. This research has investigated the possibility of using two photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to monitor a patient’s pulse at two sites; the ear and the finger. Through the use of these two simultaneous and continuous measurements the ultimate aim is develop a method of continous non-invasive blood pressure (CNIBP) monitoring.
