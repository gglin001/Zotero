This repository contains the HRV toolbox (Python package) developed within the scope of my master thesis "Development of an Open-Source Python Toolbox for Heart Rate Variability (HRV)" ).

The HRV algorithms have been developed and implemented according to the Heart Rate Variability - Sandards of Measurement, Physiological Interpretation, and Clinical Use guidelines and other references which are notes in the code itself (will be entirely updated soon).

Below follows as list of the parameters and features. Major updates will be listed in the changelog .

    IMPORTANT: pyHRV had some installation issues under Python3 which have been fixed in v.0.3.2

Getting Started
Installation

This toolbox can be installed using the pip tool (works for Python 2 and 3):

 pip install pyhrv

    NOTE: Python 3 installation issues using pip install have now been fixed with v.0.3.2

Documentation & Tutorials

An overview of all the available functions and short quickstart tutorials can be found in the README file found within the pyhrv package.

The official pyHRV Documentation is now available on ReadTheDocs:

https://pyhrv.readthedocs.io
HRV Parameter List

The following HRV parameters can be computed with this toolbox.

(NNI: Normal-to-Normal Interval, HR: Heart Rate, SD: Standard deviation, PSD: Power Spectral Density)
Time Domain Parameters

    Basic statistical parameters of an NNI series (min, max, mean)
    Basic statistical parameters of an NNI differences series (min, max, mean, max difference)
    Basic statistical parameters of an HR series (min, max, mean, SD)
    Standard Deviation of NNI (SDNN)
    Mean of the SD of 5min segments (SDNN Index)
    SD of the Mean of 5min segments (SDANN)
    Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD)
    SD of Successive Differences (SDSD)
    NN50 (NNI > 50ms) and pNN50 (% of NNI > 50ms)
    NNX (NNI > Xms) and pNN50 (% of NNI > Xms)
    Triangular Index
    Baseline Width of the Histogram based on Triangular Interpolation (TINN) (TINN, N, M)

Frequency Domain Parameters

Computes the following PSD parameters from the Welch's Method and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (with default or custom frequency bands):

    Peak Frequencies
    Absolute Powers
    Logarithmic Powers
    Relative Powers
    Normalized Powers (LF and HF only)
    LF/HF ratio

Nonlinear Parameters

    Poincaré Plot (SD1, SD2, fittes ellipse area, SD2/SD1 ratio)
    Sample Entropy
    Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (short-term and long-term)

Additional HRV Tools

    Computation of NNI series
    Computation of ∆NNI series
    Computation of HR series
    Signal segmentation
    ECG plotting on medical-grade-like ECG paper layout
    Tachogram plotting
    HRV report generation (.txt and .csv format)
    HRV result exportation and importion (.json format)

Context of this Work

This package has initially been developed within the scope of my master thesis "Development of an Open-Source Python Toolbox for Heart Rate Variability (HRV)" at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg, Germany (Faculty Life Sciences, Department of Biomedical Engineering) and PLUX wireless biosignals, S.A. , Lisbon, Portugal.
Other Support Packages Developed within the Skope of this Work
OpenSignalsReader

Python package to read OpenSignals (r)evolution files and automatic sensor data conversion for BITalino (r)evolution sensor data.

This package has been developed to facilitate the import of ECG sensor data acquired with BITalino (r)evolution to conduct HRV analysis.

Visit the repository for more detailed information:

https://github.com/PGomes92/opensignalsreader

( OpenSignals (r)evolution (by PLUX wireless biosignals S.A. ) is the official software for the BITalino and biosignalsplux biosignal acquisition platforms. )
KUBIOS

Python package to export NN/RR interval series in KUBIOS HRV readable format and to import HRV results from KUBIOS report files in .txt format.

Visit the repository for more detailed information:

https://github.com/PGomes92/kubios
