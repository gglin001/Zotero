Preface
Heart rate variability is the study of autonomic nervous activity through the information provided by ﬂuctuations in heart rate. Autonomic activity is responsible for regulating heart rate. By studying the beat-to-beat variability in the intervals between heartbeats, it is possible to form a representation of autonomic nervous activity. Alterations in this activity can thus be quantitatively measured with a noninvasive technique. Accordingly, heart rate variability has become a very active ﬁeld of research and the most popular biological signal by which the autonomic nervous system is studied. Heart rate variability can measure the individual levels of parasympathetic and sympathetic modulation of heart rate, and from this information one can make predictions on the state of the autonomic nervous system. Moreover, a deeper exploration of the physiological basis of the autonomic nervous system can be investigated.
The study of the autonomic nervous system from the information contained in heart rate relies upon mathematical models and techniques and the power of digital computers to achieve reliable and accurate results. In the past only simplistic mathematical techniques have been brought to bear due to the limited ability of clinical investigators in this regard. Recently, mathematicians, physicists and engineers have worked alongside cardiologists and physiologists to develop sophisticated models and mathematical techniques for the analysis of heart rate data. The development of more accurate models of heart rate variability and robust analysis techniques that are immune to the large levels of noise and artefact found in all biological signals is an active ﬁeld of research currently. Advances in this area have direct beneﬁts to clinical and physiological studies that employ heart rate variability to study disease and physiology.
Many of the mathematical techniques are only approximations and have defects that are not obvious except when analysed carefully with a mathematical formulation. Mathematical analysis allows one to investigate the limitations of analysis techniques. Further, the full potential of the analysis techniques is often only revealed by a full mathematical treatment. The theoretical study of models of the autonomic system has similar characteristics, with the limitations and full descriptive power of a model being largely unknown until studied mathematically.

Preface

The study of models also allows the development of optimal analysis techniques. Many of the mathematical algorithms and models applied in HRV analysis remain uninvestigated. The problem is, how do we quantitatively characterize (linear and/ or nonlinear) the heart rate time series to capture useful summary descriptions that are independent of existing HRV measures? Recent research on HRV has proven that Poincare´ plot analysis (PPA) is a powerful tool to mark short-term and longterm HRV. Researchers have investigated a number of techniques: converting the two-dimensional plot into various one-dimensional views; the ﬁtting of an ellipse to the plot shape; and measuring the correlation coefﬁcient of the plot. In fact, they are all measuring linear aspects of the intervals which existing HRV indices already specify. The fact that these methods appear insensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the intervals is an important ﬁnding because the Poincare´ plot is primarily a nonlinear technique. This result motivates the search for better methods for Poincare´ plot quantiﬁcation. This provides the motivation for this book.
Chapter 1 gives an overview of the physiological concepts and necessary background in the ﬁeld of heart rate variability, including the history, physiology, analysis techniques and the clinical signiﬁcance of the ﬁeld. This includes models of heart rate variability and the mathematical signals employed to characterize heart rate variability. Details of the time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of these signals are also covered.
Chapter 2 provides a mathematical analysis of a common heart rate variability technique known as the Poincare´ plot. The Poincare´ plot is an emerging analysis technique that takes a sequence of intervals between heartbeats and plots each interval against the following interval. The geometry of this plot has been shown to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy subjects in clinical settings by employing trained specialists to visually classify the plots. The Poincare´ plot is a valuable HRV analysis technique due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the interval sequence. In particular we investigate the question of whether existing measures of Poincare´ plot geometry reﬂect nonlinear features of heart rate variability. We show that methods of Poincare´ quantiﬁcation that summarize the geometrical distribution of the points with “moment-like” calculations, i.e. means and standard deviations, etc., are unlikely to be independent of existing linear measures of heart rate variability.
Chapter 3 of the book investigates Poincare´ plot interpretation using a new oscillator model of heart rate variability. This chapter develops a physiologically plausible mathematical model of autonomic nervous control of heart rate based on a series of well-studied oscillations in heart rate. By employing the results described, the time series of intervals between heartbeats are able to be analytically determined. The properties of the Poincare´ plot can then be derived. By analysing the Poincare´ plot in terms of an underlying model of HRV, the theoretical basis of Poincare´ plot morphology can be precisely related back to the model and therefore back to the physiological causes. This provides a deeper understanding of the Poincare´ plot than has previously been possible. To validate the model, simulations of various autonomic conditions are compared to HRV data obtained from subjects under the prescribed conditions. For a variety of autonomic balances, the model generates

Poincare´ plots that undergo morphological alterations strongly resembling those of actual heartbeat intervals.
Poincare´ plot is valuable due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the data sequence. However, the problem lies in capturing temporal information of the plot quantitatively. The standard descriptors used in quantifying the Poincare´ plot (SD1, SD2) measure the gross variability of the time series data. Determination of advanced methods for capturing temporal properties poses a signiﬁcant challenge. Chapter 4 proposes a novel descriptor “Complex Correlation Measure (CCM)” to quantify the temporal aspect of the Poincare´ plot. In contrast to SD1 and SD2, the CCM incorporates point-to-point variation of the signal.
The asymmetry in heart rate variability is a visibly obvious phenomenon in the Poincare´ plot of normal sinus rhythm. It shows the unevenness in the distribution of points above and below the line of identity, which indicates instantaneous changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate. The major limitation of the existing asymmetry deﬁnition is that it considers only the instantaneous changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate rather than the pattern (increase/decrease). Chapter 5 describes a novel deﬁnition of asymmetry considering the geometry of a 2D Poincare´ plot. Based on the proposed deﬁnition, traditional asymmetry indices—Guzik’s index (GI), Porta’s index (PI) and Ehlers’ index (EI)—have been redeﬁned.
Chapter 6 of the book considers the segmented aspects of Poincare´ plot remaining, on the one hand, the nonlinear properties of the system and, on the other hand, providing high resolution information about the time course and time correlations within a heart rate time series. These new approaches were successfully introduced in risk stratiﬁcation.
This book should be of considerable help to researchers, professionals in medical device industries, academics and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines. The text provides a comprehensive account of recent research in this emerging ﬁeld and we anticipate that the concepts presented here will generate further research in this ﬁeld.

Chapter 1
Introduction

Abstract The study of heart rate variability (HRV) focuses on the analysis of beat-to-beat ﬂuctuations in heart rate and the diagnostic ability that these ﬂuctuations provide. The series of time intervals between heartbeats, referred to as RR intervals, are measured over a period of anywhere from 10 min to 24 h and form the most commonly studied HRV time series (Rompelman et al., Med. Biol. Eng. Comput. 15(3):233–239, 1977). The great majority of variability witnessed in heart rate records is due to the autonomic nervous system modulating heart rate (Jalife and Michaels, Vagal Control of the Heart: Experimental Basis and Clinical Implications, ed. by Levy and Schwartz, Futura, New York, 1994, pp. 173–205). Accordingly, attention has focused on HRV as a method of quantifying cardiac autonomic function. Vagal tone is the dominant inﬂuence under resting conditions and the majority of heart rate ﬂuctuations are a result of vagal modulation (Chess et al., Am. J. Physiol. 228:775–780, 1975). This provides clinicians with a reliable, non-invasive technique to monitor parasympathetic nervous activity. This, and other information that can be derived from HRV records, is of great importance to clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment and study of many illnesses related to the cardiovascular and autonomic systems.

1 Introduction

Fig. 1.1 The RR intervals are constructed from the intervals between successive R waves
modulation [3]. This provides clinicians with a reliable, non-invasive technique to monitor parasympathetic nervous activity. This, and other information that can be derived from HRV records, is of great importance to clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment and study of many illnesses related to the cardiovascular and autonomic systems.
1.1.1 The RR Intervals
In HRV, an ECG recording is taken and processed to locate the times of the heartbeats. This is done by locating the R waves in the ECG recordings, as they are the largest deﬂection and the wave that is able to be most precisely located. The times between successive R waves, the so-called RR intervals, is the time series that is a result of this process. Figure 1.1 details the construction of the RR intervals from the ECG. Short-term recordings or long-term recording of ECG can be made. Short-term recordings are usually at least 5 min long, but not substantially longer so as to guarantee stationarity. Long-term recordings are usually made for 24 h using a portable Holter recording device. Subjects who are healthy generally exhibit a large degree of variability in the RR interval records. This is due to the active operation of various control loops governing HRV. Subjects who are diseased tend to have reduced HRV. This may be a consequence of sections (or all) of the systems regulating heart rate being damaged. It might also be due to an alteration in autonomic nervous behaviour secondary to the effects of a disease not directly affecting the cardiovascular system. Figure 1.2 shows two example of RR interval records. The ﬁrst (Fig. 1.2a) is of a healthy individual and a substantial degree of variability is present, including high- and low-frequency variability. The second (Fig. 1.2b) record is of heart failure subject who has suffered considerable damage to the parasympathetic nervous system. The level of variability in this record is much less than the healthy subject. The lack of variability is primarily of the highfrequency variety as would be expected for degraded parasympathetic function (parasympathetic control is the only quick-acting modulator of heart rate).
HRV analysis’ primary purpose is to assess the function of the nervous system. It is speciﬁcally not interested in determining whether the heart, as an individual

unit, produces normal sinus beats. Analysing the ECG directly best assesses problems with beat formation. HRV analysis assumes that each individual heartbeat is a normal heartbeat with a normal ECG signature. In other words, RR interval records should only contain heartbeats that were generated under sinus origin. This is known as being in “sinus rhythm”. The autonomic nervous system directly controls the sinus nodes rate of ﬁring. When an ectopic pacemaker controls the heart, the RR interval series don’t contain any information on the function of the nervous system. In summary, HRV assesses the hearts rhythm, not how the heart actually forms a beat.
1.2 History of Heart Rate Variability
Since ancient times, it has been known that there exists considerable variability in heart rate even when the body is at rest. The fact that respiration was involved in generating the heart rate ﬂuctuations was well known, even in very early times, because it causes easily noticeable short-term heart rate ﬂuctuations. In 1733, Steven Hales was able to report that beat-to-beat HRV was synchronous with respiration [4]. Even though this cause and effect relationship was established, it took until much later for this fact to be put to a clinical use. That time came with the advent of the digital computer, which allowed long-term heart rate records to be collected and analysed. In 1965 Hon and Lee reported that heart rate patterns during foetal distress altered signiﬁcantly earlier than did mean heart rate [5]. Bedside tests derived from short-term RR intervals were developed by Ewing to detect diabetic neuropathy [6]. Both these works were based on the known effects of respiration on heart rate. The next major development came as it was being realized that the rhythms in heart rate were more complicated than just respiration. The early 1970s saw a concentration of work describing the physiological rhythms embedded in the heart rate signal, including vasomotor activity, thermal regulation

and respiration [7–10]. In 1977 Wolf et al. showed that those with reduced HRV were at higher risk of postinfarction mortality [11]. In other words, patients who have survived a heart attack, but with little to no HRV, were in a high-risk category for low survival probability. Akselrod et al. used power spectral analysis to quantitatively evaluate cardiovascular control in 1981 [12]. The signiﬁcance of this result was that heart rate records could be decomposed into separate signals that represented the operation of the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system. The emergence of spectral analysis allowed the autonomic basis of HRV to be explored [13, 14]. In the late 1980s the importance of HRV analysis became appreciated when it was shown to be a strong independent predictor of mortality after acute myocardial infarction [15–17]. As heart attack is a major problem in today’s society, this result was received with much enthusiasm, as HRV is a cheap, non-invasive technique that could lead to signiﬁcantly better health care and recovery management. Lately, with the development of nonlinear mathematics and chaos theory, it has come to light that HRV signals appear to have much in common with chaotic time series. Much has been made of this, and the various statistics used to characterize chaotic time series have been applied to HRV classiﬁcation [18–20]. These results are not yet convincing, but the hope is that nonlinear dynamics may be able to unravel the high-level operation of the cardiovascular system, which is known to be a nonlinear system.
HRV is becoming a valuable tool for the clinician. Many studies have been done on the use of HRV as an indicator of disease, and an index of risk for sudden death. A brief outline of some of the major ﬁndings is as follows:
Myocardial Infarction: Myocardial infarction or “heart attack” is the death of tissue comprising the walls of the heart chambers (the myocardium). This usually occurs from lack of oxygen (ischaemia) due to low levels of blood ﬂow to the heart. Myocardial ischemia caused by coronary occlusion has been shown to be accompanied by excited sympathetic activity [21]. Autonomic activity has been shown to be closely related to susceptibility to ventricular ﬁbrillation [22]. In general, increased sympathetic activity was found to predispose to malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and increased parasympathetic activity provided a protective and antiﬁbrillatory effect [23]. These ﬁndings have provided the impetus to study the use of HRV as a non-invasive tool to evaluate alterations of autonomic control in patients following myocardial infarction [24–34].
Risk Stratiﬁcation Postinfarction: Risk stratiﬁcation is designed for early identiﬁcation of the patient at high risk for complications. The aim is to implement appropriate prophylactic therapy to prevent re-infarction or sudden death. Of deaths following infarction, 75% are due to an arrhythmic mechanism and the remainder are due to myocardial pump failure [35]. HRV is a very useful prognostic index, probably because it reﬂects reduced vagal and increased sympathetic activity [16, 36]. A recent major study has shown that reduced 24 h SDRR is a powerful independent predictor of cardiac events following arrhythmic myocardial infarction [37].

1.3 Physiological Basis of HRV Analysis

Hypertension: Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. Several functional alterations of the cardiovascular system are frequently found in hypertensive patients. These alterations may increase their risk beyond that induced by elevated blood pressure alone. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is a swelling of the left ventricle, secondary to hypertension, is one such example. Reduced high-frequency HRV has been shown to correlate with LVH and a worse prognosis after arrhythmic myocardial infarction [38].
Diabetes: Diabetes can cause severe autonomic dysfunction that can be responsible for several disabling symptoms, including sudden cardiac death (SCD) [39]. Although traditional measures of autonomic function are able to document the presence of neuropathy, in general they are only abnormal when there is severe symptomatology. Thus, by the time changes in function are evident, the natural course of autonomic neuropathy is well established. HRV analysis is able to detect the change in autonomic balance before neuropathy is established [40].
Sudden Cardiac Death: Ventricular tachyarrhythmias represent a leading cause of SCD in the community [34, 41]. The study by Farrell et al. [42] reported that decreased HRV was more predictive of subsequent arrhythmic events than the presence of late potentials (Holter-derived arrhythmias treadmill exercise test results or left ventricular ejection fraction). In multivariate analysis of combinations of risk factors, the combination of late potentials recorded by the signal averaged ECG and reduced HRV was more predictive than any other combination.
Coronary Artery Disease: Studies using short-term measures of HRV demonstrated an inverse relationship between cholesterol and vagal activity [43]. This raises the possibility that a high cholesterol level may directly or indirectly inﬂuence cardiac autonomic tone.
Heart Failure: Conﬂicting evidence as to the correlation between the degree of myocardial damage sustained following a myocardial infarction and HRV in humans [44, 45]. In patients with heart failure, one study showed a signiﬁcant linear correlation between HRV and ejection fraction [46] while others have not [45].
Smoking and Alcohol: Smokers have increased sympathetic and reduced vagal activity as measured by HRV analysis [47]. HRV is reduced following ingestion of alcohol suggesting sympathetic activation and/or parasympathetic withdrawal [48]. Malapas et al. [49] have demonstrated vagal neuropathy in men with chronic alcohol dependence using 24 h HRV analysis.

1.3 Physiological Basis of HRV Analysis
Several physiological rhythms modulate heart rate via the autonomic nervous system. Instantaneous heart rate represents the total summation of all the effects on the autonomic nervous system. In the normal healthy subject there are several reﬂexes that operate in a simultaneous manner. These reﬂexes contain rhythms that

6

1 Introduction

Fig. 1.3 The process which generates vasomotor oscillations
are transmitted to the cardioregulatory systems in the brain and are effected in heart rate. The correspondence between these rhythms and branches of autonomic nervous system allows HRV analysis to provide information on the function of the different sections of the autonomic nervous system.
Respiration: Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) refers to the clinical variation in heart rate associated with breathing. Breathing causes disturbances in blood pressure, which are sensed by the baroreceptors. The baroreﬂex arc processes the changes in blood pressure and causes a corresponding ﬂuctuation in heart rate [8]. Because respiration is roughly periodic with a relatively short period (about 3 s), the ﬂuctuations are mediated solely by the parasympathetic nervous system. As a result, parasympathetic control is able to operate on a rapid time scale, whereas the sympathetic systems cannot. Some researchers believe that the magnitude of sinus arrhythmia provides an index of the level of cardiac vagal activity [50, 51]. RSA also relies on the baroreceptor reﬂex to operate and therefore assess the functioning of the baroreceptor reﬂexes. Whether RSA indicates the entire level of parasympathetic activity or only the modulatory portion thereof is a matter that is under some debate [52].
Vasomotor Oscillations: Vasomotor oscillations are a low-frequency spontaneous oscillation in blood pressure with a period of roughly 10 s. Constricting of the cross-sectional area of the arteries via smooth muscle activation regulates blood ﬂow to different regions of the body. This process is controlled in a nonlinear manner by the brain stem and the baroreceptors. Due to delays in the processing system and the properties of smooth muscle activation, a spontaneous oscillation of roughly 10 Hz appears in blood pressure. This oscillation is detected by the baroreceptors and is superimposed onto the heart rate by the baroreceptor reﬂex arc [8]. Figure 1.3 shows the process diagrammatically. Vasomotor oscillations are mediated by the sympathetic nervous system [12, 53, 54]. There is debate

1.3 Physiological Basis of HRV Analysis

Fig. 1.4 The cardiovascular control system as a feedback control system
about whether they are also mediated by the parasympathetic system [52,55] and at this stage the results are inconclusive. This is a gap in the knowledge of how the sympathetic nervous system affects heart rate and requires further research. Sympathetic-Vagal Interactions: There is usually a balance between both divisions of the autonomic nervous system with heart rate reﬂecting the net effect of the two opposing arms of the system. At rest the vagal system is dominant; however with increasing levels of activity the activity of the vagus decreases and the sympathetic increases. However, although heart rate reﬂects the combined activity of both arms of the autonomic nervous system, it cannot be used to gauge the individual effect of the vagal or sympathetic system. It has been shown that the activity of the vagus nerve is accentuated when heart rate has been accelerated by sympathetic stimulation [56]. Heart Rate Control: Short-term heart rate control can be considered as a control system where the physiological system is broken down into the following components:
• Cardiovascular system: the plant • Cardioregulatory system: the controller • Autonomic nervous system: control inputs/outputs • Vasomotor and respiration: disturbances
Figure 1.4 shows these components as a feedback control system. The disturbances in blood pressure are transmitted via the autonomic nervous system to the controller, which causes sympathetic and parasympathetic activity to ﬂuctuate in rhythm. The ﬂuctuations in blood pressure are therefore seen in heart rate also.

1.4 Analysis Methods

1 Introduction

The HRV indices can be divided into three major categories: time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear. The time-domain indices were developed quite early in the ﬁeld and are still very popular. The frequency-domain indices were developed later and allow the variability to be divided into separate rhythms based on frequency. The nonlinear methods are based on the premise that HRV is a chaotic time series. They are the latest development and a very active ﬁeld at present. To emphasize that edited RR intervals are being analysed, often the RR intervals are quoted as NN intervals. The NN intervals are the normal-to-normal intervals that result from editing ectopic beats and noise from the RR intervals. Either short-term or long-term recordings are analysed.

1.4.1 Time Domain
The time-domain indices of HRV measure the statistical properties of RR intervals, or the delta RR intervals. The delta RR intervals are the series of differences between successive RR intervals. The most common class of time-domain indices are based on statistical measurements of the intervals. Various “geometric” methods also exist, in which various measurements are made of the geometry of patterns made by the intervals. First we describe the most popular statistical techniques.
1.4.1.1 Statistical Techniques
The statistical techniques are based on various moments of the RR intervals and the delta RR intervals:
SDRR The standard deviation of the RR intervals. This is a measure of total variability of the RR intervals. Low values indicate practically no HRV and this property alone has made it possibly the most used index in the literature [57–68]. SDRR increases as the length of time the measurement is taken over increases. It is able to be used for both long-term and short-term recordings, although it is not advised for use on short-term recordings due to dubious reproducibility [55]. Normal subjects have a value of 141+/−39 ms (mean +/− standard deviation) for long-term recordings [55].
SDARR The standard deviation of the means of short-term (5 min) recordings. This is a measure of variability with period over 5 min. This measure is obviously only appropriate for long-term HRV measurements and is usually performed on 24 h records [69–74]. Normal subjects have a value of 127+/−35 ms [55].

1.4 Analysis Methods

RMSSD Root mean square of the successive differences of the RR intervals. This is a measure of short-term HRV. It is also given the name SDSD, which stands for standard deviation of successive differences. The measure is best used on long-term recordings, but is often employed for short-term recordings. It is the most common time-domain measure of short-term HRV [29, 69, 75–80]. Normal subjects have an RMSSD value of 27+/−12 ms [55]. As short-term variability is mediated purely by the parasympathetic system, RMSSD measures parasympathetic modulation of heart rate.
NN50 The number of interval differences of successive NN intervals that are greater than 50 ms. This is a measure of short-term HRV. This measure correlates highly with RMSSD. NN50 measures parasympathetic modulation of heart rate. RMSSD has better immunity to ectopic beats and has nicer statistical properties, so it is the preferred measure of short-term HRV.
pNN50 The fraction of NN50 intervals as a proportion of the total number of NN intervals. This is another measure of short-term HRV. This measure correlates very highly with RMSSD . For the same reasons as NN50 RMSSD is a preferred method of measuring short-term HRV; however this measure is still quite often seen in the literature [40, 81–84].

1.4.1.2 Geometric Techniques
The geometric techniques convert the RR interval data into a geometric pattern. Various qualities of the shape or pattern are measured and form the HRV indices. The geometric techniques generally have better performance on poorly edited data. The most popular techniques are:
HRV Triangular Index: First the sample density histogram is constructed. The most frequent RR interval length is established and denoted by where is the most frequent RR interval length. The triangular index is given by dividing the total number of RR intervals by the most frequent RR interval length. The HRV triangular index has a value of 37+/−15 in normal subjects. It is a measure of total HRV, but it takes into account long-term ﬂuctuations more than the shortterm [17].
Poincare´ Plot: The Poincare´ plot is a scatter plot of the RR intervals against the next RR interval. The plot resembles a cloud oriented along the line of identity. The shape of the cloud provides a very useful description of HRV [85–93]. The length of the plot corresponds to the level of long-term variability and width of the plot measures short-term variability. Poincare´ width is considered a pure measure of parasympathetic activity [94]. Figure 1.5 displays a typical Poincare´ plot. Currently, Poincare´ plot analysis is a very active ﬁeld. The main problem with Poincare´ plot analysis is the lack of clear quantitative descriptions of the plot.

1.4.2 Frequency Domain
Many methods exist for estimating the spectrum from the RR intervals [1, 95–102]. The methods include both parametric and non-parametric techniques. While parametric methods obtain more accuracy on smaller data sets, the selection of model order can be difﬁcult to automate [55]. Spectral analysis of heart rate consists of ﬁrst calculating the power spectral density (PSD) of the RR intervals. Secondly, the PSD is broken into separate frequency bands as Fig. 1.5(a) details. Thirdly, the power in each band is calculated by integrating the PSD within the band limits. The bands are placed so as to measure useful information on the autonomic nervous system. The selection of the limits of each band has been standardized and depends on whether short-term or long-term recordings are being processed.

1.4.2.1 Short-Term Recordings
There are three main spectral components in a short-term recording of which only two are of physiological importance [8, 10, 12, 13, 53, 103]. They are:
• HF Power: high-frequency power (0.15–0.4 Hz). HF power is a measure of parasympathetic activity [12, 14, 53, 94]. The band is roughly centred on the average respiration frequency for a normal subject. For a normal subject, a peak in the PSD curve exists in this band at roughly 0.3 Hz caused by respiration .
• LF Power: low-frequency power (0.04–0.15 Hz). LF power is the subject of some controversy. Some consider it to be a measure of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities [54, 103, 104], while others consider it a pure measure

1.4 Analysis Methods

11

of sympathetic activity [12, 105]. For a normal subject, a peak exists in the LF band caused by vasomotor oscillations. The band is roughly centred on the frequency of the vasomotor oscillations, at roughly 0.1 Hz. • VLF Power: very-low-frequency power (0–0.04 Hz). VLF does not correlate with any known physiological rhythms. The VLF band is basically treated as noise and effects due to nonstationarity. No peaks are present in this band.
The total power TOT is given by VLF + HF + LF. The HF and LF components are often used to quantify the autonomic activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The balance between the two systems is often quantiﬁed by BAL = LF/HF. However, this quantity is interpreted differently by those who consider LF power to reﬂect sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. In this case LF/HF represents the sympathetic activity. Often researchers normalize the indices by dividing LF and HF by TOT. This gives more consistent results, especially when comparing subjects under different autonomic stresses.

1.4.2.2 Long-Term Recordings
Long-term recordings used for spectral analysis are usually 24 h recordings. An extra band is included for long-term recordings:
• HF: same as for short-term recordings. • LF: same as for short-term recordings. • VLF: very-low-frequency band (0.003–0.04 Hz). The VLF band only extends
down to 0.003 Hz. • ULF: ultra-low-frequency band (0–0.003 Hz). The ULF band is included for
long-term recordings.
The physiological mechanisms that generate the peaks in the HF and LF bands still produce peaks in long-term recordings. However, as the oscillations of these systems are not stationary over long periods of time, the modulations are averaged over the 24 h and detail is lost. Therefore, the use of LF and HF is not recommended for 24 h records. The LF and HF bands normally only account for 5% of the variability over 24 h. The physiological correlates of the VLF and ULF components are not well understood at present [55].

1.4.3 Nonlinear Dynamics
Considering the variety of factors inﬂuencing heart rate, e.g. respiration or mental load, it becomes apparent that heart rate regulation is one of the most complex systems in humans [106]. Many techniques suggested by nonlinear dynamics have been applied to the classiﬁcation of HRV. The application of these techniques is motivated by the fact that the control systems for HRV have been shown to be

12

1 Introduction

nonlinear [107–110] because of its high complexity and the nonlinear interactions between the physiological subsystems. Several of those indices have been proven to be of diagnostic relevance or have contributed to risk stratiﬁcation.
The following nonlinear methods/indices have been employed [106]:
• Fractal measures (e.g. power-law correlation, detrended ﬂuctuation analysis, multifractal analysis)
• Entropy measures (e.g. approximate entropy, sample entropy, compression entropy)
• Symbolic dynamics measures and ﬁnally • Poincare´ plot
Even if these methods may lead to new insights into HRV changes under various physiological and pathological conditions, the lacking standards of preprocessing the heart rate time series and calculating the different indices and in addition the problem of interpreting the physiological meanings of their indices prevented (yet) a major breakthrough in clinical and ambulatory care.
However, methods from nonlinear dynamics provide additional prognostic information and complement traditional time and frequency-domain analyses of HRV. In this context the Poincare´ plot analyses play a more and more important role and—as an advantage—are easier to understand and interpret and are (at least as simple plots) already widespread in Holter ECG analysis.

Quantitative Poincare´ Plot

Abstract Poincare´ plot is a geometrical representation of a time series in a Cartesian plane. Points of the plot are duplets of the values of the time series and the distance (in number of values) between values of each duplet is the lag of the plot. Statistically, lag-1 Poincare´ plot displays the correlation between consecutive samples in a graphical manner. It has been shown that Poincare´ plot reveals patterns of heart rate dynamics resulting from nonlinear processes (Tulppo et al., Am. J. Physiol. 271:H244–H252, 1996; Brennan et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 48:1342–1347, 2001). The lag-1 RR interval Poincare´ plot, a two-dimensional plot constructed by plotting consecutive RR intervals, is a representation of RR time series on phase space or Cartesian plane (Liebovitch and Scheurle, Complexity 5:34–43, 2000). It is extensively used for qualitative visualization of physiological signals. Poincare´ plot is commonly applied to assess the dynamics of heart rate variability (Tulppo et al., Am. J. Physiol. 271:H244–H252, 1996; Acharya et al., Med. Biol. Eng. Comput. 44(12):1031–1051, 2006; Tulppo et al., Am. J. Physiol. 247:H810–H816, 1998; Toichi et al., J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 62:79–84, 1997; Hayano et al., Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 14:1480–1488, 1999). The quantitative analysis of Poincare´ plot predominantly means the mathematical characterization of the shape of the plot. In the following sections we will discuss both the qualitative and quantitative techniques of Poincare´ plot for analysing HRV signal.

RR intervals, is a representation of RR time series on phase space or Cartesian plane [113]. It is extensively used for qualitative visualization of physiological signals. Poincare´ plot is commonly applied to assess the dynamics of heart rate variability [111,114–117]. The quantitative analysis of Poincare´ plot predominantly means the mathematical characterization of the shape of the plot. In the following sections we will discuss both the qualitative and quantitative techniques of Poincare´ plot for analysing HRV signal.

2.2 Visualization of HRV Using Poincare´ Plot
The visual analysis of Poincare´ plot is termed as qualitative analysis technique. In HRV analysis, the qualitative technique was ﬁrst used to visualize the complex HRV pattern which could be produced by alterations and interactions of autonomic and cardiovascular systems accompanying heart failure [91]. The result of qualitative analysis provides additional information to the standard time-domain analysis of HRV signal. It introduced the use of Poincare´ plot to characterize the pattern of RR intervals of a healthy heart. Moreover, the visual analysis of RR intervals used to distinguish patients with advanced heart failure from healthy individuals [91].
Comet
This pattern represents the lengthening of RR intervals which indicates increased beat-to-beat variability as well as overall range for healthy subjects (Fig. 2.1) [91].
Torpedo
This indicates that the change between consecutive RR intervals is minimal. However, this minimal deviation does not indicate the ﬁxed heart rate but suggests gradual change in heart rate while maintaining small beat-to-beat variability (Fig. 2.2) [91].
Fan
It has a small increase in RR interval length (i.e. shorter overall range) which is associated with greater dispersion in consecutive RR intervals (Fig. 2.3) [91].

2.3 Quantiﬁcation of Poincare´ Plot of RR Interval

Complex
This pattern creates stepwise clusters of points with distinct gaps between the clusters. The stepwise change in RR intervals represents lack of graded relationship between successive RR intervals and linked to nonlinear behaviour (Fig. 2.4) [91].
2.3 Quantiﬁcation of Poincare´ Plot of RR Interval
Quantitative analysis of Poincare´ plot quantiﬁes the differences among the shape of the plots. It is a mathematical approach to characterize the plot. The RR interval Poincare´ plot typically appears as an elongated cloud of points oriented along the line of identity (RRn = RRn+1). Hence, the shape of the plot is measured as the dispersion of points perpendicular to the line of identity, termed as short-term variability, and along the line of identity, termed as long-term variability [89, 111]. Approaches of quantifying Poincare´ plot are described in the following sections.

2.3.1 Ellipse-Fitting Technique

Most researchers have adopted the ellipse-ﬁtting technique to characterize the
Poincare´ plot mathematically as shown in Fig. 2.5. The major axis of the ﬁtted
ellipse is aligned with the line of identity, line passes through origin with slope 45◦, and the minor axis is perpendicular to the line of identity which has a slope of 135◦ and passes through centroid of the plot. Hence, the major and minor axis of
the ﬁtted ellipse can be expressed as

RRn = RRn+1

(2.1)

and

RRn + RRn+1 = 2RR,

(2.2)

where RR represents the RR interval series used in the Poincare´ plot and RR represents the mean value of RR interval series. In the ellipse-ﬁtting technique, the dispersion of the points along minor axis measures the width of the plot, whereas the dispersion of the points along the major axis measures the length of the plot. The distance of ith point of the plot, P(RRi, RRi+1), from major and minor axis, respectively, can be expressed as

using assumptions E[RRi]=E[RRi+m] and E[RR2i ]=E[RR2i+m]. This shows that SD1 and SD2 of Poincare´ plot are directly related to the basic statistical measures,
standard deviation of RR interval (SDRR) and standard deviation of the successive
difference of RR interval (SDSD) [112].

2.3 Quantiﬁcation of Poincare´ Plot of RR Interval

Fig. 2.6 Details the construction of the width (or delta-RR interval) histogram, the RR interval histogram and the length histogram. Each of these histograms is a projection of the points of the Poincare´ plot. Figure adapted from Brennan et al. [112]
2.3.2 Histogram Techniques
Intuitively, histogram is a graphical way to summarize the distribution of a univariate data set. It organizes a group of data points into user-speciﬁed ranges. Adapting the histogram technique to quantify Poincare´ plot requires converting 2D Poincare´ plot signal into a univariate signal, which is achieved through various projections of the points. Therefore, in histogram technique the shape of the Poincare´ plot is quantiﬁed by measuring the statistical properties of the various projections of the plot [87, 89, 94]. Figure 2.6 shows three main projections of the plot.
RR Interval Histogram
The histogram of the Poincare´ plot points projected onto the X axis or the Y axis. Since the points in lag-1 Poincare´ plot represent the consecutive RR intervals, projecting them onto one of the axes represents the RR interval series (RR). The RR interval histogram is usually quantiﬁed by the mean and standard deviation, which

22

2 Quantitative Poincare´ Plot

correspond directly to the same measures of RR denoted by RR and SDRR. Therefore, this projection of Poincare´ plot provides summary information on the overall HRV characteristics.

“Width” or Delta-RR Interval Histogram
This is the histogram of the Poincare´ plot points projected on the line of identity. The X value of the point is on the line of identity while the Y value of the point corresponds to the perpendicular distance of the point from the line of identity. It is not exactly equivalent t√o the delta-RR interval histogram; the abscissa has been scaled by the factor 1/ 2. As expected of the ΔRR intervals, the histogram has a zero mean. Therefore, the standard deviation of the width histogram is equal to SD1, which is a scaling of the SDSD measure as shown in Eq. 2.9. This histogram provides summary information on the short-term characteristics.

“Length” Histogram
This histogram is obtained by projecting the Poincare´ plot points perpendicular onto the line of identity. The histogram is described mathematically by the distribution of x2 and the standard deviation is, therefore, equivalently equal to SD2. Consequently, due to its connection with SD2, the length histogram portrays the long-term characteristics of HRV.

2.4 Relationship Between Poincare´ Shape and Linear HRV Measure

The autocorrelation function is an important measure of HRV simply because its Fourier transform is the power spectrum of intervals. The autocorrelation function of the RR intervals is deﬁned by Brennan et al. [112] as

γ(m) = E[RRiRRi+m],

(2.11)

where m is the time delay. Brennan et al. [112] have also deﬁned SD1 and SD2 with respect to autocorrelation function as follows:

SD12 = γRR(0) − γRR(1) SD22 = γRR(0) + γRR(1) − 2RR2,

(2.12) (2.13)

2.5 Conclusion

23

where γRR(0) and γRR(1) are the autocorrelation functions for lag-0 and lag-1 RR interval and RR is the mean of RR intervals. From Eqs. 2.12 and 2.13, it is obvious that the measures SD1 and SD2 are derived from the correlation (at lag 0 and 1) and mean of RR interval time series. The above equation sets are derived for unit time delay Poincare´ plot. Researchers have shown interest in plots with different time delays to get a better insight in the time-series signal. Usually the time delay is a multiple of the cycle length or the sampling time of the signal [118]. The dependency among the variables is controlled by the choice of time delay, and the most conventional analysis is performed with higher-order linear correlation between points. In the case of plotting the 2D phase space with lag-m the equations for SD1 and SD2 can be represented as

SD12 = γRR(0) − γRR(m) ⇒ SD1 = F(γRR(0), γRR(m))

(2.14)

and

SD22 = γRR(0) + γRR(m) − 2RR2

⇒ SD2 = F(γRR(0), γRR(m)),

(2.15)

where γRR(m) is the autocorrelation function for lag-m RR interval. This implies that the standard descriptors for any arbitrary m lag Poincare´ plot is a function of autocorrelation of the signal at lag-0 and lag-m.

2.5 Conclusion
Poincare´ plot is a popular HRV analysis tool among clinicians due to its ability to visually represent nonlinear dynamics of HRV. We explained and derived the development of Poincare´ plot both as a qualitative and quantitative tool for HRV analysis. Existing descriptors of Poincare´ plot are discussed and links with statistical HRV measures are shown. These indicate that, despite the ability to represent nonlinear dynamics, existing measures of Poincare´ plot are unable to quantify this information effectively. Hence, the vast potential of Poincare´ plot in HRV analysis is still unexplored. In the following chapters, we will discuss improvements of existing measures and development of novel measures to better quantiﬁcation of dynamical information of HRV signal using Poincare´ plot.

Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

Abstract In this chapter, we present new results in developing a novel mathematical model that describes the interactions between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems and heart rate ﬂuctuations over a short-term period of 5–10 min. While our model is based upon well-accepted physiological principles, the mathematical formulation permits in-depth numerical and analytical investigations yielding valuable insight into clinical RR interval analysis techniques.
3.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we present new results in developing a novel mathematical model that describes the interactions between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems and heart rate ﬂuctuations over a short-term period of 5–10 min. While our model is based upon well-accepted physiological principles, the mathematical formulation permits in-depth numerical and analytical investigations yielding valuable insight into clinical RR interval analysis techniques.
Standard analysis techniques commonly estimate the levels of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity from the variability in the RR intervals. Our attention has focused on two speciﬁc HRV analysis techniques. The ﬁrst is the frequencydomain spectral analysis of RR intervals [14, 101, 119–121]. RR interval Poincare´ plot analysis is the second technique [59, 87, 89, 91, 94]. The main objective of our model is to provide insight into the signiﬁcance of Poincare´ plot morphology, not to accurately reproduce the complex autonomic activity of any particular individual.
Our model emulates the differing varieties of Poincare´ plot patterns seen in subjects over a range of sympathovagal balances. In addition, the model provides a unique link between spectral analysis techniques and the emerging analysis techniques that rely on the shape and/or other morphological properties of the Poincare´ plot. Analytical results on the “lengths” and “widths” of the Poincare´ plots

generated by our model are developed. Simulations are employed to conﬁrm the analytical results on the model. In order to evaluate the validity and scope of the model and analysis we provide results using a set of data from actual subjects.

3.2 Autonomous Nervous System and HRV Analysis
It is well known that perturbations to autonomic activity, such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia and vasomotor oscillations, cause corresponding ﬂuctuations in heart rate [8, 102]. HRV analysis seeks to determine the autonomic activity from heart rate variability. Spectral analysis is the standard technique used to determine the presence of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and vasomotor oscillations [8, 122]. This is accomplished by dividing the spectrum into low-(0.04– 0.15 Hz) and high-(0.15–0.4 Hz) frequency bands, known as the LF and HF bands, effectively distinguishing between rapid respiratory modulator activity and slow vasomotor modulation of heart rate (see Fig. 3.1a). HF power is supposedly a pure measure of parasympathetic activity, and LF power is reﬂective of sympathetic modulation and parasympathetic tone, although it is sometimes considered to reﬂect sympathetic tone [120]. In this chapter, spectral estimates are given by the autoregressive (AR) parametric technique using the modiﬁed covariance method [123] for the smooth spectrum and easy identiﬁcation of the spectral peaks.
The Poincare´ plot is a scatter plot of the current RR interval plotted against the preceding RR interval. Poincare´ plot analysis is a quantitative visual technique, whereby the shape of the plot is categorized into functional classes [59,91]. The plot provides summary information as well as detailed beat-to-beat information on

3.3 Physiological HRV Model

the behaviour of the heart [94]. Points above the line of identity indicate RR intervals that are longer than the preceding RR interval, and points below the line of identity indicate a shorter RR interval than the previous. Accordingly, the dispersion of points perpendicular to the line of identity (the “width”) reﬂects the level of short-term variability. This dispersion can be quantiﬁed by the standard deviation of the distances the points lie from the line of identity. This measure is equivalent to the standard deviation of the successive differences of the RR intervals (SDSD or RMSSD) [89]. The standard deviation of points along the line of identity (the “length”) reﬂects the standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN). Figure 3.1b details these quantitative measures of Poincare´ plot shape. Poincare´ plots appear under different names in the literature: scatter plots, ﬁrst return maps and Lorenz plots being prominent terms. A distinct advantage of Poincare´ plots is their ability to identify beat-to-beat cycles and patterns in data that are difﬁcult to identify with spectral analysis [59, 91].

3.3 Physiological HRV Model
In this section we develop a model using a coupled network of oscillators, each representing a speciﬁc characteristic or facet of the baroreﬂex and autonomic nervous system. The architecture of the network and the coupling are shown in Fig. 3.2. The coupling constants Cs and Cp denote the level at which the corresponding oscillator modulates the sinus node oscillator. For the purpose of clarity, we deﬁne the respiratory oscillator as the parasympathetic oscillator.

3.3.1 Sympathetic Oscillator

The sympathetic oscillator (S) is governed by Eq. 3.1:

s = sin(ωst)

(3.1)

28

3 Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

where s represents the level of sympathetic activation. Sympathetic activity occurs on a slow time scale, i.e. it reacts slowly, altering heart rate over a long duration [8, 101, 124]. Accordingly it is assigned a small value, producing slow waves of approximately 10–15 s duration. This oscillator represents the combined lowfrequency (LF) power of the HRV spectrum, which includes vasomotor activity. It is generally accepted that low levels of sympathetic activity will result in slow oscillations of sympathetic nerve activity entrained to the vasomotor oscillations.
As the level of sympathetic activity increases, these oscillations are damped and the ﬂuctuations disappear such that under intense sympathetic drive the heart rate becomes metronomic in its regularity. This damped effect can be achieved by taking ωs → 0 or by reducing the coupling between the sympathetic oscillator and the sinus oscillator by taking Cs → 0.

3.3.2 Parasympathetic Respiratory Oscillator

Respiratory oscillations affect both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. However, because of the slow response time of the sympathetic system, these rapid oscillations, often in the order of 2–3 seconds per cycle, are mediated purely by the parasympathetic system [8, 101, 124]. The effects of respiration are described by the parasympathetic respiratory oscillator (P), which is governed by Eq. 3.2:

p = sin(ωpt)

(3.2)

where p represents the level of parasympathetic respiratory activation. As the
parasympathetic system typically reacts faster than the sympathetic system, but altering heart rate over a much shorter duration, this oscillator has a value of ωp larger than ωs . Values in the simulation produce oscillations of duration between 2 and 5 s. This oscillator is intended to represent short-term activity impinging on the
sinus node via the parasympathetic nervous system.

3.3.3 Sinus Oscillator
The sinus node oscillator is based on the formulation of the well-known integral pulse frequency modulation (IPFM) model. Hyndman and Mohn ﬁrst suggested the IPFM model as a representation of the cardiac pacemaker and the suitability for modeling the sinus node has been discussed by a number of researchers in the area of point event processes [97, 99, 102]. The IPFM model is a useful description of how cardiac events are modulated by autonomic nervous activity and has had numerous applications in describing the generation of point event processes [99, 102]. The IPFM model generates heartbeats by integrating an input

signal until it reaches a preset threshold of unity. At this point a pulse is produced and the integrator is reset to zero. See Fig. 3.3. The mathematical representation is given in Eq. 3.3:

1=

tk+1 tk

(H

R

+

m(t

))dt

x(t) = ∑Nk=1 δ (t − tk)

(3.3)

The signal m(t) is the input signal representing autonomic activity and tk is the time of the kth R wave. When the input signal is zero the IPFM model generates heartbeats with an interval equal to I = 1/HR where HR is a variable parameter which represents mean heart rate. It is equal to the actual frequency of heartbeats
in the absence of any modulatory autonomic nervous activity. The input signal m(t) represents the effects of modulatory autonomic nervous input and is deﬁned by Eq. 3.4. If the input signal is positive then heartbeats are generated at a faster
rate while a negative input signal causes heartbeats to be generated at a slower rate. The function x(t) represents the series of pulses representing the heartbeats generated by the model while y(t) designates the integrator’s output as a function of time.

30

3 Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

We have formulated the modulation of the sinus oscillator by the sympathetic and parasympathetic oscillators as described by Eq. 3.4:

m(t) = Css(t) + Cp p(t)

(3.4)

As a result, the sinus oscillator beats at a base rate of HR Hertz, which is increased or decreased in an additive linear fashion by sympathetic and parasympathetic respiratory modulation. For the modulating frequencies to appear unaliased in the beat sequence, the mean beat frequency HR should be higher than the highest modulating frequency component, ωp :

HR

ωp 2π

>

ωs 2π

(3.5)

The coupling constants Cs and Cp reﬂect the levels of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of the sinus node, which is not equivalent to the tonic (mean) levels of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. The tonic autonomic inﬂuences are included in the parameter HR which is a combined function of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, hormonal responses and various parameters of the individual such as blood pressure. Accordingly HR is a function of the intrinsic heart rate HR0 and the tonic inﬂuences of the autonomic system commonly referred to as the sympathovagal balance [125]. While the exact nature of sympathovagal balance is not completely understood, this concept has been formalized by the following model, HR = HR0 × m × n , due to Rosenblueth and Simeone [124] and Katona et al. [126] in which m > 1 is the net sympathetic inﬂuence and n < 1 is the net parasympathetic inﬂuence. It is still being debated if there exist any reliable connections between the tonic inﬂuences m and n and the levels of modulation Cs and Cp; however, it is often observed that heart rate and HRV are inversely related.
Accordingly, we model HR as a free variable which is not determined explicitly by Cs or Cp. In other words, our model characterizes nervous activity as separate modulatory and static effects. Cs and Cp should be chosen such that HR + m(t) is strictly positive. Choosing Cs + Cp < HR guarantees this.

3.4 Mathematical Analysis of HRV Model Using Poincare´ Plot
This section develops a mathematical analysis used to investigate the length and width of the Poincare´ plots generated from the HRV model developed in the previous sections. As the model is a simpliﬁcation of actual HRV mechanisms these results will not apply to real HRV data in an exact sense. However, the results provide clear insight into the manner in which Poincare´ plot descriptors vary as sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation levels are varied. Speciﬁcally, we characterize the theoretical dependency between low- and high-frequency modulators and the shape of an RR interval Poincare´ plot generated by our model.

3.4 Mathematical Analysis of HRV Model Using Poincare´ Plot

31

In accomplishing this analysis we require an explicit solution to the RR interval series. The remainder of this section derives this result. By deﬁning the time of the initial beat to be the origin t0 = 0, the deﬁning equation for the IPFM oscillator (Eq. 3.3) can be expressed non-recursively as

tk
[HR + m(t)]dt = k
0

(3.6)

where m(t) is the modulating signal. In our model m(t) consists of two frequency
components. It turns out to be just as easy to work with N frequency components, so we consider m(t) = ∑Nn=1 Cn cos(ωnt + φn) with ωn 2πHR for all n, i.e. slow modulation. The deﬁning equation becomes

The δk terms represent the amount each beat deviates from the regular pulse train tk = kI . Equation 3.9 can be linearized about δk = 0 provided ωnδk is small for all nε[1..N]. If the event times are close to a regular pulse train (δk < I/2π) and the modulation frequencies are less than the mean beat frequency (ωn < 2πHR) it is obvious that ωnδk 1. Hence for a large class of practical pulse trains, including RR intervals, a linear analysis is an accurate approximation. Linearizing about δk = 0

3 Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

The RR intervals are RRk = tk+1 − tk . For our model, N = 2 and C1 = Cs, C2 = Cp, ω1 = ωs, ω2 = ωp and φ1 = φ2 = 0. In this case, Eq. 3.11 provides us with an accurate approximation to the RR interval series generated by our HRV
model. This result holds so long as the intervals are approximately regular and the
modulation is slow. This is generally the case for RR intervals. However, for subjects
with very large HRV the assumption that the intervals are approximately regular may be somewhat inaccurate. For the assumption δk < I/2π to be compromised, an RR interval would have to deviate from the mean RR interval by an amount I greater than I/π ≈ 0.32π.

3.4.1 Length of Poincare´ Plot Main Cloud

In this section we develop an approximation to the length of a Poincare´ plot,

depicted in Fig. 3.1b, as a function of the HRV model’s coupling constants Cs

and Cp. Researchers, who are dealing with noisy data, often employ the standard

deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN) as a measure of Poincare´ length [89, 111].

For the purposes of this section, in which sequences lacking random variability are

analysed, it’s simpler to deﬁne the length to be the distance between the extreme

right- and left-most points of the Poincare´ plot. The agreement between these two

measures is a simple scaling by a constant. Thus, length is deﬁned as the difference

between the largest and smallest RR intervals: L = max RRk − min RRk.

Analytically deriving the maximum and minimum of the RR interval series from

Eq. 3.11 is n’t straightforward; fortunately, these quantities can be approximated. By employing the standard approximation (1 + z)−1 = 1 − z for z << 1, Eq. 3.11

Assuming the maximum values of the time-varying sinusoids (those dependent upon k) of Eq. 3.14 are eventually sampled simultaneously at some point in time, an approximation to the upper limit of the length is obtained by replacing the sinusoids with the value 1. This approach gives the maximum length obtainable, a ﬁgure that is strictly an upper bound yet also serves as an approximation to the true length L for modulation frequencies signiﬁcantly less than the mean beat frequency. This is by virtue of having sampled frequently enough to examine arbitrarily close to the upper bound at some point in time. The upper bound on L is then twice the sum of the amplitudes of the frequency components described in Eq. 3.14. As Cn << 1, L is largely determined by the ﬁrst-order terms. Equation 3.15 is the ﬁrst-order approximation to length. It is noted that this quantity is no longer the strict upper bound on L due to discarding of the higher-order contributions; however, it remains an approximation to the true length:

The actual (true) Poincare´ plot length as a function of the HRV model’s coupling
constants Cs and Cp over the range 0.0–0.15 is shown in Fig. 3.4a (obtained via simulations). Length appears to be dependent upon Cs and Cp in an almost identical manner and to behave linearly, in agreement with this analysis. Figure
3.4c compares true length to the approximation to length given by Eq. 3.16. For Cs + Cp << 1 the approximation is in excellent agreement with the true length. As Cs + Cpincreases, second-order inﬂuences begin to become signiﬁcant due to nonlinear effects becoming prominent, as expected from the analysis. The
approximately identical manner that the coupling constants control the length can be explained by noting that sin(x) ≈ x when x 1 and for low modulation frequencies ωp 2πHR. Accordingly, Eq. 3.16 behaves as

These results state that high- and low-frequency modulations affect L in equivalent manners for slow modulation and in a linear fashion for small coupling intensities. Under these conditions, length reﬂects neither the high- nor the low-frequency

modulations more signiﬁcantly than the other. Thus, for practical purposes, length may be considered a measure of total modulation and is akin to the total power of the modulating signal.

3.4.2 Width of the Poincare´ Plot Main Cloud

The width of the main cloud of an RR interval Poincare´ plot characterizes the dispersion of points about the line of identity. Common measures of the width are the standard deviation and the root mean square of the successive differences of the RR intervals (SDSD or RMSSD) [89, 111]. As for the length of the modelbased Poincare´ plot, the lack of any random component is exploited and the width is deﬁned to be the distance between the extremities as depicted in Fig. 3.1b. Thus,
√ the width is W = max |Δ RRk| 2 as Fig. 3.5 details. This expression involves the
k
“delta” RR intervals, Δ RRk = RRk − RRk−1, which are also known as the successive differences of the RR intervals. They are given by

As can be seen from Eq. 3.18, the delta RR intervals posses no D.C. component, which is expected due to the zero average. Similar frequency content is present as for the length, except for being phase shifted and being multiplied by an extra sin(·) term leading to the squared coefﬁcient. An approximation to W is determined by taking an upper bound for W (by replacing the time-varying sinusoids with unity) and retaining only ﬁrst-order terms as detailed in the calculations for length:

It can be seen from Fig. 3.4b that the level of high-frequency

3.4 Mathematical Analysis of HRV Model Using Poincare´ Plot

Roughly speaking, the width of a Poincare´ plot is a function of the weighted sum of the low- and high-frequency amplitudes, where each amplitude is weighted by the respective angular frequency. Accordingly, higher-frequency components contribute to the width in larger amounts, and lower-frequency components contribute at minor yet still signiﬁcant levels. As will be explained later, Poincare´ plot width should correlate highly with high-frequency power (HF) and correlate at small levels with low-frequency power (LF).

3.4.3 Poincare´ Plot Morphological Properties for the HRV Model

As the previous sections have shown, the correspondence between the HRV model’s parameters and the Poincare´ plot’s shape can be accurately approximated by a linear transformation for small coupling intensities:

The signiﬁcance of this result is that the morphology of a Poincare´ plot encodes the amplitudes of the modulation signal, allowing recovery of the amplitudes for signals composed of two known frequency components:

γ = sin ωp 2HR − sin ωs 2HR
For our model, it is theoretically possible to estimate similar characteristics to HRV spectral analysis, such as LF power, HF power and HF/LF ratios, from the shape of the Poincare´ plot by assigning appropriate values to the constants ωs and ωp. This is in addition to investigating the detailed beat-to-beat characteristics of HRV data. It should be noted that this property only applies exactly for modulation signals composed of only two frequency components. Perhaps three-dimensional Poincare´ plots can resolve three frequency components, and so on. How well the correspondence generalizes to actual HRV data is dependent on how well the HRV spectrum is approximated by two dominant peaks.

3 Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

3.5 Simulation Results in Clinical Examples

In this section, we demonstrate that our model displays the features of real RR intervals under various induced autonomic balances. We consider the following conditions: complete autonomic blockade, parasympathetic blockade and normal sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. Poincare´ plots of the model’s output are compared to plots of actual RR intervals obtained from patients under the prescribed autonomic perturbations. The model’s simulated autonomic balance is adjusted by varying the coupling constants, which alters the levels at which the oscillators inﬂuence the sinus oscillator. For all simulations, except where otherwise mentioned, the following constants were used:
HR = 1.18 Hz, ωs = 2π × 0.025 Rad/s, and ωp = 2π × 0.344 Rad/s (3.24)
HR corresponds to an RR interval of 850 ms. The period of the sympathetic oscillator is set to approximately 40 s and the parasympathetic oscillator is set to a period of approximately 3 s.

3.5.1 Complete Autonomic Blockade
First, we consider the model’s output in the absence of coupling, a state that is easily simulated with Csand Cp taking on very small values. Consider Fig. 3.6b for which the coupling constants were Cs = Cp = 0.01. The Poincare´ plot appears as a single dense point termed a “tight cluster”. Due to the low coupling, there is very little variation in m(t) and subsequently the sinus oscillator beats at a constant frequency of HR Hertz. Accordingly the RR intervals varied little from the constant value 1/HR seconds. The behaviour of a de-nerved heart, such as found in the case of a transplant patient as in Fig. 3.6a, is mimicked. Figure 3.6c shows the power spectra of plots (a) and (b). It is seen that neither the transplant patient nor the model has any signiﬁcant spectral power in either the LF or HF bands.

3.5.2 Unopposed Sympathetic Activity–Parasympathetic Blockade
This scenario is simulated by a high degree of coupling between the sympathetic oscillator and the sinus oscillator while a low-coupling level is used for the parasympathetic respiratory oscillator. Accordingly, the coupling constants take the values Cs = 0.21 and Cp = 0. The model’s output, viewed as a Poincare´ plot in

Fig. 3.7b, is a slender closed loop oriented along the line y = x and is suggestive of a “cigar” due to its shape. No variability is present other than the motion around the loop, a direct result of excluding the parasympathetic respiratory oscillator.
The plot in Fig. 3.7a is of a healthy subject who has been infused with atropine. The variability witnessed in this plot is therefore largely a product of sympathetic activity. The total lack of any short-term variability in our model’s output prevents

a clear comparison to this subject except at the most qualitative level. Figure 3.7c shows the effect of artiﬁcially adding a small amount of short-term variability to the model’s output by adding zero mean Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 10 ms. to the simulated intervals. A Poincare´ plot very similar to actual observed cigarshaped plots is observed. Real-life physiological systems usually do contain some level of spontaneous random variability that is best modelled as noise, particularly at this level. The model’s output resembles RR intervals recorded from patients with degraded parasympathetic nervous control, such as patients with heart failure [89]. The length of the cigar is directly proportional to the amplitude of the sympathetic modulation of the sinus oscillator.
The power spectrum of the atropine-infused subject in Fig. 3.7a is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3.7d. The spectrum is seen to consist of a substantial level of LF power and very little HF power. The middle panel of Fig. 3.7d shows the power spectra of the model-generated RR intervals. The single peak in the LF band is the effect of the sympathetic oscillator with a coupling intensity of 0.21. Finally, the lower panel of Fig. 3.7d shows the power spectrum of the model-generated RR intervals with added noise. The noise adds a constant level across all frequencies to the power spectrum, and therefore its presence does not overly alter the shape of the spectrum.

Figure adapted from Brennan et al. [118]

3.5.3 Sympathetic-Parasympathetic Balance
In this scenario, levels of parasympathetic respiratory activity are introduced. This is simulated by way of a small coupling intensity for the parasympathetic respiratory oscillator in addition to a high level of sympathetic coupling. Figure 3.8b shows the model’s RR interval output for the coupling constants Cs = 0.3 and Cp = 0.05. A large degree of variability emerges in the model’s output, in which the parasympathetic oscillator is responsible for the ﬂanging effect or widening of the cigar shape into a “comet”. Comparing Fig. 3.8a and b shows how closely the simulated RR intervals resemble a Poincare´ plot of a subject at rest breathing quietly in the supine position. Increasing the parasympathetic respiratory oscillator’s

42

3 Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

coupling intensity increases the width of the comet and consequently the level of short-term variability in the RR intervals. Figure 3.8c demonstrates this effect with Cp taking on the value of 0.1. The width of the comet is also dependent on the frequency of the parasympathetic oscillator in an intuitive manner: larger values of ωp yield wider comets because short-term variability is increased.
The power spectrum of the supine subject of Fig. 3.8a is presented in the upper panel of Fig. 3.8d. A substantial level of both LF and HF power is displayed. The middle panel of Fig. 3.8d shows the power spectrum of the model-generated RR intervals. The two peaks produced by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic oscillators with coupling intensities 0.3 and 0.05 are clearly shown. The lower panel of Fig. 3.8d displays the power spectrum of Fig. 3.8c, which has an increased value of 0.1 for the parasympathetic oscillator’s coupling.
A signiﬁcant difference exists between the Poincare´ plots of the model-generated RR intervals and the RR intervals obtained clinically: the density of the points in the simulated cases is skewed towards the lower left corner of the plot while actual RR intervals are more centrally distributed. The core of this discrepancy lies in the highly periodic nature of the oscillators. Fluctuations produced by the actual autonomic nervous system are not pure sinusoidal signals. Instead they resemble a random walk which obtains low- and high RR interval lengths occasionally while usually ﬂuctuating about a mean value without deviating widely. It is important to observe that the lengths and widths of Fig. 3.8a and b are roughly the same. Our model shows it is this feature that corresponds to the balance of low- and highfrequency power being similar, not the dispersion of the points within the Poincare´ plot.
At this point it is interesting to consider how well the results of the previous section apply to actual data obtained from subjects under various autonomic conditions. The results are not expected to apply completely as they stem from a model of a discrete spectrum. However, the general principles identiﬁed by the analysis should be evident. That is, the length of the Poincare´ plot should be approximately equivalently dependent upon low-frequency modulation and high-frequency modulation. In addition, the width is expected to be dependent upon high-frequency modulation more strongly than on low-frequency modulation. To these predictions, we apply the equations developed in the previous section to RR intervals obtained from subjects under various autonomic conditions.

3.5.4 Data Set Acquisition
We employ the data set of a previous study [94] as it contains subjects over a wide range of autonomic conditions. The data set consists of ten healthy subjects (ﬁve female, ﬁve male) aged between 20 and 40 years (mean 30.2, sd 7.2). Each subject underwent four autonomic perturbations: baseline study with subjects in

the supine position in a quite environment; seventy-degree head-up tilt which increases sympathetic activity and decreases parasympathetic activity; atropine infusion which markedly decreases parasympathetic nervous system activity and transdermal scopolamine which increases parasympathetic nervous activity. In all, 40 records were collected, each containing 1,024 RR intervals.

3.5.5 Data Set Analysis
For each data set, the length and width of the Poincare´ plot and the LF and HF power wer√e calculated. The length was calculated by L = 2SDRR, and the width by W = 2SDSD as can be derived from simple geometry. The LF and HF parameters were calculated by using the AR technique with the modiﬁed covariance technique [123]. The bands were LF = 0.04–0.15 Hz and HF = 0.15–0.4 Hz. First, we derive the length and width of the Poincare´ plot from the LF and HF power by using Eq. 3.22 and compare the derived length and width with the actual length and width by plotting them against each other as scatter plot. The closer the values are to being identical, the closer the scatter plot resembles the line of identity. Equation 3.22 requires the values of the constants ωs, ωp and HR. The value of HR is calculated as the inverse of the average RR interval. The choice of suitable values for ωs and ωp is akin to the choice of the LF and HF frequency bands. The midfrequencies of the bands would seem the most appropriate choice, i.e., ωs = 2π(0.1) and ωp = 2π(0.28) radians/s.
Figure 3.9a displays the derived length on the vertical axis and the actual length on the horizontal axis. The points do reﬂect the line of identity; however, there exists a fair amount of variability which indicates that Eq. 3.22 does not hold entirely. The goodness of ﬁt to the line of identity can be quantiﬁed by the correlation coefﬁcient. Figure 3.9a has a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.94 indicating that Eq. 3.22 holds reasonably well. In other words, Eq. 3.22 is explaining the main trend of the actual length very well. Equation 3.22 has a tendency to underestimate the actual length. This can be partially explained by noting that the length is a measure of all the modulation; the LF and HF measures, however, only consider the power from 0.04 Hz upwards. The derived width vs. the actual width is plotted on Fig. 3.9b. A very good ﬁt with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.97 occurs. This indicates that Eq. 3.22 is very good at predicting the width of a Poincare´ plot. The superior performance of the width over the length can be explained by noting that the hypothesized reason for the underestimation of length is that the very-low-frequency power has been ignored. Ignoring the very-low-frequency power will not adversely affect the width as it is dominated by high-frequency power (HF).
The same analysis is now repeated for the reverse situation. Starting with the length and width of a Poincare´ plot, we derive the LF and HF power using Eq. 3.23 and assign LF = CS and HF = CP. The derived values of LF and HF are then compared to the actual LF and HF values calculated by standard spectral analysis.

Figure 3.9c displays the actual LF power vs. the derived LF power. The correlation coefﬁcient of the plot is 0.81, which indicates a reasonable linear ﬁt. However, it is clear that the main trend of the relationship between LF power and length and width is clearly captured by Eq. 3.23. Figure 3.9d compares derived HF power with actual HF power. A correlation coefﬁcient of 0.93 indicates that Eq. 3.23 explains the dependency of HF on the length and width very well.
These results clearly show that the principles identiﬁed from Eq. 3.22 and Eq. 3.23 are present for actual HRV data. It must be remembered that the equations are not expected to hold perfectly as they were derived for the HRV model under

the assumption of two modulation frequencies. The fact that a discrete spectrum consisting of only two components can explain so much about the relationships between LF, HF, length and width of a Poincare´ plot is remarkable.

3.5.6 Poincare´ Plot Morphology for Real Data
In this section we discuss the signiﬁcance of the length and width descriptors of Poincare´ plots. The results of the previous sections imply that the width is a measure of short-term variability and the length is a measure of total variability. This result has consequences for the correlations between frequency-domain indices and Poincare´ plot indices. Attempting to correlate LF power with Poincare´ length (or equivalent SDNN measures) will explain only part of the variations in Poincare´ length. Substantial portions of the variations are due to the codependency with HF power and will appear as uncorrelated noise. In data sets where signiﬁcant variations in both LF and HF power are present, our model predicts that Poincare´ length will correlate reasonably well with both LF and HF powers; however, it will correlate highly with neither due to the variations introduced by the other. For Poincare´ width, the dependencies upon HF power are stronger than those of LF power. A strong correlation is expected when comparing HF power to Poincare´ width, as the variations due to LF power will be small. LF power should correlate with Poincare´ width, albeit at low levels, because LF power does inﬂuence the width, but the variations present due to HF power are large and reduce the correlation coefﬁcient markedly.
Many of these results have already been shown experimentally. Speciﬁcally, our ﬁndings corroborate the ﬁndings of Otzenberger et al. [127], who found that SDNN (Poincare´ length) correlated with both LF and HF power, and RMSSD (Poincare´ width) correlated with HF power and to a lesser extent, LF power. Tullppo et al. [111], who investigated HRV and exercise, also present experimental results which agree with our ﬁndings: SDNN correlated almost equally with HF (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient: r =0.75) and LF (r =0.72) power, and RMSSD correlated highly with HF power (r =0.97) and to a lesser yet signiﬁcant extent with LF power (r =0.65).

3.6 Conclusion
Poincare´ plots are generated from the model and compared to Poincare´ plots generated from subjects under various autonomic conditions. Now one can clearly understand how various autonomic regimes appear on the Poincare´ plot through the use of the model. Traditionally, researchers have identiﬁed length and width of Poincare´ plots with low- and high-frequency powers, respectively, of the HRV

46

3 Poincare´ Plot Interpretation of HRV Using Physiological Model

signal. However, with the use of our model, we establish that the length and width are not separately related, but are a weighted combination of low- and highfrequency power. This investigation provides a theoretical link between frequencydomain spectral analysis techniques and time-domain Poincare´ plot analysis.
To determine the degree to which our results generalize to actual HRV data we applied the model-based formulae to a set of clinical data. The results indicate that the formulae do identify clear trends in the relationships between the spectral components and Poincare´ length and width. This gives deﬁnitive evidence that, for HRV data, the length is a display of total modulation and the width indicates predominately short-term modulation. In summary, this chapter provides clear mathematical insight into the nature of observed data.

Chapter 4
Poincare´ Plot in Capturing Nonlinear Temporal Dynamics of HRV

Abstract The method and importance of capturing temporal variation using standard descriptors (SD1 and SD2) of Poincare´ plot have been presented in Chap. 2. However, this does not include the temporal variation at point-to-point level of the plot. In addition, SD1 and SD2 descriptors are linear statistics (Brennan et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 48:1342–1347, 2001) and hence the measures do not directly quantify the nonlinear temporal variations in the time series contained in the Poincare´ plot. Although SD1/SD2 is considered as a nonlinear measure, it yields mixed results when applied to the data sets that form multiple clusters in a Poincare´ plot due to complex dynamic behaviours (Brennan et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 48:1342–1347, 2001). This is because the technique relies on the existence of a single cluster or a deﬁned pattern (Christopher et al., Biophys.

Therefore, further studies are required in deﬁning new descriptors for analysing temporal variability of time series using Poincare´ plots.

4.1 Introduction

The method and importance of capturing temporal variation using standard descriptors (SD1 and SD2) of Poincare´ plot have been presented in Chap. 2. However, this does not include the temporal variation at point-to-point level of the plot. In addition, SD1 and SD2 descriptors are linear statistics [112] and hence the measures do not directly quantify the nonlinear temporal variations in the time series contained in the Poincare´ plot. Although SD1/SD2 is considered as a nonlinear measure, it yields mixed results when applied to the data sets that form multiple clusters in a Poincare´ plot due to complex dynamic behaviours [112]. This is because the technique relies on the existence of a single cluster or a deﬁned

pattern [128,129]. Therefore, further studies are required in deﬁning new descriptors for analysing temporal variability of time series using Poincare´ plots. Another driving force behind this study is the fact that the visual pattern of the Poincare´ plot of heart rate variability signals relies upon clinical scenarios and the application of the existing standard descriptors in various studies has resulted in limited success.
The inherent assumption behind using consecutive RR points in Poincare´ plot is that the “present-RR-interval” signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the “following-RR-interval”. Various researchers reported that varying lags of Poincare´ plot give better understanding about the autonomic control of the heart rate that inﬂuence the short-term and long-term variability of the heart rate [57,91]. A system can have different shortand long-term correlations on different time scales. When the sampling interval is less than the short-time correlation length, then these short-time correlations can be predominantly seen [130]. So in the context of short- or long-term variability, any point can inﬂuence at least a few successive points. Lerma et al. [131] reported that the current RR interval can inﬂuence up to approximately eight subsequent RR intervals in the context of the short-term variability. In another study, Thakre and Smith examined the theoretical demand with different lags and showed that there is a curvilinear relationship between lag Poincare´ plot indices for normal subjects, which is lost in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients [132]. The relation between lags and width of Poincare´ plot (SD1) has been reported by Goshvarpour et al. [133]. Therefore, measurement from a series of lagged Poincare´ plots (multiple lag correlation) can potentially provide more information about the behaviour of the underlying system than the conventional lag-1 plot measurements [131].
The hypothesis of this chapter is that any descriptor that captures temporal information and is a function of multiple lag correlation, would provide more insight into the system rather than conventional measurements of variability of Poincare´ plot (SD1 and SD2), which are parameters of a lag-1 correlation. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose a novel descriptor, complex correlation measure (CCM), for Poincare´ plot that can be applied to measure the temporal variation of the Poincare´ plot and is a function of multiple lag correlation of the signal.

4.3 Limitation of Standard Descriptors of Poincare´ Plot
SD1 and SD2 represent the distribution of the signal in 2D space and carry only spatial (shape) information. It should be noted that many possible RR interval series result in identical plot with exactly similar SD1 and SD2 values irrespective of different temporal structures. For example, two signals with similar SD1 and SD2 values, top panels (Fig. 4.1), are different in terms of temporal structure, bottom panels (Fig. 4.1).

Lerma et al. have shown that the measurement from a multiple lag Poincare´ plot provides more information than any measure from single lag Poincare´ plot [131]. Indeed, the Poincare´ plot at any lag-m is more of a generalized scenario, where other levels of temporal variation of the dynamic system are hidden. As shown in equation sets 2.14 and 2.15, for any m, the descriptors SD1 and SD2 only indicate m lag correlation information of the plot. This essentially conveys overall behaviour of the system neglecting its detail temporal variation. The Poincare´ plot of RR interval time series for three different lags is shown in Fig. 4.2. From the plots, it is obvious that for any time-series signal, different lag plots better reveal the behaviour of the signal than the single lag plot. The CCM is not only related to the SD1 and SD2, but it also provides temporal information, which can be used to quantify the temporal dynamics of the system.

4.4 Complex Correlation Measures in Poincare´ Plot: A Novel Nonlinear Descriptor

The proposed descriptor CCM is computed using a moving window which embeds the temporal information of the signal. This moving window is comprised of three consecutive points from the Poincare´ plot and the area of the triangle formed by

these three points is computed. This area measures the temporal variation of the points in the window. If three points are aligned on a line then the area is zero, which represents the linear alignment of the points. Moreover, since the individual measure involves three points of the two-dimensional plot, it is comprised of at least four different points of the time series for lag m = 1 and at most six points in case of lag m ≥ 3. Hence the measure conveys information about four different lag correlations of the signal. Now, suppose the ith moving window is comprised of points a(x1, y1), b(x2, y2) and c(x3, y3) then the area of the triangle (A) for ith window can be computed using the following determinant:

A(i) =

1 2

x1 y1 1 x2 y2 1

,

(4.1)

x3 y3 1

where A is deﬁned on the real line ℜ and

A(i) = 0, if points a, b and c are on a straight line > 0, counterclockwise orientation the points a, b and c < 0, clockwise orientation of the points a, b and c.

If Poincare´ plot is composed of N points then the temporal variation of the plot, termed as CCM, is composed of all overlapping three point windows and can be calculated as

∑ CCM(m)

=

1 Cn(N −

N−2 i=1

(4.2)

where m represents lag of Poincare´ plot and Cn is the normalizing constant which is deﬁned as Cn = π ∗ SD1 ∗ SD2 and represents the area of the ﬁtted ellipse over Poincare´ plot. The lengths of major and minor axis of the ellipse are 2SD1 and
2SD2.
Let the RR time series be composed of N RR interval values and deﬁned as RR ≡ u1, u2, . . . , uN. As shown in Fig. 4.2, the lag-1 Poincare´ plot consists of N − 1 numbers of 2D set of points PP, where PP ∈ {ℜ, ℜ} can be represented by PP ≡ {(u1, u2), (u2, u3), . . . , (uN−1, uN)} and similarly for lag of m, N − m numbers of 2D points are expressed as

PP ≡ {(u1, u1 + m), (u2, u2 + m), . . . , (uN−m, uN )}.

Hence, for lag-m Poincare´ plot, the ﬁrst window will be composed of points {(u1, u1+m), (u2, u2+m), (u3, u3+m)} and from Eq. 4.1, the area A can be calculated as

Similarly the second and (N − m − 2)th window is composed of points {(u2, u2+m), (u3, u3+m), (u4, u4+m)} and {(uN−m−2, uN−2), (uN−m−1, uN−1), (uN−m, uN )} respectively. Hence, the area, A, for second and (N − m − 2)th window can be

Since RR intervals are discrete signal, the autocorrelation at lag m = j can be calculated as

(4.7)

Using Eqs. 2.14, 2.15, 4.6 and 4.7, CCM(m) can now be expressed as a function of autocorrelation at different lags. Hence,

CCM(m) = F [γRR(0), γRR(m − 2), γRR(m − 1), γRR(m + 1), γRR(m + 2)]. (4.8)
In the Eq. 4.8, CCM(m) represents the point-to-point variation of the Poincare´ plot with lag-m as a function of autocorrelation of lags 0, m − 2, m − 1, m + 1 and m + 2. This supports our hypothesis that CCM is measured using multiple lag correlation of the signal rather than single lag. For the conventional lag-1 Poincare´ plot CCM(1) can be represented as

CCM(1) = F [γRR(−1), γRR(0), γRR(2), γRR(3)] .

4.5 Mathematical Analysis of CCM

The CCM has been mathematically deﬁned and its relation with multiple lag correlation information of the signal has been presented in the previous section. In this section, we explore the different properties of CCM with synthetic RR interval data.

4.5.1 Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity is deﬁned as the rate of change of the value due to the change in temporal structure of the signal. The change in temporal structure of the signal in a window is achieved by surrogating the signal (i.e. data points) in that window. Sensitivity analysis of CCM will reveal the minimum length of the signal required to obtain a consistent CCM value. From the mathematical deﬁnition of CCM, we anticipated that CCM would be more sensitive to changes in temporal structure within the signal than the standard descriptors. We have compared the sensitivity of CCM with standard descriptors (SD1, SD2) in order to validate our assumption. A synthetic RR interval (rr02) time-series data from the open-access Physionet database [134] is used to validate the sensitivity analysis.
4.5.1.1 Sensitivity to Changes in Window Length
The sensitivity of CCM with different window lengths was analysed in order to deﬁne how it was affected by increasing the amount of change in temporal structure. The minimum number of samples required for using CCM as a measurement tool can also be deﬁned using this analysis. The sensitivity to changes in window length is measured by increasing the window length in each step, changing the temporal structure of that window using surrogation and then calculating the CCM of the changed signal. Increased window length effectively increases the number of surrogating points, which results in increased probability of the amount of change in temporal structure of the time-series signal. At each step the number of surrogated points is increased by 50. We calculated SD1, SD2 and CCM of the RR interval signal by increasing the number of surrogating points at a time. For a selected window length, we have shufﬂed the points 30 times, to minimize impact of bias of randomization, and calculated all descriptors each time after shufﬂing. Finally the surrogated values of descriptors were taken as a mean of the calculated values.

Then the sensitivity of descriptors ΔSD1 j, ΔSD2j and ΔCCM j was calculated using Eqs. 4.10–4.12:

ΔSD1 j

=

SD1 j − SD10 SD10

(4.10) (4.11) (4.12)

where SD10 = 0.36, SD20 = 0.08 and CCM0 = 0.16 were the parameters measured for the original data set without surrogation and j represents the window number whose data were surrogated and where, SD1 j, SD2 j and CCM j represent the SD1, SD2 and CCM values, respectively, after surrogation of jth step.
The change of descriptors SD1, SD2 and CCM with increasing number of shufﬂed RR intervals is presented in Fig. 4.3. From Fig. 4.3 it is obvious that the rate of change with number of shufﬂed RR intervals was higher for CCM at any point than SD1 and SD2. Therefore, we can conclude that CCM is more sensitive than SD1 and SD2 with respect to change in temporal structure or the change in autocorrelation of the signal which was earlier reported by Karmakar et al. [135]. Moreover, sensitivity of CCM with small number of RR intervals increases its applicability to short-length HRV signal analysis.

4.5.1.2 Homogeneity to Changes in Temporal Structure
In order to observe the homogeneity of sensitivity of CCM with changes in temporal structure over the whole timeline of the signal, we have used a ﬁxed-length moving window, changed the temporal structure of that window using surrogation and then calculated CCM value of the changed signal. We have divided the signal into 20 windows with 200 samples in each of them. To minimize the bias from surrogated values, we have shufﬂed the points of each window 30 times and calculated all descriptors each time after shufﬂing. Finally, the surrogated values of descriptors were taken as a mean of the calculated values. Since we divided the entire signal into 20 windows, it resulted in 20 values of SD1, SD2 and CCM. The sensitivity of descriptors ΔSD1 j, ΔSD2 j and ΔCCM j was calculated using Eqs. 4.10–4.12. Similar to the previous section, SD10, SD20 and CCM0 were the parameters measured for the original data set without surrogation and j represents the window number whose data were surrogated.
Value of ΔCCM is signiﬁcantly higher than ΔSD1 and ΔSD2 which indicates that CCM is much more sensitive than SD1 and SD2 to the underlying temporal structure of the data (Fig. 4.4). This supports the mathematical deﬁnition of CCM as a sensitive measure of temporal variation of the signal. The little variation in ΔCCM value shows that different temporal position of changes in temporal structure does not impact the CCM value, which means the homogeneity of CCM over time. Hence, CCM reﬂects changes in temporal structure of the signal irrespective of the time.

4.5.1.3 Examining the Inﬂuence of Various lags of Poincare´ Plot
One of the variations commonly used in order to optimize the use of the Poincare´ plot as a quantitative tool is the lagged Poincare´ plot [112, 136]. In several studies, it is also reported that the use of quantitative tool on multiple lagged Poincare´ plot might be useful to distinguish normal from pathological heart rate signal [131, 132, 136]. Therefore, analysis of lag response might give a comprehensive idea about the use of CCM, as a new quantitative tool, in different physiological conditions.
To quantify the inﬂuence of various lags of Poincare´ plot on SD1, SD2 and CCM, values of all descriptors were calculated for different time delays or lags (m was varied in increments from 1 to 100). At each step, lag-m Poincare´ plot was constructed and then SD1, SD2 and CCM values were calculated for the plot.
The relationship of CCM, SD1 and SD2 with different lags (m was varied from 1 to 100) is shown in Fig. 4.5. A unit lag is used to create the Poincare´ plot which conﬁrms the maximum linear correlation among data points. This lag selection may have obscured the low-level nonlinearities of the signal and as a result CCM may be unable to show better performance over standard poincare´ descriptors. In contrast, at higher lags, the standard descriptors are unable to capture the system dynamics. It is also established in the literature that studying behaviour of descriptors as a function of lags is more informative [132]. In our analysis, we have found that over different lags, CCM shows more variability than SD1 and SD2. Among the three descriptors the change in values for CCM was higher than both SD1 and SD2 which again supports our claim of sensitivity of CCM with signal dynamics. Hence, we conclude that the change in underlying temporal structure due to lag of the Poincare´ plot has higher impact on CCM than the traditional descriptors.

4.6 Physiological Relevance of CCM with Cardiovascular System

4.6 Physiological Relevance of CCM with Cardiovascular System

In this chapter, we demonstrate the physiological signiﬁcance of the novel measure CCM by analysing the effects of perturbations of autonomic function on Poincare´ plot descriptors (SD1 and SD2) in HRV signal of young healthy human subjects caused by the 70◦ head-up tilt test, atropine infusion and transdermal scopolamine patch administration. A surrogate analysis is also performed on the data to show that changes found in different phases of the activity are due to perturbed autonomic activity rather than noise.

4.6.1 Subjects and Study Design
In this analysis, ﬁve subjects were studied with normal sinus rhythm, who did not smoke, had no cardiovascular abnormalities and were not taking any medications. Subjects were aged between 20 and 40 years (30.2 ± 7.2 years). All studies were performed at the same time of the day without any disturbances. No respiration control was performed because all phases of the study were conducted in the resting state. An intravenous cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein and subjects then rested 20 min before commencement of data collection. The length of the study varied from 10 to 20 min. For autonomic perturbations the following sequence of protocol was performed. At least 20 min was allowed between each phase to permit the heart rate to return to baseline. Details of the study design and data collection were published in [94]. The sequence of phases was maintained strictly as follows:
Baseline Study
All baseline studies were conducted in subjects in the post-absorptive state after resting for 10 min in the supine position.
Seventy Degree Head-Up Tilt
Data were collected after subjects were tilted 70◦ on a motorized table. This manoeuvre increases sympathetic and decreases parasympathetic nervous system activity [137]. To permit the heart rate to stabilize at new position, data were collected 5 min after the subjects were tilted.

58

4 Poincare´ Plot in Capturing Nonlinear Temporal Dynamics of HRV

Atropine Infusion
Atropine sulphate (1.2 mg) was added to 50 ml of 5 intravenous dextrose and infused at a rate of 0.12 mg/min for 5 min and then at a rate of 0.24 mg/min until completion of this phase of study. Use of this dose regimen reduces parasympathetic nervous system activity signiﬁcantly [138]. After 10 min of infusion of atropine, the data collection started.

Transdermal Scopolamine
One week after the above studies, a low-dose transdermal scopolamine patch (hyoscine 1.5 mg) was applied overnight to an undamaged hair-free area of the skin behind the ear. The patch remained in situ for the duration of this period of the study. La Rovere et al. have shown that low-dose transdermal scopolamine increases parasympathetic nervous system activity [139].

4.6.2 Results
The RR intervals and the corresponding Poincare´ plot for all four phases of the experiment with the same subject are shown in Fig. 4.6. From Fig. 4.6 it is eminent that the atropine infusion strongly reduces the size of plot by reducing both the RR interval (increase in heart rate) and its variation. Whereas, the head-up tilt position reduces the RR interval (increase in heart rate) variability markedly with respect to the baseline. In contrast, use of low-dose transdermal scopolamine increases the RR interval (reduces heart rate) and its variability resulted into a wider Poincare´ plot in terms of width in both directions (perpendicular to line of identity and along the line of identity).
The mean and standard deviation of heart rate variability features of all subjects in all four phases are summarized in Table 4.1. Short-term variability (SD1) was increased in scopolamine phase and decreased in atropine phase. A similar trend was also found for long-term variability (SD2). Changes of SD1 values from phase to phase were much higher than that of SD2. CCM value was also minimum in atropine phase and maximum at scopolamine phase. Changes in mean values of CCM between study phases were higher than both SD1 and SD2 (Table 4.1). Moreover, changes in CCM values in atropine, 70◦ head-up tilt and scopolamine phases from baseline are found signiﬁcant (p < 0.01). Whereas, SD1 values were signiﬁcantly different in atropine and 70◦ Head-up tilt phases and SD2 values only in atropine phase.
The errorbars of log-scaled SD1, SD2 and CCM values for four groups of subjects are shown in Fig. 4.7. The atropine administration resulted into reduction in mean value of SD1 (SD of ΔRR) all subjects which was also reported by Kamen et al. [94]. The similar effect was also found for SD2 and CCM. The use of scopolamine patch increased both the width and height of the Poincare´ plot which resulted in the

increase in mean values of CCM as well as SD1 and SD2. All subjects have shown a marked reduction in SD1, SD2 and CCM values in 70◦ head-up tilt phase compared
to the baseline.

4.6.3 Physiological Relevance of CCM
Quantitative Poincare´ plot analysis was used to assess the changes in HRV during parasympathetic blockade [111] and compared the results with power spectral analysis of HRV, which was the commonly used method in the measurement of sympathovagal interaction [13, 103, 111, 140]. It was also reported that Poincare´ analysis method can provide the heart rate dynamics that is not detected by the conventional time-domain methods [111]. The present quantitative analysis was performed to measure the instantaneous beat-to-beat variance of RR intervals (SD1), the long-term continuous variance of all RR intervals (SD2) and the variation in temporal structure of all RR intervals (CCM). Instantaneous changes in RR intervals are mediated by vagal efferent activity, because vagal effects on the sinus node are known to develop faster than sympathetically mediated effects [101, 124]. The maximum reduction in SD1 during atropine infusion compared to baseline values conﬁrms that SD1 quantiﬁes the vagal modulation of heart rate, which was also reported by Kamen et al. [94] and Tulppo et al. [111]. Similar reduction in CCM value could be observed (Table 4.1 and Fig. 4.7), which indicates that CCM might correlate the parasympathetic nervous system activity. The lowest value of CCM has also been found during atropine infusion which reduced the parasympathetic activity and reduces instantaneous changes in HRV signal. Moreover, signiﬁcant (p < 0.01) change in CCM values in all phases from baseline phase compared to SD1 and SD2 indicates that CCM is more sensitive to changes in parasympathetic activity (Table 4.1). On the contrary, changes in SD1 values are insigniﬁcant in 70◦ head-up tilt phase and changes in SD2 values are insigniﬁcant both in 70◦ head-up tilt and scopolamine phases.
Reciprocal changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity occur during head-up tilt phase. The RR interval decreases and the high-frequency power of RR intervals decreases during the head-up tilt phase as evidence of withdrawal

of vagal activity (decrease in parasympathetic activity) [104, 141, 142]. The shortterm variability measure of Poincare´ plot (SD1) also decreases and correlates with high-frequency power as reported by Kamen et al. [94]. In this study, SD1 value decreased during 70◦ head-up tilt phase compared to baseline, which supports the results reported by previous studies [94, 137]. The CCM value has also decreased in 70◦ head-up tilt phase compared to baseline, which indicates that CCM value is modulated by the vagal tone (parasympathetic activity). Therefore, changes in autonomic regulation caused by 70◦ head-up tilt phase resulted in concordant changes in the temporal structure of the Poincare´ plot of RR intervals.
The low-dose transdermal scopolamine patch may decrease heart rate by a paradoxical vagomimetic effect [139]. Delivery by transdermal patch substantially increases both baseline and reﬂexly augmented levels of cardiac parasympathetic activity over 24 h in normal subjects [143,144]. Both time-domain HRV (mean, SD) and frequency-domain HRV (high-frequency power) increased to a greater extent during administration of low-dose scopolamine, which indicates the increase in parasympathetic activity [139]. The increase in parasympathetic activity decreases the heart rate and increases the RR interval as well as instantaneous variance in the RR, as measured by SD1 of Poincare´ plot. The increased value of SD1 correlates with increase high-frequency power and supported by the previous study reported by Kamen et al. [94]. In this study, the variability in the temporal structure of the Poincare´ plot (measured as CCM) was also found to be increased with increase in parasympathetic activity during administration of low-dose scopolamine (Fig. 4.7, Table 4.1). The increase in CCM value indicates that it reﬂects the change in parasympathetic activity harmoniously.

4.7 Clinical Case Studies Using CCM of Poincare´ Plot
In order to validate the proposed measure “CCM” two case studies were conducted on RR interval data. The data from MIT-BIH Physionet database are [145] used in the analysis. The medical fraternity has utilized Poincare´ plot, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, for detecting and monitoring arrhythmia. Compared to arrhythmia, fewer attempts have been made to utilize Poincare´ plot to evaluate CHF. In this study, we have analysed the performance of CCM and compared it with that of SD1 and SD2 for recognizing both arrhythmia and CHF using HRV signals.

4.7.1 HRV Studies of Arrhythmia and Normal Sinus Rhythm
In this study, we have used 54 long-term ECG recordings of subjects in normal sinus rhythm (30 men, aged 28.5–76, and 24 women, aged 58–73) from Physionet Normal Sinus Rhythm database [145]. Furthermore, we have also used NHLBI-sponsored cardiac arrhythmia suppression trial (CAST) RR-Interval Sub-study database for the arrhythmia data set from Physionet. Subjects of CAST database had an acute

myocardial infarction (MI) within the preceding 2 years and 6 or more ventricular premature complexes (PVCs) per hour during a pre-treatment (qualifying) long-term ECG (Holter) recording. Those subjects enrolled within 90 days of the index MI were required to have left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 55 %, while those enrolled after this 90 day window were required to have an ejection fraction less than or equal to 40 %.
The database is divided into three different study groups, among which we have used the Encainide (e) group data sets for our study. From that group we have chosen 272 subjects belonging to subgroup baseline (no medication). The original long-term ECG recordings were digitized at 128 Hz, and the beat annotations were obtained by automated analysis with manual review and correction [145]. lag-1 Poincare´ plots were constructed for both normal and arrhythmia subjects and the new measure CCM was computed along with SD1 and SD2. The SD1 and SD2 were calculated to characterize the distribution of the plots, whereas CCM values were used for characterizing the temporal structure of the plots.
Figure 4.8a represents box-whiskers (BW) plot for log(SD1) and it is obvious that boxes (interquartile range) of normal and arrhythmia subjects are nonoverlapping. But the whiskers (upper quartile) of normal subjects completely overlap with the whiskers (lower quartile) of the arrhythmia subjects. In Fig. 4.8b, the BW plot of log(SD2) is shown and it is apparent that the BW of normal subjects completely overlapped with the whiskers (lower quartile) of the arrhythmia subjects. But the box of arrhythmia subjects is still non-overlapping with the whiskers (upper quartile) of the normal subjects. In Fig. 4.8c, the BW plot of log(CCM) is shown and it is obvious that both of them are non-overlapping and distinct.
The p values obtained from ANOVA analysis between two groups for SD1, SD2 and CCM are given in Table 4.2. Using ANOVA, for CCM, p = 6.28 × 10−18 is obtained, whereas for SD1 and SD2, it is 7.6 × 10−3 and 8.5 × 10−3, respectively. In case of p < 0.001 to be considered as signiﬁcant, only CCM would show the signiﬁcant difference between two groups which indicates that CCM is a better descriptor of HRV signal than SD1 and SD2 when comparing arrhythmia with normal sinus rhythm subjects.

4.7.2 HRV Studies of Congestive Heart Failure and Normal Sinus Rhythm
For this case study, we have used 29 long-term ECG recordings of subjects (aged 34 to 79) with CHF (NYHA classes I, II and III) from Physionet CHF database along with 54 ECG recordings of subjects with normal sinus rhythm as discussed earlier [145]. The same ECG acquisition with beat annotations was used as discussed in the previous case study. Similar to the previous case study, lag-1 Poincare´ plots were constructed for both normal and CHF subjects and the new descriptor CCM was computed as per traditional descriptors.

The values of the mean and the standard deviation for both types of subjects are shown in Table 4.3. Last row represents the p value obtained from ANOVA analysis between the two groups for SD1, SD2 and CCM. Though SD2 and CCM show similar difference between the mean of two subject groups, the standard deviation of CCM is lower which concentrates with the distribution of CCM values around mean comparing with that of SD2. The p value, obtained from ANOVA analysis for CCM (p = 9.07 × 10−14), shows more signiﬁcance than SD1 and SD2.

4.8 Critical Remarks on CCM
The main motivation for using Poincare´ plot is to visualize the variability of any time-series signal. In addition to this qualitative approach, we propose a novel quantitative measure, CCM, to extract underlying temporal dynamics in a Poincare´ plot. Surrogate analysis showed that the standard quantitative descriptors SD1 and SD2 were not as signiﬁcantly altered as did CCM, this is shown in Fig. 4.3. Both SD1 and SD2 are second-order statistical measures [112], which are used to quantify the dispersion of the signal perpendicular and along the line of identity, respectively. Moreover, SD1 and SD2 are functions of lag-m correlation of the signal for any m lag Poincare´ plot. In contrast, CCM is a function of multiple lag (m − 2, m − 1, m, m + 1, m + 2) correlations and hence, this measure was found to be sensitive to changes in temporal structure of the signal as shown in Fig. 4.3.
From the theoretical deﬁnition of CCM it is obvious that the correlation information measured in SD1 and SD2 is already present in CCM. But this does not mean that CCM is a derived measure from existing descriptors SD1 and SD2. Rather, CCM can be considered as an additional measure incorporating information obtained in SD1 and SD2 (as the lag-m correlation is also included in CCM measure). In a Poincare´ plot, it is expected that lag response is stronger at lower values of m and it attenuates with increasing values of m. This is due to the dependence of Poincare´ descriptors on autocorrelation functions. The autocorrelation function monotonically decreases with increasing lags and in case of RR interval time series,

In this study, we also found that all measured descriptors SD1, SD2 and CCM changed rapidly at lower lags and the values are stabilized with higher lag values (Fig. 4.5). Since CCM is also a function of the signals autocorrelations, it shows a

similar lag response to that shown by SD1 and SD2. Therefore, CCM may be used to study the lag response behaviour of any pathological condition in comparison with normal subjects or controls.
HRV measure is considered to be a better marker for increased risk of arrhythmic events than any other non-invasive measure [146, 147]. An earlier study has shown that Poincare´ plots exposed completely different 2D patterns in the case of arrhythmia subjects [148]. These abnormal medical conditions have complex patterns due to reduced autocorrelation of the RR intervals. Consequently due to the changes in autocorrelation, we have found that the variability measure using Poincare´ (SD1, SD2) was higher than normal subjects (shown in Table 4.2). Moreover, the ﬂuctuations of these variability measures were also very high in the case of arrhythmias. This may be due to different types of arrhythmia along with subjective variation of HRV. In arrhythmia subjects, CCM was found to be higher compared to NSR subjects, but the deviation due to subjective variation is much smaller than SD1 and SD2. As a result, CCM linearly separates these two groups of subjects which means that the effect of different types of arrhythmia and subjective variation are reduced while using CCM than other variability measures. Therefore, we may conclude that CCM is a better marker for recognizing arrhythmia than the traditional variability measures of Poincare´ plot.
In case study, we have also shown how the Poincare´ plot can be used to characterize CHF subjects from normal subjects using RR interval time series. Compared to SD2, SD1 and CCM values were found to be higher in CHF subjects. This ﬁnding might indicate that the short-term variation in HRV is higher in CHF subjects; however, the long-term variation is reduced. Since CCM captures the signal dynamics at short level (i.e, three points of the plot), it appears to be affected by short-term variation of the signal in CHF subjects. In the case of recognition of CHF subjects, although SD2 showed good results, CCM was found to be more signiﬁcant (Table 4.3).
So far the discussion indicates that CCM is an additional descriptor of Poincare´ plot along with SD1 and SD2. This also implies that CCM is a more consistent descriptor compared to SD1 and SD2. Considering the presented case studies, it is clear that neither SD1 nor SD2 alone can independently distinguish NSR subjects from CHF and arrhythmia subjects. However, in the same scenario, CCM has the ability to perform the classiﬁcation task independently. This justiﬁes the usefulness of the proposed descriptors as a feature in a pattern recognition scenario. Our primary motivation for detecting pathology with a novel descriptor like CCM

rather than by observing a visual pattern is achieved, as shown by the case studies described. Although we have not looked at the physiological interpretation of CCM, the following remarks are relevant. The Poincare´ plot reﬂects the autocorrelation structure through the visual pattern of the plot. The standard descriptors SD1 and SD2 summarize the correlation structure of RR interval data as shown by Brennan et al. [112]. CCM is based on the autocorrelation at different lags of the time series, hence giving an in-depth measurement of the correlation structure of the plot. Therefore, the value of CCM decreases with increased autocorrelation of the plot. In arrhythmia, the pattern of the Poincare´ plots becomes more complex [148], thus reducing the correlation of the signal (RRi, RRi+1). In case of healthy subjects the value of CCM is lower than that of arrhythmic subjects. In the future, the performance of CCM for other pathologies might be worth looking.

4.9 Conclusion
CCM is developed based on the limitation of standard descriptors SD1 and SD2. The analysis carried out conﬁrms the hypothesis that CCM measures the temporal variation of the Poincare´ plot. In contrast to the standard descriptors, CCM evaluates point-to-point variation of the signal instead of gross variability. CCM is more sensitive to changes in temporal variation of the signal and varies with different lags of Poincare´ plot. Besides the mathematical deﬁnition of CCM and analysing properties of the measure, CCM was found to be effective in the assessment of different physiological and pathological conditions.

Chapter 5
Heart Rate Asymmetry Analysis Using Poincare´ Plot

Abstract Physiological systems are inherently complex and subject to energy, entropy and information ﬂuxes across their boundaries. These systems function in disequilibrium in healthy condition and their self-organizing capability is related to asymmetricity of the underlying processes (Costa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95:1–4, 2005). In pathological perturbations, a loss of self-organizing capability associated with aging or disease is a function of loss of asymmetricity (Costa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95:1–4, 2005). Intuitively, asymmetry refers to the lack of symmetry; in other words, the distribution of signals is imbalanced. This imbalance or dissimilarity can easily be observed in geometry of the phase space plots. Asymmetry is expected to be present in physiological systems (Chialvo and Millonas, Phys. Rev. Lett. 209:26– 30, 1995) as it is the fundamental property of a non-equilibrium system (Prigogine and Antoniou, Ann. N. U. Acad. Sci. 879:8–28, 2007). Furthermore, asymmetry is linked with the time irreversibility, which is reported as highest in systems with healthy physiology (Costa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95:1–4, 2005; Costa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89:062102, 2002). Thus, asymmetry represents the presence of complex nonlinear dynamics in physiological signals. So far, very little work has been published in deﬁning and measuring asymmetry in physiological signals (Piskorski and Guzik, Phys. Rev. Lett. 28:287–300, 2007).

5.1 Introduction

Physiological systems are inherently complex and subject to energy, entropy and information ﬂuxes across their boundaries. These systems function in disequilibrium in healthy condition and their self-organizing capability is related to asymmetricity of the underlying processes [149]. In pathological perturbations, a loss of selforganizing capability associated with aging or disease is a function of loss of asymmetricity [149]. Intuitively, asymmetry refers to the lack of symmetry; in other words, the distribution of signals is imbalanced. This imbalance or dissimilarity can easily be observed in geometry of the phase space plots. Asymmetry is expected

to be present in physiological systems [150] as it is the fundamental property of a non-equilibrium system [151]. Furthermore, asymmetry is linked with the time irreversibility, which is reported as highest in systems with healthy physiology [149, 152]. Thus, asymmetry represents the presence of complex nonlinear dynamics in physiological signals. So far, very little work has been published in deﬁning and measuring asymmetry in physiological signals [153].
Heart rate variability (HRV), the variation of the time period between consecutive heartbeats, is thought to reﬂect the heart’s adaptability to the changing physiological conditions. HRV is a net effect of extrinsic regulation and intrinsic heart rhythm. It is however predominantly dependent on the extrinsic regulation of the heart rate [114]. The autonomic nervous system [sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS)] plays a major role in regulating heart rate. Sympathetic activity is responsible for increasing the heart rate while the parasympathetic activity lowers the heart rate. Both of them work concurrently to control the heart rate in a given range. In practice there is always some variability in heart rate, due to imbalances in the activity levels of SNS and PNS. Hence, any heart rate cannot increase or decrease indeﬁnitely but instead will be followed by an opposite trend. However, it is unlikely that any increase or decrease in RR interval has a reversing effect on the very next RR interval. The speed at which the heart rate increases or decreases is variable, which implies that the periods of increasing or decreasing RR interval are also not equal. As a result, heart rate asymmetry (HRA) should be a common phenomena present in a healthy heart, which is also reported by Piskorski and Guzik [153] and Porta et al. [154] and the main focus of this chapter.
An obvious phenomenon in a typical Poincare´ plot is asymmetry with respect to the line of identity (line with 45◦ slope and passes through the origin). Porta et al. have examined the asymmetry of Poincare´ plot and shown the interrelationship between time reversibility, pattern asymmetry and nonlinear dynamics [154]. While doing so, the authors have used three different indices, Guzik’s index (GI), Porta’s index (PI) and Ehlers’ index (EI) [155–157]. Guzik et al. [156] analysed the asymmetry of short-segment HRV signal (5 min) and extended to long segment (30 min) [153]. It has been reported that about 80 % of healthy subjects showed HRA. Since asymmetry is a phenomenon of a healthy physiological system [149,152], it is concluded that in a resting situation, the healthy heart should always exhibit the asymmetry.

5.2 Existing Indices of HRA
The traditional asymmetry indices used in previous studies are GI, PI and EI [154– 157] . For deﬁning all the indices, let us assume that the increasing cloud I and decreasing cloud D are a set of points as shown below, respectively:
M
I ≡ Pi(RRi, RRi+1)
i=1

and
K

where M and K represent the number of points in increasing and decreasing cloud.

5.2.1 Guzik’s Index

Guzik et al. have deﬁned the index for measuring the HRA using the Poincare´ plot [156]. For deﬁning GI, the distance of the plotted points from the line of identity is used. For ith point Pi(RRi, RRi+1) of the plot, the distance can be calculated as

where C(Pi+) gives the number of points above the line of identity. In the new deﬁnition of asymmetry, the line of identity is not used for grouping the plotted
points into two different clouds. As a result, it is not possible to calculate the new GI using Eq. 5.1. The set of points {Pi+} used in Eq. 5.1 is equivalent to the increasing cloud deﬁned in the new deﬁnition of asymmetry. Hence, using the increasing cloud
I, Eq. 5.1 can be redeﬁned using the proposed deﬁnition:

GIp

(5.2)

where the numerator corresponds to the increasing cloud, the denominator corresponds to the total number of points and GIp is the redeﬁned Guzik’s index.

5.2.2 Porta’s Index
Porta et al. have also deﬁned the asymmetry with respect to the line of identity [155]. Rather than considering the relative distance of the points with respect to the line of identity, the authors have assessed asymmetry by evaluating the number of points

72

According to the proposed deﬁnition, the set of points Pi− is equivalent to the set of points belonging to the decreasing cloud D. Hence, Eq. 5.3 can be redeﬁned as:

where K and M are the number of points in cloud D and I, respectively.

5.2.3 Ehlers’ Index

Ehler et al. have used the ﬁrst derivative of the RR interval series for assessing asymmetry of the given distribution [157]. Skewness is measured over the ﬁrst derivative signal to estimate the asymmetry of the distribution. Hence, for RR interval time series, it can be deﬁned as

Normalization of Indices
For the sake of comparison, normalization of the indices to a convenient scale is recommended. Both GI and PI values range between 0 and 100, with the index value of symmetry S = 50. Asymmetricity of the signal is ranked based on the difference

5.3 New Deﬁnition of Asymmetry in RR Interval Time Series

73

of the index value from S. Index value > 50 represents that the distribution is positively skewed, either by the magnitude or by the number of points, whereas index value < 50 corresponds to the reverse distribution. The symmetricity in EI (EI ∈ [−1, 1]) is characterized as S = 0 and values > 0 or < 0 rank the asymmetricity of the signal. Therefore, to compare EI with GI and PI, it is necessary to use a normalized scale for the index value calculated. In this study, we have deﬁned a range, R, for the index values to deﬁne asymmetricity. The range is deﬁned as 1% of the difference between minimum and maximum index values, where index is either GI, PI or EI. Now, if index ∈ (S ± R) then the signal is symmetric, otherwise asymmetric. The redeﬁned indices (GIp, PIp and EIp) are also normalized in the same manner.

5.3 New Deﬁnition of Asymmetry in RR Interval Time Series
The line of identity in Poincare´ plot is deﬁned as the line that passes through the origin at an angle of 45◦ with x-axis. Therefore, any point P(x, y) on the line of identity can be expressed as x = y. Brennan et al. have deﬁned the line of identity and shown that SD1 is the standard deviation perpendicular to the line of identity and SD2 is the standard deviation of plotted points along the line of identity [112]. But the mathematical formulation given for SD1 and SD2 by Brennan et al. [112] does not comply with the concept of line of identity which is shown by Piskorski and Guzik [153]. Piskorski and Guzik have also shown that the line of identity deﬁned by Brennan et al. [112] is a line, which actually passes through the moment of inertia or centroid of the plotted data points with slope of 45◦ [153]. The authors have named that line as l1 and showed the difference in calculation of SD1 and SD2 with respect to the line of identity and l1 (Fig. 5.1). The standard descriptors calculated with respect to the line of identity and l1 show negligible difference. As the line of identity has a special criteria x = y, Piskorski et al. suggested that the line of identity will be the best option for measuring SD1 and SD2. In our work, we have followed Piskorski and Guzik [153] in deﬁning the line of identity.
The asymmetry indices GI and PI are deﬁned based on the asymmetry deﬁnition by Piskorski and Guzik [153]. On the other hand, EI does not depend on any speciﬁc deﬁnition of asymmetry. It is directly calculated from the time-series information by computing skewness of the ﬁrst derivative of the signal, i.e. the points of the Poincare´ plot are not necessarily divided into two groups (increasing and decreasing). The details for calculating all indices are given in Sect. 5.4. In [153], asymmetry is deﬁned with respect to the line of identity. All points on the line of identity (x = y) have equal consecutive RR intervals. Hence, any point above the line of identity corresponds to increasing RR interval (i.e. decreasing heart rate) and any point below corresponds to decreasing RR interval (i.e. increasing heart rate). Based on this, asymmetry is deﬁned and quantiﬁed using different indices. Moreover, this HRA can visually be observed as the clouds of points above and below the line of identity. In healthy condition, the heart shows continuous short-term variability

owing to SNS and PNS activities, which impacts on the formation of cloud around

the line of identity. However, this deﬁnition of asymmetry does not represent true

increasing or decreasing pattern in the heart rate. To overcome this problem, we

have deﬁned the asymmetry of heart rate in Poincare´ plot independent of the line of

identity, i.e. decision about a point whether it is increasing or decreasing is not made

based on its position with respect to line of identity on the 2D Poincare´ map. In the

proposed deﬁnition, the cloud of points is partitioned into three parts: (1) points

belonging to the increasing pattern of RR interval (I); (2) points belonging to the

decreasing pattern of RR interval (D); and (3) points belonging to the stable pattern

in RR interval (N). The decision about a point as to whether it belongs to one of the

above three classes is made based on the neighbouring point in the Poincare´ plot.

Therefore, the analysis corresponds to at least three consecutive RR intervals of the

RR interval time series for lag-1 Poincare´ plot. Let the vector RR be deﬁned as

RR ≡ {RR1, RR2, RR3, . . . , RRN} where RRi is the ith RR interval and N is the total

number of RR intervals. Furthermore, let P, the set of all points in a lag-1 Poincare´

plot, be deﬁned as P ≡

For any two points Pi(RRi, RRi+1) and Pi+1(RRi+1, RRi+2) of the Poincare´ plot,

which involves three RR intervals {RRi, RRi+1, RRi+2}, the status of the point Pi+1

with respect to clouds of points is deﬁned as:

After deﬁning the clouds, the asymmetry is deﬁned between the points of I and D, i.e. the asymmetry is deﬁned as the lack of symmetry among the distribution of points in I and D. Hence, any point belonging to cloud N is not considered for calculating asymmetry. According to this deﬁnition, it is possible to ﬁnd points I or D on both sides of the line of identity as shown in Fig. 5.2. Examples of the proposed deﬁnition with the RR intervals series shown in Fig. 5.2 are given in Fig. 5.3.

5.4 Modiﬁed HRA Indices Using Poincare´ Plot
In this section, the asymmetry indices are redeﬁned in accordance with the proposed deﬁnition of asymmetry. For redeﬁning all the indices, let us assume that the increasing cloud I and decreasing cloud D are a set of points as shown below, respectively:

5.4.1 Guzik’s Index (GIp)

In the new deﬁnition of asymmetry, the line of identity is not used for grouping the
plotted points into two different clouds. As a result, it is not possible to calculate the new GI using Eq. 5.1. The set of points {Pi+} used in Eq. 5.1 is equivalent to the increasing cloud deﬁned in the new deﬁnition of asymmetry. Hence, using the
increasing cloud I, Eq. 5.1 can be redeﬁned using the proposed deﬁnition:

GIp

where the numerator corresponds to the increasing cloud, the denominator corresponds to the total number of points and GIp is the redeﬁned Guzik’s index.

One important hypothesis about the HRA is that in resting condition a healthy heart should exhibit asymmetricity. In this section we have tested this hypothesis using both existing and redeﬁned HRA indices.
5.5.1.1 Data and Results
In order to validate the new deﬁnition of asymmetry, GI, PI and EI using Guzik’s deﬁnition and GIp, PIp and EIp using the proposed deﬁnition of asymmetry are calculated for RR interval data of short segment (5 min) and long segment (30 min)

which belongs to short-term HRV analysis [55]. The data from MIT-BIH Physionet database are used in this analysis [145]. RR intervals of 54 subjects with normal sinus rhythm (30 men, aged 28.5–76, and 24 women, aged 58–73) have been used from the Physionet Normal Sinus Rhythm database [145] for evaluating the proposed deﬁnition. Hence we had 54 sets of recordings, of which the ﬁrst 5 and 30 min were used for short- and long-segment analysis, respectively. The original long term ECG recordings were digitized at 128 Hz, and the beat annotations were obtained by automated analysis with manual review and correction [145]. The shortand long-segment RR interval series were taken from the beginning of each subject’s RR interval, but the time of the day or night cannot be mentioned as it was not clearly stated in the Physionet database. Details about the RR interval time series can be found in [158].
The GI values for short-segment (panels a and b) and long-segment (panel, c and d) RR interval time series are shown in Fig. 5.4. Top panel (a and c) of Fig. 5.4 represents the GI values. For short segment, 61.11 % of the subjects are found to be

asymmetric, GI ∈ (49, 51), with GI values 52.37 ± 5.72 (mean ± sd). Furthermore, 53.74 % of the subjects are found to be asymmetric, GI ∈ (49, 51), with GI values 52.18 ± 4.13 for long-segment study. The presence of asymmetry using Guzik’s deﬁnition is not consistent and the reason for this is reported as unknown [156].
The GIp values for both short- and long-segment RR interval signals are shown in the bottom panel (b and d) of Fig. 5.4. In the short-segment case, the GIp values range within 44.72 ± 11.12 and 79.63 % of the subjects are found to be asymmetric. In addition, 81.48 % of subjects showed asymmetry for long-segment signal with GIp values 45.81 ± 6.56. This shows signiﬁcant improvement in consistency of GIp for deﬁning asymmetry using proposed deﬁnition in contrast to Guzik’s asymmetry
deﬁnition.
In Fig. 5.5, PI and PIp values for short-segment (panel a and b) and long segment (panels c and d) RR interval time series are shown. Top panel (a and c) represents
the PI values, whereas the bottom panel (b and d) shows PIp values. For shortsegment signal 61.11 % subjects showed asymmetry, PI ∈/ (49, 51), with PI values 50.11 ± 2.63, whereas 53.70 % of subjects showed asymmetry, PIp ∈/ (49, 51), with PIp values 49.94 ± 2.12 in accordance to the proposed deﬁnition. In case of longsegment variability, 40.74 % of subjects showed asymmetry with PI values 50.65 ± 1.94. On the other hand, 31.48 % of subjects showed asymmetry with PIp values 50.27 ± 1.47.
Figure 5.6 shows the values of asymmetry index EI; 50 % of the subjects with EI values 0.0290 ± 0.0711 are found asymmetric in case of short-segment signal with Guzik’s deﬁnition of asymmetry. On the other hand, 94.44 % of the subjects are screened asymmetric using the proposed deﬁnition with EIp values −0.1979 ± 0.2344. Similarly, for long-segment signal, 20.37 % subjects are found asymmetric with EI values 0.0145 ± 0.0331 using Guzik’s deﬁnition. However, 85.19 % subjects are screened asymmetric with EIp values −0.1909 ± 0.2053. Table 5.1 shows mean and standard deviations of values of all indices, and asymmetry subjects (%) for
both short- and long-segment signals are given.

5.5.1.2 Discussion
Asymmetry is related with nonlinear dynamics and time irreversibility, which exhibit the most complex interrelationships [149, 152]. It is reported to be highest for healthy physiological systems under resting conditions [149] and decreases with pathology, thus providing a marker for any loss of normal functionality. Guzik et al. [156] have reported that the asymmetry in HRV might be related to the response of the baroreﬂex to increase or decrease the blood pressure [159]. However, exact reason for such asymmetry is largely unknown.
In this study, a novel way for deﬁning asymmetry of RR interval time series in Poincare´ plot has been presented. Two merits of the novel deﬁnition are: (1) It is correctly deﬁned from geometrical point of view because it considers pattern rather than a single point of the Poincare´ plot to categorize a point either as increasing, decreasing or stable; (2) It captures HRA of healthy subjects using existing

asymmetry indices at higher prevalence than that deﬁned by Guzik et al. [156]. Though Guzik’s deﬁnition of asymmetry is very simple and intuitive, using such a deﬁnition may not be physiologically correct. For instance, it is known that HRV signal of normal resting subjects should be asymmetric as reported by Piskorski and Guzik [153] and Costa et al. [149]. In our study, using Guzik’s deﬁnition, only 62% of such subjects showed asymmetry, whereas the new deﬁnition showed asymmetry in more than 94 % of the subjects. Also, the regulation of heart rate in resting subjects is not instantaneous but takes a couple of seconds [159]. In such a case, it is important to measure the pattern of changes in heart rate rather than instantaneous effect. Therefore, the consideration of instantaneous changes could be a major limitation of the existing deﬁnition. As a result, use of patterns in the proposed deﬁnition, rather than instantaneous changes, reveals much higher incidence of asymmetry in healthy subjects.

This analysis exploits the physiological phenomena of the system to deﬁne the asymmetry in the signal. Important ﬁndings of this study are: (a) Existing asymmetry indices are more sensitive to capture asymmetricity with the proposed deﬁnition of asymmetry than the existing deﬁnition (Figs. 5.4–5.6, Table 5.1). (b) GI and EI capture the asymmetricity better than the PI; i.e. for both deﬁnitions, use of location of points in the 2D map with respect to the line of identity for calculating the indices performs better than using only the information about the number of points in the distribution (Figs. 5.4–5.6, Table 5.1). Furthermore, the asymmetricity has been calculated for subjects with normal sinus rhythm using both deﬁnitions. The results are in accordance with the reported asymmetry in HRV [149, 154–156]. In this analysis, we have found that 79.63 % and 81.48 % of subjects are shown to be asymmetric using the proposed deﬁnition compared to 61.11 % and 53.74 % of subjects with Guzik’s deﬁnition for short-segment and long-segment signals, respectively (Fig. 5.4).
However, other than the deﬁnition of HRA, the index calculated by Piskorski and Guzik [153] and Porta et al. [154] was also different than the way we have calculated in this study. We have used the bidirectional and normalization criteria (as discussed in Sect. 5.2.3) to compare among different indices popularly used for asymmetry measurement. Moreover, if we used the same asymmetry measure as used by Piskorski and Guzik [153], then it would be 48.15 % and 40.74 % for short and long segment, respectively, in our results. Hence, use of bidirectional criteria for deﬁning asymmetry has increased the prevalence of having asymmetry. However, the intention of using bidirectional criterion has been supported by the time reversibility or asymmetry theory. In reference to the result published by Piskorski and Guzik [153], the 81 % or 82 % subjects showing asymmetry can not be comparable to this study as the data set used in their study was different. In this study, only 61.11 % and 53.74 % of subjects were showing asymmetry using Guzik’s deﬁnition with bidirectional and normalization criteria for short and long segment, respectively.
Using Guzik’s deﬁnition and Porta’s index (PI), 61.11 % of the subjects are classiﬁed as having asymmetry in case of short-segment signal and 40.74 % in the case of long-segment signal, in contrast to the ﬁndings reported in [155]. However, using the new deﬁnition, PIp was reduced to 53.70 % and 31.48 % for short-segment and long-segment signals, respectively. The reason behind the reduced performance of PIp against PI is the difference of the number of points used for calculating the index. If we observe the two deﬁnitions closely, there is hardly any difference in the number of points in the increasing and decreasing clouds. Hence similar numbers were expected. The use of the number of points has been shown by Porta et al. to work well in certain conditions like foetal heart rate monitoring [155]. In this study, we did not ﬁnd any speciﬁc advantage with Porta’s index. This justiﬁcation is strongly supported by the result obtained using EIp, which showed 94.44 % and 85.19 % of subjects having asymmetry for both short-segment and long-segment signals, using the new deﬁnition. In contrast, 50.00 % and 20.37 % of subjects are found to be asymmetric using Guzik’s deﬁnition for the short-segment and longsegment signals, respectively. Therefore, we conﬁrm that our deﬁnition performs better in quantifying asymmetry using existing indices than the previous ones.

5.5 Application of HRA in Clinical Research

83

Piskorski and Guzik [153] performed surrogate analysis to show that HRA is related to some unknown underlying dynamics rather than a random behaviour and showed that the presence of asymmetry or the time reversibility is abolished in randomized HRV signal. Piskorski and Guzik [153] used random shufﬂing surrogate method, in which the signals were randomly shufﬂed so that the probability of distribution remained the same but the temporal correlations were destroyed [160, 161]. However, nonlinear measurement is not necessarily be affected by such surrogation [162]. The discrimination, by any measure either linear or nonlinear, of the original time series from this type of surrogation only suggests the presence of hidden correlation in the original time series. Therefore, we conclude that the effect of surrogation does not have a speciﬁc impact on nonlinear properties like asymmetry or time reversibility. However, it has impact on asymmetricity measured with respect to line of identity, because the correlation of the signal changes with surrogation and it affects the distribution of points in Poincare´ plot around the line of identity. Therefore, results of surrogate analysis have no affect on this proposed deﬁnition.

5.5.2 Correlation Between HRA and Parasympathetic Activity
In this section we assess the changes in HRA in experimental conditions using Poincare´ plot during parasympathetic blockade (atropine infusion) and parasympathetic enhancement (scopolamine administration). The correlations between HRA and the frequency-domain parameters are also analysed to better explain the changes in HRA with respect to PNS activity.
5.5.2.1 Clinical Study Methodology
Eight subjects with normal sinus rhythm, non-smokers, without cardiovascular abnormalities and who were not taking any medications were studied. Subjects were aged between 20 and 40 years (30.5 ± 7.3).
All recordings were performed at the same time of the day without any disturbances. No respiration control was performed because all phases of the study were conducted in the resting state. An intravenous cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein and subjects then rested 20 min before recording of data. The length of the study varies from 10 to 20 min. For autonomic perturbations the following sequence of protocol was performed. At least 20 min was allowed between each phase to permit the heart rate to return to baseline. Details of the study design and data collection are reported by Kamen et al. [94] and the sequence of phases was maintained strictly as follows:

84

5 Heart Rate Asymmetry Analysis Using Poincare´ Plot

Baseline Study
All baseline studies were conducted in subjects in the post-absorptive state after resting for 10 min in the supine position.

Atropine Infusion
Atropine sulphate (1.2 mg) was added to 50 ml intravenous dextrose and infused at a rate of 0.12 mg/min for 5 min and then at a rate of 0.24 mg/min until completion of this phase of study. Use of this dose regimen reduces PNS activity signiﬁcantly [138]. After 10 min of infusion of atropine, the data collection started.

Transdermal Scopolamine
One week after the above studies, a low-dose transdermal scopolamine patch (hyoscine 1.5 mg) was applied overnight to an undamaged hair-free area of the skin behind the ear. The patch remained in situ for the duration of this period of study. It has been shown in [139] that low-dose transdermal scopolamine increases PNS activity.

5.5.2.2 Deviation from Symmetry Distsym
Deviation of the asymmetry index (GIp) from symmetric range of the index is deﬁned as Distsym. For ith subject Distsym is calculated as
Distsym = |GIp(i) − GIp(sym)|
where GIp(sym) is the index value for symmetric range and deﬁned as
GIp(sym) = 49, GIp(i) < 49 GIp(sym) = 51, GIp(i) > 51 GIp(sym) = GIp, otherwise
Finally, Distsym = 0 indicates the absence of HRA, whereas Distsym > 0 indicates presence of HRA.

5.5.2.3 Power Spectral Analysis
The HRV time series was generated as a function of heartbeats and the resulting interval tachogram is thus a series of RR intervals plotted as a function of the interval number. In this study we have used the MATLAB R2009b implementation of Welch’s method for calculating power spectrum density (PSD). In this method the

5.5 Application of HRA in Clinical Research

85

data are zero-padded to length of the FFT and divided into overlapping segments. The PSD of each segment is computed and the PSD estimates are averaged out, which is the result of the power spectral analysis. This averaging decreases the variance of the estimate relative to a single periodogram estimate of the entire data record [163]. We have used FFT length of 128 data points which is divided into eight segments with 50 % overlap between them. The resultant PSD vector length is 65 which also represents the number of frequency bin. The resolution of each bin is 1/128 (i.e. 0.0078 cycles/interval). In order to express the result in true frequency domain (Hz), the spectral units are then divided by the mean RR interval as discussed in [94].

5.5.2.4 Statistics
MATLAB statistics toolbox was used to perform a Spearman nonparametric correlation coefﬁcient [164] analysis between frequency-domain features (LF, HF and LF/HF) and HRA index GIp. The coefﬁcient is signiﬁed by R (rho), and can take on the values from −1.0 to 1.0, where −1.0 is a perfect negative (inverse) correlation, 0.0 is no correlation and 1.0 is a perfect positive correlation.

5.5.2.5 Results from HRA Analysis
RR intervals and corresponding Poincare´ plots of all three phases of studies are shown in Fig. 5.7. Results of power spectral analysis of HRV signal of all subjects for all phases of study are summarized in Table 5.2. Subjects displayed a marked reduction both in low-frequency power (0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (> 0.15 Hz) power during atropine infusion. In contrast, LF/HF (ratio between low-frequency and high-frequency power) increased signiﬁcantly during this phase. Moreover, only 5 out of 8 subjects are found to be asymmetric which is lower than the total number of subjects (7 out of 8) found asymmetric during baseline phase. On the other hand, all eight subjects are screened asymmetric during scopolamine phase.
The HRA index values of all subjects for all three phases of the study are plotted in Fig. 5.8. The dotted lines represent the range of HRA index value that is considered symmetric. In this analysis, we have used the HRA index value 49 ≤ GIp ≤ 51 as symmetric as suggested in our previous study [165]. The HRA index GIp during atropine infusion phase shows that 3 out of 8 subjects lie inside the symmetric range (panel a, Fig. 5.8). On the other hand, GIp value of only 1 out of 8 subject lies inside the symmetric range in baseline phase (panel b, Fig. 5.8). It is interesting to discover that all subjects lie outside the symmetric range in scopolamine administration phase (panel c, Fig. 5.8). This indicates that the HRA reduces in the subjects during atropine infusion, whereas it increases in scopolamine administration.
