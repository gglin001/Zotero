1. Introducing HRV Live!
Most known existing HRV measurement tools available at this time have the capability to measure short‐term HR data and provide further static assessment. Each assessment provides information on what happened at a certain point in time without any consideration for the dynamics of physiological changes reflected in HRV. HRV Live! represents a new approach in HRV evaluation that is performed repetitively and continuously over extended periods of time. A standard 5‐minute time window is used for such HRV evaluation, which is continuously updated every half a second. A robust method of real‐time HR data evaluation and artifact detection is implemented to ensure reliability of HRV data. The use of a new auto‐regression method of power spectrum calculation allows for a fast and reliable early detection of transitory processes caused by various interventions. This tool is especially effective when a variety of effects are examined. For example, when performing tests for specific allergies or toxins, various substances have to be tested with regard to what kind of autonomic response they create. Having ability to detect sudden changes in autonomic balance provides an opportunity to reliably detect agents that cause such allergic reactions by means of affecting the autonomic balance. When monitoring HRV changes, multiple time markers can be posted along with recorded data. When HRV data is reviewed, multiple comparisons of the data associated with those time markers can be performed.

2. Scientific Background
2.1. Physiological Basics
The origin of heartbeat is located in a sino‐atrial (SA) node of the heart, where a group of specialized cells continuously generates an electrical impulse spreading all over the heart muscle through specialized pathways and creating process of heart muscle contraction well synchronized between both atriums and ventricles. The SA node generates such impulses about 100 – 120 times per minute at rest. However, in a healthy individual, the resting heart rate (HR) would never be that high. This is due to continuous control of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) over the output of SA node activity. Its net regulatory effect gives real HR. In a healthy subject at rest, it ranges between 60 and 80 beats per minute.
Fig. 2.1. Phases of electrical impulse propagation The autonomic nervous system is a part of the nervous system that non‐voluntarily controls all organs and systems of the body. As the other part of nervous system ANS has its central (nuclei located in brain stem) and peripheral components (afferent and efferent fibers and peripheral ganglia) accessing all internal organs. There are two branches of the autonomic nervous system ‐ sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) nervous systems that always work as antagonists in their effect on target organs. For most organs including heart, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates organ’s functioning. An increase in sympathetic stimulation causes an increase in HR, stroke volume, systemic vasoconstriction, etc. In contrast, the parasympathetic nervous system inhibits functioning of those organs. An increase in parasympathetic stimulation causes a decrease in HR, stroke volume, systemic vasodilatation, etc.
Scientific Background ‐9‐

Biocom HRV Live! User’s Manual
Fig. 2.2. Autonomic nervous system chart A heart response time to sympathetic stimulation is relatively slow. It takes about 5 seconds to increase HR after actual onset of sympathetic stimulation and almost 30 seconds to reach its peak steady level. The heart’s response to parasympathetic stimulation is almost instantaneous. Depending on actual phase of heart cycle, it takes just 1 or 2 heartbeats before heart slows down to its minimum proportional to the level of stimulation. At rest, both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are active with parasympathetic dominance. The actual balance between them is constantly changing in attempt to achieve optimum considering all internal and external stimuli. There are various factors affecting autonomic regulation of the heart, including but not limited to respiration, thermoregulation, humoral regulation (rennin‐angiotensin system), blood pressure, cardiac output, etc. One of the most important factors is blood pressure. There are special baroreceptive cells in the hear and large blood vessels that sense blood pressure level and send afferent stimulation to central structures of the ANS that control HR and blood vessel tonus primarily through sympathetic and somewhat parasympathetic systems forming continuous feedback dedicated to maintain systemic blood pressure. This mechanism is also called baroreflex, which
Scientific Background ‐ 10 ‐

Biocom HRV Live! User’s Manual
increases HR when blood pressure decreases and vice versa. This mechanism is also targeted to maintain optimal cardiac output.
Fig. 2.3. Autonomic regulation of the heart rate
2.2. HRV Analysis
The heart rate variability analysis is a powerful tool in assessment of the autonomic function. It is an accurate, reliable, reproducible, yet simple to measure and process. The source information for HRV is a continuous beat‐by‐beat measurement of interbeat intervals. The electrocardiograph (ECG or EKG) is considered as the best way to measure interbeat intervals. ECG is an electrical signal measured with special conductive electrodes placed on chest around heart area or limbs. It reflects minute changes in electrical field generated by heart muscle cells originating from its SA node. ECG signal has a very specific and robust waveform simple to detect and analyze. Because of that cardiac rhythm derived from ECG is the best way to detect not only true sinus rhythm but all types of ectopic heartbeats, which must be excluded from consideration of HRV analysis.
Scientific Background ‐ 11 ‐

Biocom HRV Live! User’s Manual
Fig. 2.4. Normal heartbeat interval detection The other approach to measuring cardiac intervals is a measurement of pulse wave. It is a less invasive and simple method of measurement based on photoplethysmograph (PPG). PPG is a signal reflecting changes in a blood flow detected when infrared light is emitted towards microcirculatory blood vessels. Depending on blood flow volume certain portion of that light is absorbed letting other part to pass or b reflected. An optical sensor detects a quantity of light passed (or reflected from) the blood flow producing a waveform identifying pulse wave. Such waveform can also be processed to derive beat‐by‐beat interbeat intervals. Although PPG gives the summary information reflecting both cardiac and blood vessel components of HRV, some research studies showed a significantly high correlation between interbeat interval data measured by both ECG and PPG in short‐term steady‐state recordings. One of the important issues when measuring either ECG or PPG is the absence of abnormal heartbeat used in interval detection. Only heartbeats originated in SA node can be processed to obtain HRV data. Whether there are ectopic heartbeats (PVCs or other types of extrasystolic heartbeats) or various movement artifacts on ECG (or PPG) considered as heartbeats, they must be excluded from consideration. There are various statistically‐based algorithms of detection of such abnormal heartbeats that minimize chances to get contaminated HR recordings. Nevertheless, for the sake of accuracy in HRV analysis it is important to be able to visually verify all heartbeats automatically found, remove abnormal ones and include missing.

2.3. Clinical Significance of HRV
It is found that lowered HRV is associated with aging, decreased autonomic activity, hormonal tonus, specific types of autonomic neuropathies (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) and increased risk of sudden cardiac death after acute MI. Other research indicated that depression, panic disorders and anxiety have negative impact on autonomic function, typically causing depletion of parasympathetic tonus. On the other hand an increased sympathetic tonus is associated with lowered threshold of ventricular fibrillation. These two factors could explain why such autonomic imbalance caused by significant mental and emotional stress increases risk of acute MI followed by sudden cardiac death. Aside from that, there are multiple studies indicating that HRV is quite useful as a way to quantitatively measure physiological changes caused by various interventions both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological during treatment of many pathological conditions having significant manifestation of lowered HRV. However it is important to realize that clinical implication of HRV analysis has been clearly recognized in only two medical conditions:
1. Predictor of risk of arrhythmic events or sudden cardiac death after acute MI. 2. Clinical marker of diabetic neuropathy evolution.
Nevertheless, as the number of clinical studies involving HRV in various clinical aspects and conditions grows, HRV remains one of the most promising methods of investigating general health in the future.

2.4. Methods of HRV Analysis
Short‐term HRV analysis requires much shorter recordings – typically 5‐min long. However such recordings are assumed to be done at steady‐state physiological condition and should be properly standardized to produce comparable data. Typically, such measurements should be done in either supine or comfortably sitting relaxed position, limiting body movements, conversations, any mental activities.
According to the standards set forth by the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology in 1996, there are two methods of analysis of HRV data: time‐ and frequency‐domain analysis. In either method, the interbeat intervals should be properly calculated and any abnormal heartbeats found.
2.4.1. Time‐Domain HRV
Time‐domain measures are the simplest parameters to be calculated. Before such calculation, all abnormal heartbeats and artifacts must be removed from consideration. The following time‐domain parameters can be calculated for short‐term recordings:
• Mean HR, • Mean NN • SDNN • RMS‐SD
Some extra parameters can be calculated specifically for long‐term recordings. The time‐domain parameters are associated mostly with overall variability of HR over the time of recording, except RMS‐SD, which is associated with fast (parasympathetic) variability.
2.4.2. Frequency‐domain HRV
A standard spectral analysis routine is applied to such modified recording and the following parameters evaluated on 5‐min time interval:
• Total Power (TP) • High Frequency (HF)
Scientific Background ‐ 14 ‐

Biocom HRV Live! User’s Manual
• Low Frequency (LF) • Very Low Frequency (VLF) • LF/HF Ratio • Normalized High Frequency (HFnorm) • Normalized Low Frequency (LFnorm) When long‐term data is evaluated an additional frequency band is derived – Ultra Low Frequency. The HF power spectrum is evaluated in the range from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz. This band reflects parasympathetic (vagal) tone and fluctuations caused by spontaneous respiration known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The LF power spectrum is evaluated in the range from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz. This band can reflect both sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. The VLF power spectrum is evaluated in the range from 0.0033 to 0.04 Hz. The physiological meaning of this band is most disputable. With longer recordings, it is considered to represent sympathetic tone as well as slower humoral and thermoregulatory effects. There are some findings that in shorter recordings VLF has fair representation of various negative emotions, worries, rumination etc. The TP is a net effect of all possible physiological mechanisms contributing in HR variability that can be detected in 5‐min recordings, however sympathetic tone is considered as a primary contributor. The LF/HF Ratio is used to indicate balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. A decrease in this score might indicate either increase in parasympathetic or decrease in sympathetic tone. It must be considered together with absolute values of both LF and HF to determine what factor contributes in autonomic disbalance.

4. Running New HRV Live! Session
The HRV Live! measures heart rate data deriving it from either pulse wave or ECG signal.
4.1. Proper Pulse Wave Sensor Placement And Use
With the HRV Live! you can record heart rate data using Biocom HRM‐02 pulse wave sensor with an ear‐clip probe. The device has a small plastic box with a long USB cable and round stereo‐type jack connector. A separate ear‐clip sensor probe is connected to the device box. Connect the device USB cable to any USB port in the computer. The software will detect it automatically. Place an ear‐clip on the left or right ear lobe. Make sure it is placed so that small glass windows on the inside surfaces of the clip are in good contact with soft tissue of the ear lobe. Be aware that proper placement will affect the quality of pulse wave signal. Small ear lobes or earrings may make placement more difficult.
In some cases when earlobe placement does not give good pulse wave signal the ear‐ clip can be placed on a finger.

The view is divided in two parts: Heart Rate data (top) and the ECG trace (bottom). It is very important to have heart rate recordings free of any abnormal readings to perform correct heart rate variability analysis! Unfortunately there might be various reasons for having unstable heart rate calculation like:
• Improper sensor placement that produces weak or unstable signal; • Body movements producing movement artifacts on raw signal; • Ectopic heartbeats that cannot be involved into HRV evaluation. Using this view you may review the HR data and tag abnormal HR readings. The program displays a recorded ECG or pulse wave trace as a line graph and HR readings as big blue dots along the signal trace. Thus you can see whether HR reading was calculated properly. The normal heartbeat should be detected in the near proximity to the R‐peak (very sharp and narrow peak) on ECG trace or at the front (ascending) part of pulse wave and its value should not deviate from previous normal HR reading more than 30%. The software is capable of an automatic search of various types of abnormal heartbeats irrelevant to their cause. It is based on standard statistical procedure of exclusion of rough artifacts from data series. This procedure involves the following steps: 1. Linear trend is removed from HR data record. 2. Mean HR and standard deviation of HR (SD) are calculated).

3. Each HR reading is tested as belonging to the normal HR data pool based on Student t‐test.
However this method only works if the number of artifacts found is a small part of entire data series, otherwise the results are not reliable and such HR data should not be evaluated for HRV at all. Once abnormal HR reading are automatically detected and toggled into an "abnormal" state marked with big red dot. If you see an abnormal peak marked with a blue dot, you can manually toggle it in “red” by double‐clicking the dot. If you see a normal R‐peak marked with a red dot, you can manually toggle it in “blue” by double‐clicking the dot. Any dot can be manually toggled to either state at any time.
