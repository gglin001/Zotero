abstract
This study is intended for describing the application of the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and the time domain features acquired from its ﬁrst and second derivatives for biometric identiﬁcation. For this purpose, a sum of 40 features has been extracted and a feature-ranking algorithm is proposed. This proposed algorithm calculates the contribution of each feature to biometric recognition and collocates the features, the contribution of which is from great to small. While identifying the contribution of the features, the Euclidean distance and absolute distance formulas are used. The efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by the results of the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) classiﬁer applications of the features. During application, each 15-period-PPG signal belonging to two different durations from each of the thirty healthy subjects were used with a PPG data acquisition card. The ﬁrst PPG signals recorded from the subjects were evaluated as the 1st conﬁguration; the PPG signals recorded later at a different time as the 2nd conﬁguration and the combination of both were evaluated as the 3rd conﬁguration. When the results were evaluated for the k-NN classiﬁer model created along with the proposed algorithm, an identiﬁcation of 90.44% for the 1st conﬁguration, 94.44% for the 2nd conﬁguration, and 87.22% for the 3rd conﬁguration has successfully been attained. The obtained results showed that both the proposed algorithm and the biometric identiﬁcation model based on this developed PPG signal are very promising for contactless recognizing the people with the proposed method.

1. Introduction
The fact that today security comes into prominence more and more each day brings the need for one to keep in his/her mind much further and complicated codes and carry extra cards with him/her and that this situation is getting far from practicality and reliability boosts the need for biometric identiﬁcation. Today most of the systems like ﬁnancial transactions, computer networks and access into secure places still recognize the authorized people via the identiﬁcation card and password. Such systems are not secure enough because of the fact that information can easily be stolen and forgotten. Biometric systems are able to provide more reliability and privacy since they work with the principle of identifying the physical and behavioral characteristics of a person which are possessed only by that person himself/herself and which distinguish him/her from others [1].
Certain distinctive features of our body or behavioral attributes, such as ﬁnger print, face [2,3], voice [4], retina/iris [5], lip movements [6], walking style [7], electroencephalography (EEG) [8] and

electrocardiography (ECG) [9,10] are viewed as means of human identiﬁcation. These applications based on biometric approaches will provide us with a promising and irrefutable future of human recognition. However, a ﬁnger print can be characterized with latex, face recognition can be faked with a photograph, voice can be imitated [11], and the EEG and ECG-based methods are impractical as various electrodes are required in order to acquire bio-signals.
PPG is a non-invasive electro-optical method which gives information about the volume of blood ﬂowing through a testing zone of the body, close to the skin. In order to acquire PPG signal, a source of light, the wavelength of which is λ, is placed on one side of a jut of the body (e.g. a ﬁnger) and on the other side, a photo-detector is placed right across the source to see the transmitted light. A typical PPG signal consists of a large DC component passing through the skin, muscle and bone without passing through the blood vessels, a small AC component passing directly through the blood vessels by detaching itself from the skin, muscle and bone and also a light passing through the arterial blood vessels. Shortly after the systole, the amount of blood in the arteries increase, thus the intensity of light received decreases. During the diastole, the amount of blood in the arteries decrease and an increase in the light transmittance is observed. On a basic

measurement zone, 99% of the signal comes from the skin, muscle and bone while 0.9% from the veins and 0.1% from the arteries [12]. In Fig. 1, the schematic diagram of the DCM03 reﬂective sensor used for acquiring the PPG signal and a PPG signal-acquisition card are seen [13].
The recommended method in this study comprises the new feature extractions with PPG signals aiming at biometric recognition, data acquisition, pre-processing, PPG signaling and the feature extraction of PPG signal using its ﬁrst and second derivatives, the recommendation of a feature ranking algorithm by analyzing the contribution of the extracted features to biometric recognition and the k-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation processes. The process of data acquisition was provided by 30 volunteers through a PPG data acquisition card. Various artifacts like analog circuit noises to be found in the signal acquired by pre-processing, medium illuminance change, respiration and base deviation arising from movement are eliminated. 40 features of PPG signal in the time domain, such as systolic peak, diastolic peak, augmentation index, peak-to-peak interval and pulse width were found using the PPG signal and its derivates. For each of these features, feature ranking process was performed by separately calculating their contribution to biometric recognition. The ﬁrst 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 of the ranked features were selected, and the k-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation method was used for each of them separately.
2. Related works
In their studies, Gu et al. offer a new approach of human veriﬁcation using the PPG signals acquired easily from the ﬁngertips. They performed their experimental studies on a group of 17 healthy subjects. They obtained four feature parameters from digitized PPG signals. A feature vector template was formulated using the recorded signals, and later on, the discriminant function was applied in order to verify the data. This promising method of human identiﬁcation ﬁnally achieved a 90% success [1]. In another study, two important inferences like the derivatives of PPG signals, and the consistency of subjects within themselves and the distinguishability among different subject are examined. Experimental results suggest that using statistical instruments, the derivatives can certainly indicate the features of one's PPG signal and can be used as biometrics for recognition [14].
In another study, on the other hand, the feasibility of the application of PPG signal as a single biometrical feature along with the signal-processing methods for the matter involved are being researched. The PPG signals were acquired from the ﬁngertips of 29 healthy subjects. The experimental results suggest that when PPG signals come under a controlled environment with infallible sensors, biometrics for identiﬁcation can also be used [15].
Wei et al., in their studies, addressed that PPG signals could reﬂect numerous physiological parameters, such as heart functions, blood vascular elasticity and blood viscosity. This is a new

non-invasive method with the advantages like smoothness and accuracy. It is important to ﬁnd out efﬁcient pre-processing and feature extraction algorithms in order to deal with the original PPG signal that could be affected by many other factors. Most of the practical methods include median and FIR (ﬁnite inﬁnite response) ﬁltration. In this study, a new algorithm is recommended in order to eliminate the wavelet transform-based baseline deviation. The inference of feature spots is another important issue. A sophisticated differential algorithm is used to solve this problem. All these practical algorithms have created an effective platform for determining the physiological parameters.[16]
Gu et al., in another study of theirs, have showed a fuzzy-logic approach to examine the feasibility of the application of PPG signals as a new method in the identiﬁcation of humans.
The PPG signals were acquired from the ﬁngertips of 17 healthy subjects and were used as fuzzy entries for the classiﬁcation of four distinctive features. The rate of success in the fuzzy-based decision can reach up to 94% in the same testing and 84% for two different trials. This outcome suggests that this new PPG-based biometry is potentially feasible in the veriﬁcation of humans [17].
In another study, the design of an ampliﬁer circuit intended for extracting the DC component of the signal is being negotiated for PPG signals. Consequently, a high AC signal with SNR (signal-tonoise ratio) is acquired from a raw PPG signal, adding a biasadjusted circuit to the ampliﬁer. This hardware development resulted in acquiring a better signal quality and a data handling convenience in recognition (identiﬁcation) [18].
In another study, it was emphasized that the ﬁnger print of someone could be imitated by placing a thin ﬁlm or using the artiﬁcial copy of that print in a biometric system operating via ﬁnger scanning. This study researches into the possibility to utilize the PPG signal as an additional parameter along with the ﬁnger print. The uniqueness of a ﬁnger impact proﬁle was approved in the preliminary studies [19].
Venkatasubramanian et al., in their studies, stated that body area networks (BAN) could play an important role in tracking the health conditions of soldiers in the battle ﬁeld. A secure BAN is required to maintain the security of soldiers. This research offers a key agreement protocol referred to as PPG-based PKA. This study shows the feasibility of PPG signals to communicate over a common symmetrical encoding key between two spots within BAN [20].
Humphreys et al., in their studies, developed and tested an image-based PPG system against the ﬁngertip-based one often used in the conventional clinical practices. Since a direct contact with the tissue is required in conventional applications, performing such practices on a lesion makes them impossible to apply. So as to cope with this inadequacy, a CMOS camera –based system selecting the PPG signal without contacting the tissue was developed. The comparison of the conventional methods and the conclusions yielded perfect results [21].
In another study, a contact-free reﬂection PPG (NRPPG) is being developed for the purpose of monitoring the PPG signal features

and comparing it with a contact PPG (CPPG). The CPPG and NRPPG signals acquired simultaneously from 22 healthy subjects are studied. The power spectrums of these PPG signals are compared among themselves and analyzed. The results suggest that NRPPG can be used in the evaluation of cardio-physiological signals [22].
In yet another study, a CMOS camera-based imaging PPG system (PPGI) is identiﬁed to perceive the blood vibrations in the tissue. PPGI draws the attention to the potential applications in the visualized blood ﬂow. The change in the density of three wavelengths (600 nm, 520 nm and 432 nm) is perceived within each pixel of the image and analyzed. Special image processing software was developed in order to obtain a two-dimensional map of the blood ﬂow measurements of the skin. High deﬁnition PPGI images are derived from human ﬁngers (by transmission mode) and from face (by reﬂection mode) through evaluating them with these three wavelengths. This newly-developed system could be useful in tracking the skin blood ﬂow for clinical applications [23].
In another study, it is cited that the optical sensors in which photons are used as the detectors are becoming increasingly signiﬁcant in a non-invasive identiﬁcation area. When compared with EEG, MRI and FMRI, they are relatively cheap, easy-to-use and easy -to-install. Among many optical sensors, PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors have the ability to measure the blood volume changes of subcutaneous veins. The objective is the identifying parameters like the heart rate and the respiratory rate. The heart rate can be measured by the real-time PPG signals obtained from the sensors. The detailed analyses of the frequency spectrum of PPG signal suggest a cardiac peak at about 1 Hz for 60 heartbeats a minute and a respiratory peak at about 0.25 Hz for 15 inhalation a minute [24].
Ram et al., in their studies, have emphasized that the performances of pulse oximetres are highly inﬂuenced by the motion artifacts (MA) getting involved in the PPG signal. As a simple and efﬁcient approach, they propose an adaptive step-size least mean squares (AS-LMS) adaptive ﬁlter for reducing MA s in corrupted PPG signals [25].
In another study, on the other hand, while getting the PPG signal, the most appropriate position for the sensor can be found out by researching a low DC deviation in the signal. The AC component is great in a position where the DC ﬂuctuation is small in the recommended PPG. Of the four blood vessels, dorsal,

palmer, ulnar and radial vessel areas, small DC amplitude and large AC amplitude were observed in the ulnar vessel area [26].
3. Materials and methods
3.1. PPG biometrics dataset
In this study, PPG signals were acquired from a total of thirty healthy volunteers, seventeen of whom are male and thirteen of whom are female as shown in Table 1. The data were obtained from their right index ﬁngers while they were seated in a calm position.
Prior to the acquisition of data, information regarding the study was given to the volunteers, the questions they were curious about were answered, the explanations as to the privacy of the data and their personal information and keeping them within the limits of scientiﬁc studies were made, and they were given a form to ﬁll out the information about their consent and approval of volunteering to participate in this study. A 15-period-signal (each) was acquired from each individual at two different time spans. 40 characteristic features were extracted for each period. The Z-score method was used in standardizing these characteristic feature variables. The 1st conﬁguration data set with the characteristic features acquired by the ﬁrst received signals from the subjects, the 2nd conﬁguration data set with the characteristic features received at a different time later on and a 3rd conﬁguration data set by combining these two data sets were built up. In order to enable the permanency of the characteristic features acquired from the volunteers to be evaluated with more than one example within a given time in due course, datasets of the 1st conﬁguration and the 2nd conﬁguration were created. A dataset of the 3rd conﬁguration was created to be able to identify the characteristic features which had duration in time. In Fig. 2, the acquisition of PPG signal from a volunteer is demonstrated.
3.2. The proposed PPG biometrics recognition system
In this study, the system, the block diagram of which is shown in Fig. 3 is recommended. In this system were the PPG signals acquired by a PPG data acquisiton card with a STM32F103xC ARM

based 32 bit microcontroller and a 2 kHz sampling frequency, and on which there is a DCM03 reﬂective sensor. In order to debug the noises in the PPG signal as a pre-processing, a FIR low-pass ﬁlter with N¼ 200 points 10 Hz cut-off frequency was utilized. The ﬁrst and the second derivatives are calculated via the ﬁltered PPG signal.
40 time domain features are acquired by normalizing the ﬁltered PPG and its derivatives to the range of 0–1. These characteristic features are used for the purpose of classiﬁcation after the feature ranking and feature selection processes, respectively.

3.2.1. Differentiation stage The formula for differentiation has to provide three character-
istics for one-dimensional digital signals:

1. Both the ﬁrst and the second derivatives should be zero where the function is constant.
2. The ﬁrst derivative should be constant and the second derivative should be zero for the decreasing and increasing beams.
3. At the beginning of the decreasing and increasing curves, the ﬁrst derivative should be different from zero, and the second derivative, on the other hand, should be different from zero both at the beginning and the end of them.

These are the three characteristics of the common math differentiation.
Considering these characteristics, the derivative for onedimensional signals can be calculated as follows:

3.2.2. Feature extraction stage: time domain features At this stage, characteristic features are extracted from PPG
signal and its ﬁrst and second derivatives. In Figs. 5 and 6, the relation between PPG signal and its ﬁrst and second derivative is shown, respectively. Feature points in PPG signals are determined using these correlations.
In Figs. 7 and 8 are all the feature spots shown. The ﬁrst detected feature spots are the systolic peak points. Then for the ﬁrst derivative previous to the position of these systolic peak points in PPG signal, there is the ﬁrst peak point which is a1; for the second derivative, there is the ﬁrst peak and there are a2 and b2 points which are the ﬁrst pit points. Then comes b1, e1, f1 points for the ﬁrst derivative and e2 and f2 for the second derivative following the position of systolic peak point. By these

used as a matrix input which consists of n period, which has, for each period, an m À 1 different feature and classiﬁcation label and which has n line m column. Our objective is to determine the features that will classify each period accurately using the distance functions and to rank the features according to the percentage of accurate classiﬁcation. To that end, this feature ranking algorithm is proposed.

3.2.3. Feature ranked stage: distance based supervised feature ranked algorithm
A feature ranking algorithm is proposed for the 40 features calculated during this study. The proposed ranking algorithm is

to redundant and irrelevant features. At the stage of feature ranking, such redundant and irrelevant features rank last in AOFR.
In this stage of study, the ﬁrst 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 features from the ranked ones are selected and several classiﬁcation accomplishments are made for k ¼1, 3, 5, 7, 10 values by means of k-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation method. The number of features yielding the best classiﬁcation achievement and k value are selected as the classiﬁer model.
In this case, a decision as to how many of the ranked features must be selected ﬁrst should be made. In particular, the reason for the ﬁrst ranked ones to be 5, 10, …, 40 during the selection is to allow for a less amount of time for the processing time. Here, if required, the selection can be made in the form of 1, 2, 3, …, 40, however, the processing time will multiply ﬁvefold. Of these ranked features selected, the step value in the form of the ﬁrst 5 features can be put to the user request. This process has been suggested as a method of research for the best classiﬁcation performance.
3.2.5. Classiﬁcation stage: distance based classiﬁer algorithms This is the process of determining what individuals the input
signals of the utilized methods belong to in cases where the

characteristic feature points obtained from the classiﬁcation input signals are qualitative. The purpose, here, is to identify the class label of the input signal in a space of a given number classes. The concept of similarity is usually deﬁned by the reversal of distance. In the distance-based classiﬁcation, minimum distance is used for high similarity. The most popular method performing classiﬁcation by utilizing the distances between the characteristic feature points is the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
k-Nearest neighbors algorithm
 k value is arbitrarily determined.  The distances between the characteristic feature points with
unknown class labels and those with the known class labels are calculated. In general, the Euclidean distance is utilized.
 The calculated distances are ranked. The closest k number of
class labels with the smallest distance are ascertained.
 Among the k number of class labels ascertained, the one with
the majority is determined. This determined class label is assigned as the outcome of the unknown class.
In order for the classiﬁcation success to be assessed objectively, methods referred to as cross validation should be applied. In these methods, the data contained within the system are divided in two

as the training dataset and the testing dataset. The training data are used to train the system, whereas the testing data are utilized to evaluate the success of the trained system. In the literature, three types of cross validation methods are proposed:
 Repeated random sub-sampling validation;  K-fold cross-validation;  Leave-one-out cross-validation.

In the repeated random sub-sampling validation, the training and testing data are randomly selected from the dataset. This is the method ensuring the highest level of success within the cross validation.
In the K-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k pieces of folds. One fold is used for the testing data, and the remaining K À 1 folds are combined and employed as training data. This process is repeated K times through the transposition of the

sets. For the success status, the average of K number of success values is taken.
Leave-one-out cross-validation method is quite similar to the K-fold cross-validation. The leave-one-out cross-validation method for the dataset consisting of N number of samples is the application of the K-fold method as in: K ¼N.
During this stage, the k-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation algorithm was used. Through leave-one-out method, the classiﬁcation success was achieved. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm categorizes by means of using the distances between data points. In order to identify the class of any PPG period, separate distances are calculated between the feature spots extracted from

that period and those extracted from all the PPG periods, the classes of which are known. As for distance, the Euclidean distance was used in this study. The selected number of k labels with the majority of the class label of the most closely known period was determined as the class of an unknown period.
4. Results and discussion
In this study, a classiﬁcation model was built up for biometric identiﬁcation, with the PPG signals acquired from 30 volunteers. 40 features were extracted using PPG signals and its derivatives.

Fig. 11. The selected feature numbers for the 3rd conﬁguration and the percentages of classiﬁcation success depending on the changes in classiﬁcation algorithm k values.

A feature ranking algorithm was proposed in order to rank these features. In the proposed feature ranking algorithm, k¼ 3, 5, 7 and 10 values were applied for majority voting. The selection process, in particular, was done by picking out the ﬁrst ranked 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 features separately and by deciding as to how many features had to be selected considering the one with the highest achievement of classiﬁcation. The classiﬁcation process was done by utilizing the k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer algorithm and leave-one-out transposition for k¼ 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 values.
In Table 2, the ranked features are shown according to k values used in the feature ranking algorithm for the 1st conﬁguration. The percentages of classiﬁcation success are shown in Table 3. The percentages of classiﬁcation success are calculated using the ranked features for k ¼5 value in Table 2. The best classiﬁcation success was achieved as 90.44% for k ¼1 value of the classiﬁcation algorithm where the ﬁrst 25 features were used. Besides, it is seen that when there is no feature selection and ranking process in Table 3, a 89.33% of classiﬁcation success at most could be achieved for the classiﬁcation algorithm k¼ 1 value in the event that all the features are used. In this case, a 1.11% of increase in the classiﬁcation success was attained through the feature ranking and selection process for the 1st conﬁguration. The percentages of classiﬁcation success for the 1st conﬁguration are graphically shown in Fig. 9. The performance measurement values calculated from this matrix, such as precision, recall, speciﬁcity and f-measure, are shown in Table 4.
Similarly, in Table 5, the ranked features according to the k values used in the feature ranking algorithm are shown for the 2nd conﬁguration. In Table 6 are the percentages of classiﬁcation success shown. They are calculated using the ranked features for k ¼5 value in Table 5. The best classiﬁcation success was achieved as 94.44% for k¼ 1 value of the classiﬁcation algorithm where the ﬁrst 20 features were used. Besides, it is seen that when there is no feature selection and ranking process in Table 6, a 90.22% of classiﬁcation success at most could be achieved for the classiﬁcation algorithm k ¼1 value in the event that all the features are used. In this case, a 4.22% of increase in the classiﬁcation success was attained through the feature ranking and selection process for the 2nd conﬁguration. The percentages of classiﬁcation success for the 2nd conﬁguration are graphically shown in Fig. 10. The performance measurement values calculated from this matrix,

such as precision, recall, speciﬁcity and f-measure are shown in Table 7.
Similarly, in Table 8, the ranked features according to the k values used in the feature ranking algorithm are shown for the 3rd conﬁguration. In Table 9 are the percentages of classiﬁcation success shown. They are calculated using the ranked features for k ¼ 5 value in Table 8. The best classiﬁcation success was achieved as 87.22% for k ¼3 value of the classiﬁcation algorithm where the ﬁrst 15 features were used. Besides, it is seen that when there is no feature selection and ranking process in Table 9, a 84.22% of classiﬁcation success at most could be achieved for the classiﬁcation algorithm k ¼1 value in the event that all the features are used. In this case, a 3% of increase in the classiﬁcation success was attained through the feature ranking and selection process for the 3rd conﬁguration. The percentages of classiﬁcation success for the 3rd conﬁguration are graphically shown in Fig. 11. The performance measurement values calculated from this matrix, such as precision, recall, speciﬁcity and f-measure are shown in Table 10.
When Tables 2 and 6 are compared, the ranking of 40 features acquired for the 1st conﬁguration and the 2nd conﬁguration is not the same, which suggests that the features could rank differently in achieving the best performance depending on time. Since the 3rd conﬁguration is formed by the combination of the 1st conﬁguration and the 2nd conﬁguration, the features ranked in Table 10 are more accurate than those in Tables 2 and 6 in the evaluation of the features with duration in time.
The diagrams in Figs. 12 and 13 are given in order to demonstrate, for biometric recognition, the availability of the major features extracted as time-domain from the PPG signal. In Fig. 12, according to the ﬁrst three major features selected through DBSFRA for the 1st conﬁguration, the 2nd conﬁguration and the 3rd conﬁguration, the distributions of classiﬁcation of 6 individuals are shown. In Fig. 13, on the other hand, The PPG signal periods of an individual and the alteration of the major features selected through DBSFRA among these periods are separately depicted for the 1st conﬁguration, the 2nd conﬁguration and the 3rd conﬁguration.
The physical descriptions of some features between the obtained ranked 15 features for the best performance in the 3rd conﬁguration are given in Table 11.

5. Conclusions and future works
In this study, 40 characteristic features were acquired using the PPG signal and its ﬁrst and second derivatives. A system intended

for the application of these features was performed for biometric identity authentication. The duration of the 40 features received from the volunteers within this proposed system was evaluated through two samples different from each other in time.

b2/a2

Takazawa et al. [30] demonstrated that the b/a ratio reﬂects increased arterial stiffness, hence the b/a ratio increases with age. Imanaga et al. [31] provided a direct evidence that magnitude of b/a of the APG is related to the distensibility of the peripheral artery, and suggest that the magnitude of b/a is a useful non-invasive index of atherosclerosis and altered arterial distensibility Aiba et al. [32] suggested the parameter -b/a in the exposure group dose dependently decreased with increases in length of working career (duration of exposure to lead) and blood lead concentration (Pb–B). The parameter À b/a signiﬁcantly decreased in subjects with working careers of 5 years or more and in subjects whose Pb–B was 40 g/100 ml or more. While Nousou et al. [33] found that the b/a index discriminates independently between subjects with essential hypertension and healthy controls Otsuka et al. [34] found that the b/a, is positively correlated to the Framingham risk score. Framingham risk score has been used to estimate individual risk of cardiovascular heart disease. Their results suggest that b/a index might contribute to the discrimination of the high-risk subjects for cardiovascular heart disease Baek et al. [35] conﬁrmed that the b/a ratio increases with age

Peak to peak tpp The R–R interval in the ECG signal correlates closely with the peak–peak interval APG signal as both represent a completed heart

cycle. The peak–peak interval has been used to detect the heart in PPG signals [36,37]

IPA ¼A2/A1

Wang et al. [38] have divided the pulse area into two areas at the dicrotic notch. They found that the ratio of the two areas, can be

used as an indicator of total peripheral resistance. This ratio is called the inﬂection point area ratio (IPA)

27

e2/a2

Takazawa et al. [30] demonstrated that an increase of the e/a ratio reﬂects decreased arterial stiffness, and that the e/a ratio decreases with age. Baek et al. [35] conﬁrmed that the e/a ratios decreases with age

At this stage, our experimental studies have been conﬁned to these mentioned so far as this has been the ﬁrst study of ours we have been working on. The feature points to be acquired in consequence of the evaluations to be performed through further examples different from each other in time would be a more accurate approach in achieving the best result for identity authentication. It was observed that the feature ranking and selection algorithm we proposed boosted the classiﬁcation success of the system. Moreover, the rates of success provided here are found by means of separately assessing each period acquired from the volunteers. In fact, it is seen that while performing identity authentication, success will be boosted further when authentication is performed by taking into consideration the majority voting of more than one period to be received from an individual. The results obtained suggest that the use of the PPG signal for biometric authentication is very promising. In our prospective studies, we will be increasing the success for the matter involved by also carrying out frequency-based analyses as well as the features acquired from PPG signals at time domain.
