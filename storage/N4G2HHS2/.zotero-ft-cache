How to Analyze Stress from Heart Rate & Heart Rate Variability: A Review of Physiology

STRESS AFFECTS THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

TERMINOLOGY
• Heart rate (HR): heartbeat frequency as beats per minute (bpm)
• Heartbeat (R‐R interval): time between consecutive heartbeats (R‐waves) in milliseconds (ms)
• Heart rate variability (HRV): beat‐to‐beat variation in the time between consecutive R‐R intervals

HEART RATE VARIABILITY: A WINDOW TO THE BODY

Recovery Vagal nervous activity Regulation of respiration Sympathetic reactions
Autonomic nervous system
Oxygen uptake

• Lifestyle assessment is based on analysis or heart rate variability (HRV)
• HRV means the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats
• Heart rate variability is regulated by the autonomic nervous system and affected e.g. by age, physical condition and stress.
• Firstbeat utilizes HRV to make a model of the body’s physiological states.
• HRV is used to estimate: • respiration frequency
• oxygen uptake • energy expenditure • training effect (EPOC) • recovery and stress

INFLUENCE OF RESPIRATION ON HEART RATE

The figure shows how the cyclic variation of respiration (RSA, respiratory sinus arrhytmia) affects heart rate variability.

Exhalation: Inhalations:

HR drops HR increases

RRI lengthens RRI shortens

HRV grows HRV gets smaller

WHEN HR DROPS, HRV GETS BIGGER

• In a healthy, fit adult, HRV usually grows during rest.

• Sleeptime recovery (its quality) is weakened by various stressors, such as stress,

sleep problems, illnesses, medications, alcohol, weak physical condition and

overweight.

Heart rate drops during sleep

Heart rate variability (RMSSD)

HRV grows during sleep

FACTORS AFFECTING HEART RATE VARIABILITY

HEART RATE ALONE DOES NOT REVEAL OVERLOAD
Before the overload: • Avg. HR 48 • Avg. HRV 82 ms • HRV is big  indicates good
recovery and health
2 months later: • Avg. HR 47 bpm • Avg. HRV 12 ms • HRV dramatically reduced:
obvious signs of overload / no signs of recovery

STRESS AND RECOVERY IN FIRSTBEAT REPORTS
 The result reflects changes that take place in the autonomic nervous system.
 When the activation level is elevated, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system increases  a stress reaction.
 Time periods when the parasympathetic nervous system is dominant are identified as recovery.
 There is no right or wrong way to react to a situation! It’s more essential to determine if the reaction is meaningful (e.g. whether recovery state is seen during a relaxation activity or sleep).

DEFINITION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES

Stress reactions

Recovery

Increased activation level in the body caused by stress reactions. The reaction can be positive or negative. Sympathetic dominance.
High heart rate, increased respiration frequency, low heart rate variability, oxygen uptake <20% of maximal capacity (VO2max).

Lowered activation level & calming down of the body. Nighttime sleep and relaxing breaks are important recovery periods. Parasympathetic dominance.
Low heart rate, low respiration frequency, high heart rate variability, oxygen uptake <20% VO2max.

Physical activity

Other state

Physical stress / activity during which the intensity is > 30% of maximal capacity.
Daily physical activity
Low‐level physical stress/activity during which the intensity is 20‐30% of maximal performance.

Other state (white) is typically recovery from exercise, short awakenings during sleep or missing data periods (for example during a shower).

CAUSES OF STRESS / STRESS REACTIONS

Physical stressors (internal) • Fatigue • Overload / overtraining • Burnout • Pain • Acute infections • Chronic illnessess • Dehydration • Digestion • Pregnancy
Physical stressors (external) • Heavy exercise training • Lack of sleep • Physical workload • Stimulants e.g. coffee • Medications • Alcohol or other substances,
hangover • Sauna • Temperature, noise, altitude • Jetlag

Psychological stressors • Anxiety, depression, sorrow • Negative emotions • Traumatic events • Work stress • Psychological conditions • Fear, tension • Relationship problems • Excitement e.g. falling in love
Social stressors • Pressures • Lack of social support • Presentation / speech • Fear of social situations
