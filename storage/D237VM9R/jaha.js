Smartphone camera-based photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse waveform measurement discriminates between different heart rhythms, but its ability to diagnose AF in real-world situations has not been adequately investigated. We sought to assess the diagnostic performance of a standalone smartphone PPG application, Cardiio Rhythm, for AF screening in primary care setting.\nPatients with hypertension, with diabetes mellitus, and/or aged ≥65 years were recruited. A single-lead ECG was recorded by using the AliveCor heart monitor with tracings reviewed subsequently by 2 cardiologists to provide the reference standard. PPG measurements were performed by using the Cardiio Rhythm smartphone application. AF was diagnosed in 28 (2.76%) of 1013 participants. The diagnostic sensitivity of the Cardiio Rhythm for AF detection was 92.9% (95% CI] 77-99%) and was higher than that of the AliveCor automated algorithm (71.4% [95% CI 51-87%]). The specificities of Cardiio Rhythm and the AliveCor automated algorithm were comparable (97.7% [95% CI: 97-99%] versus 99.4% [95% CI 99-100%]). The positive predictive value of the Cardiio Rhythm was lower than that of the AliveCor automated algorithm (53.1% [95% CI 38-67%] versus 76.9% [95% CI 56-91%]); both had a very high negative predictive value (99.8% [95% CI 99-100%] versus 99.2% [95% CI 98-100%]).\nThe Cardiio Rhythm smartphone PPG application provides an accurate and reliable means to detect AF in patients at risk of developing AF and has the potential to enable population-based screening for AF.","context":{"all":{"count":12577171,"mean":7.7713747831846,"rank":66169,"pct":99,"higher_than":12511140},"journal":{"count":2991,"mean":21.617033444816,"rank":72,"pct":97,"higher_than":2919},"similar_age_3m":{"count":262363,"mean":12.211321380382,"rank":3054,"pct":98,"higher_than":259309},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":200,"mean":35.995608040201,"rank":11,"pct":94,"higher_than":189}},"authors":["Pak‐Hei Chan","Chun‐Ka Wong","Yukkee C.
