Henri Poincaré (1854­1912)

Poincaré plot
 Poincaré HRV plot is a graph in which each RR interval is plotted against next RR interval (a type of delay map)
 Synonyms
 Scatter plot; scattergram  Return map; phase delay map  Lorenz plot

Quantitative analysis of Poincaré HRV plots
Variable geometries of Poincaré HRV plots
 Ellipse fitting technique  Histogram technique  Correlation coefficient

Ellipse fitting technique

Line­of­identity SD1
SD2

SD1: dispersion (standard deviation) of points perpendicular to the axis of line­of­identity
SD2: dispersion (standard deviation) of points along the axis of line­of­identity

Summary
 Advantages
 Simple visualization tool  Outlier (ectopic beat or artifact) identifier  Possible insights into short­term and long­term
variability
 Limitations
 Derived statistics not independent of other time domain measures
