Preface
The field of medicine has greatly benefitted from the quantitative precision demanded by the fields of physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. This book demonstrates how a record of beat-to-beat heart rate, which requires precision of the order of milliseconds, can contain enormous amounts of embedded and useful information. It is also relevant that such information can only be unraveled by signal processing methods that utilize modern computational platforms. Assessment of the autonomic nervous system used to involve qualitative clinical tests, but heart rate variability signal analysis provided a quick quantitative evaluation of the balance between sympathetic function and parasympathetic function. An important goal of a physician is to apply his or her knowledge to each patient on a case-by-case basis. In this context, heart rate variability signal analysis provides a personalized yardstick to measure the performance of a relatively inaccessible autonomic nervous system.
Study of the heart rate variability signal was the exclusive domain of a handful of laboratories, until only a few years ago. But as science and technology associated with heart rate variability have become ubiquitous, we find it inspiring to observe that the new discipline of heart rate variability signal processing has been used to investigate dozens, if not hundreds, of clinical pathologies across the globe.
Because the heart rate signal can be easily obtained in a number of settings, varying from a physician’s clinic, human experimental laboratories to animal models, the only factor limiting the development of novel applications has been the imagination of the researcher. Ideas from both linear signal processing and non-linear dynamics led the initial foray of identifying fruitful investigations in this field.
While engineers and mathematical physicists have long been cheerleaders for clinical application of heart rate variability analysis to multiple disciplines, adoption of heart rate variability as a tool by physicians in non-cardiology fields has been slow and is still largely limited to prediction of morbidity and mortality following myocardial infarction and stroke. Scientific skepticism is very much alive in identifying limitations of the technique and interpreting its results. Rigorous studies are still needed to validate several concepts underlying heart rate variability signal analysis and mathematical modeling. Many such questions are examined in this book.
Thus, it is our view that heart rate signal analysis will provide a rich array of challenging issues to be explored for many years to come.

1.1  Introduction
Heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure (BP) variability have emerged as multidisciplinary areas of research mainly due to continuous interactions between engineers, physicians and physiologists. Physicists and mathematicians have also contributed concepts from their respective fields. This chapter provides a brief historical perspective of HRV and speculates about its future.
Some of the earliest studies on the significance of the beat-to-beat variability of heart rate (HR) were reported by Hon and Lee. They studied fetal HRV during labor and delivery and its relation to fetal health (Hon, 1963, 1965; Hon and Lee, 1963). A seminal article by Hyndman et al. (1971) documented spontaneous 10 s variations in BP and provided a control system model to describe their discovery. Subsequently, Wolf et al. observed that higher RR interval variance was associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (Wolf et al., 1978). Using pharmacological interventions, Akselrod et al. (1981) demonstrated that sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities of the autonomic nervous system make frequency-specific contributions to the HR power spectrum. They also reported that the renin-angiotensin system activity strongly modulated the amplitude of the spectral peak located at 0.04 Hz.
The continuous development of computer technology and signal processing algorithms (Kay and Marple, 1981; Jenkins and Watts, 1968) accelerated the science of understanding rhythms embedded in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and BP with great vigor and frequency (Kitney and Rompelman, 1980, 1987; Baselli et al., 1986). The discovery that the autonomic nervous system was compromised in clinical conditions such as diabetes (Ewing and Clarke, 1982) and could be studied using power spectral analysis of the HRV signal provided the impetus for further progress in the field. Cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction (Lombardi et al., 1987) and sudden cardiac death (Myers et al., 1986) were found to be related to reduced HRV. Through an extensive analysis of several hundred Holter tapes from patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction, it became evident that a frequently used time domain statistic, namely the standard deviation of the mean heart

rate computed from 24 h Holter ECG, could be used as a predictor of mortality (Kleiger et al., 1987).
Much of HRV analysis is based on linear signal analysis theory, which states that under conditions of statistical stationarity, a signal can be broken up into its constituent components, and physiologists can relate these components to sympathetic and vagal influences impinging on the sino-atrial node. Decomposition of HRV by power spectral analysis dominated research on HRV during much of the 1980s (Bigger et al., 1988; Pagani et al., 1986). The usefulness of HRV slowly expanded from cardiac applications to diverse pathological conditions as delineated in well-documented reviews and books (Malik, 2010; Malik and Camm, 1995, 2004; Eckberg, 1997; Kamath et al., 1987; Kamath and Fallen, 1993; Malliani, 2000; Stein et al., 1994; Table 1.1). Areas of applications include functional reinnervation in patients with cardiac transplants (Fallen et al., 1988; Sands et al., 1989), esophageal stimulation (Tougas et al., 1997; Kamath et al., 1998), chronic renal failure (Forsström et al., 1986), critical care medicine (Prietsch et al., 1994), exercise (Arai et al., 1989; Kamath et al., 1991), fibromyalgia (Raj et al., 2000), hypertension (Baselli et al., 1987), asthma (Kazuma et al., 1997), congestive heart failure (Saul et al., 1988), myocardial infarction (Lombardi et al., 1987; Kleiger et al., 1987; Bigger et al., 1988; Bekheit et al., 1990), non-cardiac chest pain (Tougas et al., 2001; Hollerbach et al., 2000) and vagal stimulation (Kamath et al., 1992), many of which are discussed in this book. By contrast, there is less research on BP variability, perhaps because it is easier to identify peaks in the ECG waveform (Pan and Tompkins, 1985; Friesen et al., 1990) than in the BP waveform. However, BP and HR are closely intertwined, and more research needs to be conducted on BP variability if we are to make progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying HRV (Eckberg, 1997).
In this respect, two of the newer HRV analysis methods included in this book are HR turbulence, which was initially published in 1999 (Schmidt et al., 1999), and phase-rectified signal averaging, which appeared for the first time in 2006 (Bauer et al., 2006). These methods have been proven to be of significant clinical use and have also increased our knowledge about the interaction between BP and HR. The chapter on HR turbulence gives an introduction to the procedure and mechanism of the phenomenon, and the interested reader is directed to the many review articles on this newly evolving field (Watanabe, 2003; Watanabe and Schmidt, 2004; Watanabe and Watanabe, 2004; Francis et al., 2005; Lombardi et al., 2008).
Techniques derived from deterministic chaos have also provided an alternative method for studying HRV and mechanisms responsible for deleterious arrhythmias (Sugihara and May, 1990; Goldberger, 1990; Glass and Kaplan, 1993). Measures such as approximate entropy (Pincus, 1991), sample entropy (Lake et al., 2002; Richman and Moorman, 2000), detrending fluctuation analysis (DFA) (Peng et al., 1994, 1995), multiscale entropy (Costa et al., 2002, 2005) and Lempel–Ziv complexity (Ferrario et al., 2004) have helped to quantitatively unravel the mechanisms of chaos embedded in the HRV signal. As an example, DFA-derived parameters perform better than spectral measures

to distinguish sleep stage and apnea severity (Penzel et al., 2003). Numerous applications of all these methods have been described in this volume.

1.2  Structure of the Volume
This book consists of two parts. The first part comprises Section I (Chapters 2–6), which highlight how both HRV and BP variability signals can be analyzed using signal processing methods. The chapters on HR turbulence and phase-rectified signal averaging are included in this part, describing methods and their clinical applications. The second part comprises Sections II–IV (Chapters 7–25), which provide a detailed evaluation of autonomic dysfunction in a variety of pathological conditions using techniques described in Section I of the book. The subjects of these chapters are diverse and are contributed by researchers with many years of experience in their fields and who have made their mark in the literature.

1.3  Thoughts about the Future
Much progress has been reported in the scientific literature toward understanding mechanisms due to research on the HRV, BP variability and baroreceptor sensitivity. Non-linear analyses and newer methods have supplied a fresh set of tools for studying diseases and states already analyzed with the time domain and frequency domain methods of signal processing. Some outstanding issues of this field as a whole include a lack of standardization of methods and data length and poor knowledge of the interpretation of powers in various frequency bands. For example, we in the field acknowledge that it is overly simplistic to interpret the power in the lower-frequency bands as a reflection of a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic components, while power in the high-frequency band reflects the parasympathetic component only. HRV is also still far from being accepted by physicians as a routine part of their clinical practice, even in cardiology. It would be of mutual benefit for us in the field to reach out to physicians, demonstrate the utility of this wonderful tool for the benefit of their patients and gain cooperation in organizing larger studies that validate longstanding hypotheses. We challenge the readers of this book to get excited about the different ways in which HRV can be applied to illuminate the workings of our body, in sickness and in health, and also push the boundaries of this field, where it is needed.

2.1  Introduction
There are numerous methods and approaches available for time-series analysis. This chapter presents selected methods, which are or at least could be useful when analyzing biosignals, especially heart rate variability (HRV). The methods described here differ greatly, and some of them are commonly used characterization methods. One must always select the method to use, case by case.
The analysis methods are often divided into linear and non-linear methods. The term “non-linear methods” is in fact not quite appropriate and is actually even misleading, because those methods themselves are no more non-linear than common spectrum analysis using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The idea behind the naming convention is merely related to the fact that the system producing the time series is non-linear, which in the case of biological systems might well be true. Sometimes these methods are described using the term chaos-theoretical approach. This is true only of some of the methods in which the assumption that the system’s trajectory in a phase space is actually a chaotic small-dimensional attractor. There is very little proof for the existence of this in biological systems. In particular, if we are studying the cardiovascular blood pressure regulatory system and typical time series such as the sequence of RR intervals, we can find in the literature a growing number of results that indicate this system to be stochastic rather than chaotic.
Biosignal time series, in general, are very difficult to analyze, in many ways. Many methods demand that the time series has thousands of data points, which may be impossible or difficult to achieve, depending on the measurement method used. When the time series is long, notable changes in the biological system will occur almost inevitably and the time series will start to drift in the parameter space of the system due to either internal or external influences. Such instability has a negative effect on all analysis methods in which a specific characteristic of the whole time series is to be compressed into a single statistic. Of course, calculations will produce some result, but what is the meaning of the statistic? Other disturbing factors in these signals are notable noise levels, strong discreteness of the signals due to a limited amplitude resolution of the digitization and regular strong periodic signals, for example, breathing modulation on top of the otherwise possibly chaotic or stochastic signal. It should be remembered that most of the methods described in this chapter were originally developed in physics for analyzing very different, and often practically ideal systems.
Despite warnings stated earlier, an analysis of biosignals using such methods may still yield useful information. Even though the calculated statistic might not exactly

describe the characteristic it was originally designed to represent, it could still play an important role when searching for a correlation with other clinically interesting parameters. However, basic assumptions and limitations accompanying each method should be clearly understood when interpreting results and searching different explanatory models.

2.2  ECG Recording and Generation of RR Interval
2.2.1  RR Interval Time Series
HRV analysis is based on the RR interval time series, the sequence of intervals between successive fiducial points of R peaks of QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG). It should be noted that the RR interval time series are actually an event series and not an equally sampled continuous signal. This fact is important, especially when performing frequency domain analysis. It should also be noted that HRV analysis does not measure the rhythms of the sinoatrial node, which is the pacemaker of the heart, since it is not based on P-P intervals. Therefore, HRV reflects fluctuations in the atrioventricular conduction superimposed on the P-P interval. Nevertheless, it has been shown that beat-to-beat changes in RR intervals reflect the variability of the sinoatrial node quite accurately. In theory, it would be better to use P-P intervals for HRV analysis, but in practice, the amplitude of the P wave is small, which makes the accurate determination of P wave peak difficult, especially in the presence of noise. In turn, this would affect the accuracy of P-P interval measurement.
2.2.2  Time and Amplitude Resolution of ECG Recording
The sampling frequency and amplitude resolution of ECG recording are important parameters in HRV analysis. The sampling frequency determines the temporal resolution of R peak recognition of QRS complexes, and, therefore, it determines directly the accuracy of the measurement of RR intervals. Too low a sampling rate produces digitization noise and introduces errors in all HRV measures, whether in time and frequency domains or in non-linear analyses. In most cases, a sampling rate of 200 Hz corresponding to a temporal resolution of 5 ms is high enough, and higher sampling rates do not give any better results. If the overall variability of RR interval is very low, as it can be, for example, with some heart failure patients, HRV analysis requires a higher sampling rate, since changes in the length of RR intervals cannot be captured below that resolution.
The amplitude resolution of the analog–digital conversion of ECG signal is rarely a limiting factor. The commonly used resolution of 12 bits is normally sufficient. However, the effective amplitude resolution is always less than the resolution of the conversion because the full dynamic range of input signal in the converter is rarely utilized in order to avoid signal clipping or saturation in the case of a large ECG signal or a wandering baseline.
2.2.3  Duration of the Recording
The duration of the recording is determined by the method used for HRV analysis, the aim of the study, and stationarity issues. Typically, frequency domain methods are preferred

12

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

for short-term measurements and time domain methods for long-term measurements of HRV. Some non-linear methods are likewise suitable for short-term analyses and others for long-term analyses. It is important to note that although the same mathematical method is used for the analysis of both short-term and long-term ECG recordings, the physiological interpretation can be different, that is, they cannot necessarily be considered as the surrogates for each other just with a different duration. There are also non-linear methods where results depend directly on the number of data points, and thus, it is inappropriate to compare the HRV measures obtained from recordings of different durations, with each other. This is also true of most linear methods.
2.2.4  Stationarity of the Recording
The stationarity of the signal is of great importance. There are many methods available for evaluating the stationarity of a signal, depending on how we define stationarity. Stationarity can mean, for instance, that there is no shifting in the base level of the signal or that the amplitude distribution, spectrum and autocorrelation function of the signal do not change, as a function of time. More generally, we can say that a signal is truly stationary if parameters that define the working point of the system remain constant in time. This evaluation is extremely difficult to undertake in the case of physiological systems, since we have a limited knowledge of the background dynamics and most physiological parameters are unknown.
Stationarity is strongly linked to the duration of the recording. The longer a recording is, the less stationary it is, because inevitably there are changes in the physiological state of the subject. Whatever method is used for the analysis of long recordings, the result is always a complicated and often a non-intuitive average over physiological states. Unless the method is designed for such a situation (e.g., see DFA), this kind of analysis should be avoided. Hence, the best approach is to divide the recording into shorter segments and perform separate analyses on them. This confers several advantages: shorter segments are often more stationary and results more reliable; the temporal change of results is a measure of stationarity (or lack thereof), which can be used to investigate the time evolution of the system; and finally, changes over segments can be utilized when estimating the statistical relevance of the results. The last advantage is most useful because normally we get a single statistical estimate as a result, but have no possibilities to quantify the statistical significance of this number.
2.2.5  Removing Trends
Most non-stationarities of the signal are not evident until they are revealed by a more advanced analysis. The trend in RR interval time series is easily seen, and it is often interpreted as a sign of non-stationarity, which can be removed by subtracting the trend from the data. However, a priori there is no way to separate the “real” signal and its trend; the signal is never a sum of them. In theory, even large trends can be an essential part of the dynamical behavior of a stationary system. But in practice, many HRV analysis methods are useful only if there is no significant trend in the data irrespective of its origin and in these circumstances, the trend should be removed from the data. Normally, only the linear trend is removed, since the removal of non-linear trends may create a significant bias. From the point of view of spectral analysis, the trend removal decreases the contribution of the

lowest frequencies; thus, further analysis is focused on faster oscillations. And finally, it must be remembered that the removal of a trend does not restore the stationarity of data. The only way to overcome the problem of non-stationarity is to minimize all internal and external disturbances during the study.

2.2.6  Ectopic Beats, Arrhythmias and Noise
The ECG signal can contain technical artifacts or QRS complexes originating outside the sinoatrial node, which introduce errors, since HRV analysis is based on assessment of the variability of sinus rhythm. Artifacts can seriously affect HRV analysis and thus cannot be ignored.
Technical artifacts, such as missed beats (due to problems in the R peak detection) or electrical noise (bad contact in the electrode, movement artifacts), can be easily edited by cleaning the data by a proper interpolation based on the preceding and successive QRS intervals. When interpolating the RR interval time series, it is important that the cumulative time is not altered; RR interval is an event series where the time stamp of each beat is the sum of all preceding beats. For example, the respiratory modulation on RR interval encounters a small phase shift if the time line changes after an interpolated segment. Similarly, time synchronization with other signals should be preserved.
The editing of ectopic beats is more problematic. Ectopic beats are usually premature beats and they produce a very short RR interval followed by a compensatory delay and a prolonged RR interval. Such a short–long pair can be edited without affecting the cumulative time of the beats by lengthening the first interval and shortening the second interval, so that they have equal intervals. However, ectopic beats and most arrhythmias result in reduced stroke volume and cardiac output, leading to transient drops in the blood pressure. This activates autonomic reflexes and induces changes in the efferent autonomic activity. Since these true physiological responses can last 10–30 beats, editing of just the two intervals on either side of ectopic beats does not remove all of the changes in HRV produced by them.
The raw recorded ECG signal should always be inspected. QRS complex identification should be carefully verified. If there are any artifacts or ectopic beats present, the best option is to select a signal segment free of them. If an artifact-free recording is not available, editing can be considered. If an excessive editing of ectopic beats is needed, it should be recognized that HRV analysis can then lead to erroneous results. Very few analysis methods are so insensitive to ectopic beats that the ECG needs no editing at all.

2.3  Time Domain Analysis
The most common time domain estimate of HRV is the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN; normal-to-normal deviation of intervals measured between consecutive sinus beats). SDNN can be calculated, for instance, over 5 min segments (called SDANN) or over 24 h. These two estimates should not be compared because HRV is not a stationary process, that is, a process in which the mean and the variance are independent of the record

14

length. In long-term recordings, the low-frequency (LF) variations contribute a major proportion of the overall HRV power and also to the SDNN. Since HRV normally decreases at higher levels of the heart rate, SDNN can be normalized against this effect by dividing it by the mean RR interval.
Some commonly used HRV measures are based on the differences between RR intervals, such as the root mean square of successive differences of RR intervals (RMSSD), the number of pairs of adjacent RR intervals differing by more than 50 ms (NN50 count) and the ratio of NN50 count to the count of all RR intervals expressed as a percentage (pNN50). Since all of these measures use RR interval differences, they reflect mainly high-frequency (HF) variations of heart rate and are almost independent of long-term trends. Furthermore, these measures are highly correlated with each other and can thus be considered as surrogates of each other.
All time domain HRV estimates are easily calculated; they do not need time-consuming computation. Also, they do not require stationarity in the same manner as most frequency domain and non-linear analyses do. The main limitation of time domain methods is their lack of discrimination between effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic branches.

2.4  Frequency Domain Analysis
The main idea behind the frequency domain analysis of HRV is the observation that HRV is composed of certain well-defined rhythms, which are related to different regulatory mechanisms of cardiovascular control. Time domain HRV measures are mainly markers of overall HRV, although some of them can contain information about heart rate oscillations in certain frequency bands (e.g., RMSSD mainly quantifies fast changes in RR intervals). In order to get more detailed information on the dynamics and frequency components of HRV, more advanced analysis methods, such as power spectral density (PSD) analysis, have to be applied. PSD analysis decomposes the signal into its frequency components and quantifies their relative (and also absolute) intensity, named power. In other words, it provides estimates of the PSD function of the heart rate, namely, the distribution of frequency components. There are two commonly used methods to compute the PSD function: Fourier transform and autoregressive (AR) modeling.
2.4.1  Fourier Transform
The Fourier transform can be used to convert the time domain data into the frequency domain data and back. The Fourier transform is a one-to-one transform, that is, no information is lost or added; the data just has two different representations (Marple, 1987). The normal Fourier transform is defined for continuous functions over the whole real axis. In the case of RR interval time series, the original Fourier transform must be replaced with the discrete version of the transform. The discrete Fourier transform has some unique features which one should be mindful of when using it.
For the equally sampled time series x(tk), where tk = kΔ is the time moment of the data sample, Δ is the sampling interval (the inverse of the sampling rate; see comments below

When the time series x(tk) consists of real values, as it is in our case, n = 0, …, N/2. The discrete Fourier transform (Equation 2.1) gives us N/2 complex numbers (real and imaginary
parts*), thus there is an equal number of data points in x(tk), and X(fn) since the first and last X(fn) has only the real part. The power spectral density is PSD( fn) = X( fn) 2 corresponding to the squared amplitude of the frequency component fn.
The discrete Fourier transform (Equation 2.1) has several important features. First, the
frequency scale is discrete, since only fn components are possible. The resolution of frequency scale depends inversely on the number of data samples N and the sampling inter-
val Δ. The highest-frequency component (n = N/2), called the Nyquist critical frequency, is fc = 1/(2Δ). If the time series x(tk) is a pure sine wave of a frequency exactly equal to one of the frequencies fn, only X(fn) is non-zero, as we can expect. However, if the frequency f of the oscillation is between two adjacent fns, there are many non-zero spectral components X(fn) around f. This is called leakage from one frequency to another in the power spectral estimate, and it is characteristic only of the discrete Fourier transform. This problem can
be partially overcome by using data windowing.

2.4.1.1  Data Windowing
The discrete Fourier transform (Equation 2.1) can be interpreted as a Fourier transform of the product of the infinitely long time series with a square window function, which turns on at t = 0 and off at t = (N−1)Δ. Because of this rapid switching, its Fourier transform has substantial components at higher frequencies, causing the leakage from one frequency to another. To remedy this situation, we can multiply the time series by a window function that changes more gradually from zero to maximum (in the middle of the time series) and then back to zero. There are numerous window functions (named Welch, Parzen, Hanning and so on), but for the purpose of HRV analysis, there is effectively little or no difference between any of them.†
Smoothing
The statistical reliability of the PSD is very low. In fact, the standard deviation (SD) of the PSD estimate is always 100% of the value, and it is independent of N, that is, we cannot get more precise estimates by increasing the number of data points; we just get more discrete frequencies fn. This means that the amplitude of each spectral component is always unreliable from a statistical point of view. Luckily, in HRV analysis, we are not interested in the amplitude of some specific frequency component but in the spectral power over a certain frequency range. If we want to look at the details of the PSD, the

* Complex number X(fn) can be interpreted as a two-dimensional vector. Each X(fn) carries information on the amplitude of the spectral component (the length of the vector) and the phase of the corresponding oscillation (the angle of the vector).
† The difference of the window functions lies in subtle trade-offs among the various figures of merit that can be used to describe the narrowness of the spectral leakage functions.

16

statistical reliability can be increased by smoothing the data using certain methods, for example, the triangular weighting function, but unfortunately, one pays the price of a lower effective frequency resolution. For a 5 min recording, the smoothing range should not be more than 0.01 Hz.

2.4.1.2  FFT Algorithm
The discrete Fourier transform can be computed directly using Equation 2.1, but such an operation would be very time consuming. The FFT is a very effective algorithm to evaluate the discrete Fourier transform (Marple, 1987; Kay and Marple, 1981). It has one limitation: the number of data point N must be an integer power of 2. Since normally the length of the time series is not a power of 2, the data can be padded with zeros up to the next power of 2. This operation corresponds to the interpolation of the original data. Since the actual N used in the FFT calculation is different from the original one, the fns are also slightly different.

2.4.2  Autoregressive Modeling
The AR model is based on the idea that the future values of a time series depend linearly on the previous values (Akaike, 1969). This kind of approach is totally generic, and it can be used to model large sets of different systems. The AR model is determined from the following equation:

p
∑ xk = ajxk− j + uk , j=1

(2.2)

where xk is the sample of the time series, aj is the model parameter, p is the model order and uk represents the noise, the part of the signal that cannot be explained by the previous values of the signal. The computational task is to find optimal model order p such that
parameters aj of the model describes the system as well as possible. When we have such a model, it is possible to compute the corresponding PSD in the form

PSD( f ) =

a0
p

2,

∑ 1 + ajzj

j=1

z = e−2πif ∆,

(2.3)

where f is the frequency and Δ is the sampling interval, as usual. The PSD (Equation 2.3) is capable of modeling sharp peaks since all free parameters are in the denominator, which can be made arbitrarily small.* The PSD approximation (Equation 2.3) is also called an
all-poles model and maximum entropy method. There are many algorithms to find the best
choices for the parameters aj, but Burg’s method is commonly used. Because the AR spectrum is based on a modeling approach, there are no restrictions for the maximal num-
ber of frequency components, that is, PSD can be evaluated using as high a frequency

* In fact, the denominator can be, at least in theory, even zero at certain frequencies. These zeros (also called the poles of Equation 2.3) correspond to the spectral peaks.

resolution as one desires (f in Equation 2.3 is actually a continuous variable), in contrast to the Fourier spectrum where the frequency resolution is determined by the number of data samples. Furthermore, the AR model makes it possible to resolve the central frequencies (the frequency location of each peak) analytically. In clinical setups, this feature is rarely useful, but in research work, it could be interesting.
2.4.2.1  Model Order
The model parameters can be estimated if the model order p is fixed. It could be imagined that the model would be best when using as high a model order as possible. However, in practice, time-series data always include some noise (the term uk in Equation 2.2), so an excessively high model order leads to the model capturing the noise, producing a spectrum with spurious peaks. Too high a model order can also split peaks. Again, too low a model order will strongly smooth spectral peaks, their positions can be shifted and some peaks can even be missing. Some methods have been developed based on information theory for estimating the optimal model order, such as Akaike information criteria (AIC), final prediction error (FPE) or minimum description length (MDL) (Akaike, 1969; Rissanen, 1983; Partzen, 1974). The analytical assumptions underlying these methods are hardly ever fulfilled when analyzing the RR interval time series. Thus, they provide only limited assistance in determining the model order. Therefore, it is recommended that the AR method be used in conjunction with the Fourier transform method (or some other direct method) to help choose the correct model order and to avoid getting spurious spectral features.
2.4.3  Resampling
The RR interval time series is an event series, as stated previously, and each interval has a time stamp, which is the cumulative sum of all preceding intervals. The data can be interpreted as a hypothetical continuous function that has been sampled unevenly in time at the moments of R peaks. In spectral analysis, either in Fourier transform or in AR modeling, the input data (x(tk) in Equation 2.1 or xk in Equation 2.2) are assumed to be the data sampled evenly in time. Hence, the original RR interval data must be converted to such a form by interpolating each interval and resampling this apparently continuous function.* Interpolation can be linear (each interval is interpolated by a straight line) or based on splines.† The method of interpolation makes no essential difference in HRV analysis.
The resampling frequency must clearly be higher than the effective sampling rate of the RR interval data, but it is not critical. The effective sampling rate is equal to the mean heart rate, typically around 1 Hz (= 60 bpm). In practice, a resampling rate of 2–5 Hz is adequate, and there is no need to use a higher rate. In Fourier transform analysis, the highest-frequency component is fc = 1/2Δ, and it increases by a resampling of the data. However, resampling cannot increase the information content of the data, and thus, the highest relevant frequency component is still half of the (effective) sampling rate according to the general sampling theorem (Nyquist criteria); with 60 bpm mean
* The spectrum of event series can be computed correctly without any interpolation and resampling by using the Lomb–Scargle (also called Lomb periodogram) method. This method makes it possible to calculate the spectrum up to frequencies above the Nyquist frequency (= half of the sampling rate or mean heart rate).
† Splines are second-order or higher-order polynomials. If the order is 2, then the spline curve is a parabola with three free parameters, two of them are fixed by demanding that it goes through the data points of the interval and the last one is fixed by demanding that the derivative of the curve is continuous at the data points.

18

heart rate, fc = 0.5 Hz. This is also true in the case of AR modeling, although the PSD estimate can be evaluated up to any frequency. One should notice that when increasing the resampling rate, the order of the AR spectrum must be increased correspondingly.
Sometimes the resampled data are low-pass filtered using a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz (or half of the resampling frequency). Although this operation can, in theory, improve the statistical reliability of the data, it has no real significance in HRV analysis.
2.4.4  Spectral Powers
The total power (TP) of the RR interval data is represented by the area under the PSD curve from zero to the highest relevant frequency fc, and it is equivalent to the variance of the signal. In a typical short-time (≅5 min) spectral analysis, the spectral power is divided into three frequency bands: high frequency (HF; 0.15–0.40 Hz), low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) and very low frequency (VLF; 0–0.04 Hz). In long-term recordings, an ultralow frequency (ULF; 0–0.003 Hz) component can be calculated. The HF component corresponds to heart rate variations related to the respiratory sinus arrhythmia and HF fluctuations are mediated almost exclusively by fluctuations of efferent parasympathetic activity. The central role of sympathetic nervous system on the LF component is well known, but fluctuations in the LF band are also markedly influenced by parasympathetic nervous system. The LF band is important when characterizing baroreflex sensitivity using spectral methods (see Chapter 3). Oscillations at frequencies in the VLF band are often related to the vasomotor tone of thermoregulation or to the dynamics of hormonal systems, but a precise origin of oscillations in this band is still unknown.
The magnitude of HRV in each frequency band is expressed as power. Since the unit of PSD function is either ms2/Hz or s2/Hz depending on the unit of RR interval time series, the unit of HRV power is ms2 or s2. Because the TP and power in each frequency band vary considerably even among healthy subjects of equal age, direct comparisons of power between two subjects can be misleading. For this reason, powers are usually expressed in normalized units, by dividing each power by TP less VLF power. Therefore, normalized powers are not absolute measures either, since they partially reflect the relative powers of LF and HF components.*
The confidence we can have in the accuracy of the power in VLF, LF and HF bands varies, since it is related to the number of full periods of oscillations in each band. If we have a 5 min recording, there are roughly 0–12 periods of the oscillation in the VLF band, 12–45 periods in the LF band and 45–120 periods in the HF band. Although the recommended minimum length of recording for a short-term spectral analysis is 5 min, sometimes it is necessary to use shorter segments due to artifacts, ectopic beats and so on. As a rule of thumb, one can use the criterion that the minimum number of periods be six.† In order to have a reliable power estimate, for instance, in the whole LF band, we need at least 2.5 min worth of usable recording. Similarly for ULF power, the minimum recording length is about 1 h.
A typical example of spectral HRV analysis performed with FFT and AR modeling is presented in Figure 2.1. The length of the RR interval time series was 5 min, and it consisted of 349 intervals. The mean RR interval was 856 ms, corresponding to a heart rate of 70.2 bpm. The spectral analysis was done over the whole time series. Before any analysis,
* If we have two cases with equal absolute LF powers but different HF powers, the normalized LF powers are not equal.
† This is actually an arbitrary number of periods, but in practice, it has proven to be a useful minimum number.

Without windowing or smoothing, the FFT spectrum clearly includes HF components, which disappear after using the Hanning window function. By also applying triangular smoothing (range 0.01 Hz), the spectrum has even less detail, but the statistical reliability of the spectral features has increased. The AR spectrum (right panels) with the model order of 10 cannot capture all essential features. If the model order is increased to 28 (the optimal model order according to AIC, that is, the order at which AIC is at its minimum value, see Figure 2.2), the spectrum resembles the FFT spectrum. If the model order is further increased up to 100, more spectral details can be seen, especially in the lowest frequencies. It is remarkable how similar the spectral details below 0.05 Hz are in both FFT (windowed and smoothed) and AR spectra (model order 100). Although AIC has a minimum value at 28, it increases very slowly with increasing model order. Thus, it is not always obvious which model order should be selected.

2.4.6  Effects of Respiration
The respiratory component of HRV depends strongly on the breathing volume and its frequency. The HF component decreases markedly as breathing volume decreases. In addition, the power of respiratory peak increases as its frequency decreases. If the breathing frequency is below 0.15 Hz, it becomes measured not as the HF component but as a part of the LF component. The effect of the breathing frequency on HRV is presented in Figure 2.3. The breathing volume was fixed in all cases. When the breathing frequency was fixed at 0.10 Hz (the upper right panel in Figure 2.3), the amplitude of the respiratory peak was approximately 0.25, ten times higher than at the breathing frequency of 0.25 Hz (the upper left panel; note the different scale in the y-axis). At a breathing frequency of 0.05 Hz, the peak was still three times higher (the lower left panel).
In practice, the HF component can be used as a measure of parasympathetic tone and vagal activity only in situations in which the breathing frequency and volume are carefully controlled. Controlled respiration at a constant rate, however, can induce some stress, which might affect the function of the autonomic nervous system and therefore interfere with HRV. Using a respiratory frequency that is as close as possible to the natural breathing rate of the subject, one can minimize the stress. This can be accomplished by first measuring the

breathing rate and then adjusting the frequency of metronome accordingly. Another possibility is to use white noise breathing, that is, a metronome guides the subject to breathe at variable rates with constant distribution (see the right bottom panel in Figure 2.3).

2.4.7  Time–Frequency Analysis
When considering perturbation of the autonomic nervous system, usual steady-state spectral analysis methods are no longer useful, since they cannot determine exactly when critical frequency components change in amplitude or frequency. Conversely, if information about temporal variations of frequency components were available, spectral features of slowly changing system could be analyzed in more detail, for instance, to estimate the stationarity of a time series. There are many different approaches to perform a time–frequency analysis, and most of them are based on various integral transforms of the original data. The main limitation on all of them is the trade-off between temporal resolution and statistical reliability of spectral components. It is not possible to determine the amplitude of a certain frequency locally because we always need a time window to measure it. A shorter time window can capture more rapid changes within the power spectra in time, but a longer time window can give a more reliable estimate of the amplitude or spectral power.

2.4.7.1  Windowed Fourier Transform
The most simple and straightforward time–frequency analysis is called the windowed Fourier transform (WFT, also called short-time Fourier transform or STFT). In this approach, the time series is covered by a reasonably short time window that slides over the data in small steps. In each window, the PSD is calculated as described above (e.g., using data windowing, zero padding, trend removing and resampling). As a result, one gets a set of PSDs. In Figure 2.4, we present the results of a WFT performed on the same RR interval data shown in Figure 2.1 as a three-dimensional plot. The width of the window was 60 s

and the step 5 s. The RR interval has prominent low-frequency oscillations around 140 s (see the upper panel in Figure 2.1), and this can be also seen as a large peak in Figure 2.4. Furthermore, the respiratory modulation (the shallow peak in the HF band) seems to be almost constant in time. Although the window step is 5 s, the real-time resolution of the analysis is still approximately 60 s. If there had been an abrupt change in the spectral features of the signal, it would be seen in all the windows covering that moment in time. The same analysis is presented as a contour map in Figure 2.5. This representation reveals that there are a lot of variations in the VLF and LF bands.

Since the number of periods within the window of WFT depends on the frequency, the statistical reliability is different for each frequency component as discussed in Section 2.4.4. If the width of the window is set for the lower frequency components, it becomes unnecessarily wide for higher frequencies. This feature can be avoided if the duration of the window is inversely proportional to the analyzed frequency. This kind of analysis is called selective discrete Fourier transform algorithm (SDA) and can be implemented by normal discrete Fourier transform, but it is computationally intensive (Keselbrener and Akselrod, 1996).

The WVD maps a one-dimensional function of time into a two-dimensional function of time and frequency (Claasen and Mecklenbräuker, 1980a,b; Hyung-Ill and Williams, 1989; Novak and Novak, 1993). For a discrete time series x(n), the distribution (Equation 2.4) can be written in the form

if the kernel function K and W is equal to 1. This distribution is also called a smoothed win-
dowed WVD because of the window functions WM and WN. The function WM is a rectangular window that has a value of 1 for the range of –M/2 < μ < M/2, and WN is a symmetrical window (often also rectangular), which has non-zero values for the range –N/2 < τ < N/2. The parameter N determines the frequency resolution of the WVD, while the parameter M
determines the level of temporal smoothing.
The frequency resolution of the spectrum calculated by the WVD is two times the reso-
lution of the FFT spectrum when using the same length of time window, therefore making
WVD more suitable than FFT for shorter time series. However, WVD has another prob-
lem: if there are two frequency peaks f1 and f2 close to each other, the WVD spectrum also contains small but significant erroneous components at the frequencies f1 − f2 and f1 + f2. In the case of multiple dominant frequency peaks, the background of WVD spectrum can
be contaminated by many spurious frequency peaks of low amplitude. This feature of the
WVD method forces us to be careful when interpreting the finer details of the spectrum.
The cross-terms can be suppressed by introducing a suitable non-trivial kernel function K
in Equation 2.5, but unfortunately at the price of lower frequency resolution. One example
of such a kernel function is the so-called exponential distribution.

2.4.7.3  Complex Demodulation
The complex demodulation (CDM) method is a common non-linear method used to define the amplitude of a time series at a specified frequency or frequency band as a function of time (Kim and Euler, 1997). In other words, for a given frequency ω, we assume the signal is of the form

24

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

x (t) = A(t)cos(ω t + φ(t)) + z (t),

(2.6)

for which we need to determine the amplitude A(t) and the phase ϕ(t). The term z(t) contains all other oscillating components (having a frequency different from ω) and possible noise. In the CDM method, the original real value signal x(t) is rewritten into complex
format

{ } ( ) ( ) x t = 0.5A t e i(ωt+φ(t)) + e−i(ωt+φ(t)) + z (t) ,

(2.7)

where i is the imaginary unit. In the next step, all frequency components are shifted by −ω. This operation is equivalent to multiplying x(t) by the term

y (t) = 2e−iωt ,

(2.8)

which gives us

x′ (t) = A (t) eiφ(t) + ( ) A t e−i(2ωt+φ(t)) + 2z (t) e−iωt.

(2.9)

Here, we see that the frequency of the first term is zero and the frequency of the second
term is twice that of the component under study. The last term does not contain frequen-
cies around zero, because the component z(t) did not originally contain the frequency ω. If the signal x′(t) is fed into a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency at zero, we get the signal

x′′ (t) = A (t) eiφ(t),

(2.10)

from which we can easily calculate the slowly and time-dependently changing amplitude A(t) since A(t) = |x″(t)|. Likewise, we can get the amplitude of any desired frequency signal as a function of time (by varying ω). If the cutoff frequency is Δω and not exactly zero, the CDM method picks from the signal only the amplitude of those components with a frequency between ω − Δω and ω + Δω. In this way, it is possible to pick the part of the signal that belongs, for example, to the LF or HF band.
Therefore, theoretically, the CDM method can give the amplitude at every moment of time, but in reality, the temporal resolution depends upon the characteristics of the lowpass filter. If the desired frequency band is to be limited as steeply as possible, one needs to use a higher-order filter, but in that case, one needs more data points to perform filtering, and the time resolution will be lower. In practice, time resolution of the CDM method applied to the RR interval time series is approximately 15 s when analyzing oscillations in the LF band. Any faster changes in the amplitude of oscillations cannot be clearly distinguished. This temporal resolution is, however, clearly better than the resolution obtained with other methods.
The CDM amplitudes of the RR interval data (the same time series as in Figure 2.1) in the LF and HF bands are shown in Figure 2.6. Again we see that there are significant changes in the LF component, but the HF component is almost constant.

2.4.7.4  Other Methods
In the method of sliding window analysis, the Fourier transform can be replaced with AR modeling. If there are significant changes in the structure of HRV data as a function of time, the optimal model order should be obtained individually in each window. A similar approach called time-variant autoregressive modeling is suitable for online monitoring (Bianchi et al., 1997). In this method, a new set of AR parameters is computed whenever a new sample value is available, and the weight of the previous samples is controlled by means of a forgetting factor.
The Wavelet transform is a general tool for analyzing the temporal changes in time series (Figliola and Serrano, 1997). The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of the time series x(t) is defined as

(2.11)

where Ψ(t) is the basic (or mother) wavelet. The wavelet transform, similar to STFT, maps a time function into a two-dimensional function of a and τ. The parameter a is called the scale*; it scales the wavelet function by compressing or stretching it. τ is the translation of the wavelet function along the time axis. There are an infinite number of valid wavelet functions, but all of them are well localized.† By contrast, the STFT uses truncated sine waves, which are not well localized. The shape of the wavelet function must be selected according to the application. Furthermore, by increasing the window width in STFT, the
* Inverse of the scale can be interpreted as a frequency. † The wavelet is well localized since it goes rapidly to zero in infinity.

26

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

number of periods increases, but in the wavelet transform, basic shape of the wavelet is same; it is only compressed or stretched. All of these features of wavelets make them ideal for capturing rapid temporal changes. Although wavelet analysis has been applied to the HRV signal, results are not superior to those obtained using more traditional approaches (Wiklund et al., 1997).

2.5  Non-Linear Analysis
2.5.1  Approximate Entropy and Sample Entropy
All frequency domain analyses are based on the recognition of certain predetermined patterns. For instance, in Fourier transforms, the pattern is a sinusoidal wave, and in wavelet analysis, the pattern is a certain wavelet function. Another alternative for characterizing the variability of heart rate is to measure the regularity or complexity of the fluctuations without specifying the form of repeating patterns. Entropy is a general approach for quantifying the regularity or information content of the data (Pincus and Goldberger, 1994; Pincus, 1995; Bettermann and van Leeuwen, 1998; Cysarz et al., 2000). There are many ways to determine the entropy of a time series, but most of them require noise-free data and very long recordings. Approximate entropy (ApEn) has been developed for measuring the complexity of relatively short time series and it is most useful for HRV analysis where long noise-free recordings are difficult to obtain (Pincus and Goldberger, 1994). Furthermore, ApEn calculations are not based on specific assumptions regarding the internal structure or dynamics of the system.
ApEn is computed as follows. First we construct the so-called pseudo phase space vectors from the initial time series x(i), in which i = 1 … N, N being the number of data points

u(i) = x (i), x (i + 1), x (i + 2),..., x (i + m − 1) ,

(2.12)

m being the so-called embedding dimension.* Vectors u(i) can be interpreted as m-point patterns. First, we select one m-point pattern and search for similar m-point patterns. Two patterns are similar when the maximum distance d between the corresponding components is less than the tolerance r (Figure 2.7):

{ } d u(i), u(j) = max u(i + k) − u(j + k) : 0 ≤ k ≤ m − 1 ≤ r .

(2.13)

The (normalized) number of similar vectors u(j), which are at a distance r from u(i), is
{ } Ci(m) (r) = the number of index j for which, j ≤ N − m + 1, d u(i), u( j) ≤ r (N − m + 1).
(2.14)

* The use of pseudo phase vectors is a starting point of many non-linear analysis methods. The idea of these vectors is that they can be used as a replacement for the set of true dynamical variables, all of which we cannot measure either for technical reasons or since we actually do not know them. Under certain assumptions, the dynamics of the pseudo phase vectors is similar to the real dynamical variables.

that is, the distance between x(28) and x(33) and the distance between x(29) and x(34) are both < tolerance value r. Therefore, both u(28) and u(33) increase the quantity C23(2)(r). However, when m is increased to 3, only vector [x(33), x(34), x(35)] is similar to [x(23), x(24), x(25)] and increases C23(3)(r).

Due to normalization, the maximum value of C is 1, and C can be regarded as the probability of finding similar m-point patterns. The same analysis can be performed for all m-patterns. The logarithmic average of probabilities over all m-patterns is

ApEn (m, r, N) = Φm (r) − Φm+1 (r).

(2.16)

One sees that ApEn measures the (logarithmic) conditional probability that similar m-patterns are similar also when looking for (m + 1)-patterns. In other words, ApEn is the averaged probability of finding m-patterns minus the averaged probability of finding (m + 1)-patterns (see Figure 2.7). If the last probability is equal to the first one, ApEn = 0, i.e., the time series is absolutely regular in this sense. However, if the last probability is zero, ApEn gets its maximum value, i.e., the time series is totally irregular.
ApEn(m,r,N) is dependent on three parameters: the length m of the vectors being compared, the tolerance parameter r, and the number N of data points. This means that direct comparisons always require fixing of parameters. For HRV analysis, m = 2 is the value normally used. When the number of data points is increased, ApEn approaches its final value asymptotically. In practice, N > 800 and m = 2 give a reliable result. ApEn depends strongly on the tolerance parameter r. If r is chosen such that it is a fraction of the SD of the data, ApEn does not depend on absolute variability.* The most frequently used value of r is 15 or 20% of SD.
ApEn is sensitive to smallest trends in the data, because comparison of patterns is based on the absolute values of data. The trend can be removed before ApEn analysis but with

* If r is a fraction of SD, ApEn does not depend on the unit of data, and therefore, it is also possible to compare the ApEn values of different signals, such as RR interval and systolic pressure time series.

cautions as described in Section 2.2.5. One alternative is to use the differentiated data (the difference of successive RR intervals) that eliminate all slow trends, but this operation behaves like a special high-pass filter in the frequency domain. ApEn is not sensitive to changes in single data values if the tolerance parameter is fixed, but if the tolerance parameter is bound to the SD as recommended, the situation could well be different. Ectopic beats especially, if not edited, can alter the SD significantly.
When calculating the number of similar vectors to get ApEn, the similarity of the vector to itself is included in the calculation. This ensures that Ci(m)(r) is non-zero, which is essential for calculating the logarithm. This causes ApEn to give a result most of the time, which implies greater regularity of the signal than may be present.
Sample entropy (SampEn) is calculated in a way that removes the previously described bias (Richman and Moorman, 2000). When calculating the number of nearby vectors, a comparison to the vector itself is prevented:

{ } Ci′m (r) = the number of index j for which, j ≠ i, j ≤ N − m + 1, d u(i), u( j) ≤ r (N − m + 1).

The average of the probabilities Φ is also defined without logarithms

∑ Φm (r) = (N − m + )1 −1

Ci′m (r).

i=1

(2.18)

Now SampEn is defined as
( ) SampEn (m, r, N) = ln Φm (r) Φm+1 (r) .

(2.19)

The interpretation and use of SampEn remain exactly the same as for ApEn. However, the dependence on the tolerance parameter r and the number of data points N is different. ApEn reaches its maximum with a certain value of r, but SampEn decreases monotonically as r increases. SampEn is, in principle, also independent of the number of data points N, but with small values of N, its statistical reliability is naturally poor. When r and N are large enough, SampEn and ApEn yield the same result. SampEn provides a more reliable estimate of the complexity of a signal compared to ApEn. It may be used for considerably shorter time series than the ApEn, (<200 points).
Regularity and complexity are often interpreted as being contrary to each other: increased regularity means lower complexity and vice versa, but this is not always true. The degree of regularity can be quantified by evaluating the appearance of repetitive patterns and characterized by entropy measures. Complexity is, however, intuitively associated with meaningful structural richness, which can exhibit relatively high regularity. Entropy-based measures grow monotonically with the degree of randomness and they reach highest values from totally uncorrelated random data or white noise. Such data are unpredictable but not actually complex. Thus, entropy measures may lead to misleading results when they are applied to physiological time series such as the heart rate signal. For example, atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with highly erratic fluctuations with statistical properties resembling uncorrelated noise. The entropy value of such

a signal is high. By contrast, healthy cardiac rhythms that are regulated by multiple interacting feedback mechanisms will yield lower entropy values. This inconsistency is obviously related to the fact that entropy measures are based on single-scale analysis, but many biological systems operate across multiple spatial and temporal scales and hence their complexity is also multiscaled.
To overcome the aforementioned difficulties in interpreting entropy measures, multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis has been introduced (Costa et al., 2002, 2005). In this method, the coarse-grained time series determined by the scale factor τ is defined as

jτ

( ) ∑ y(τ) j = 1

x(i) ,

τ i=(j−1)τ+1

(2.20)

where x(i) is the original time series and 1 ≤ j ≤ N/τ. For a scale of 1, the time series y(j) is simply the original time series. The length of y(j) is equal to the length of the original time series divided by the scale factor. In the next step, the entropy of the coarse-grained time series is calculated as a function of the scale factor. In principle, the entropy can be calculated using any method that is reliable for a time series of variable length, and SampEn is a good choice when analyzing the RR interval time series. In order to have good statistical reliability at higher scales, the number of data points must be greater than 10,000. This limits the use of MSE in many clinical studies.
As an example, the MSE method has been applied to three different subjects: one healthy, one with congestive heart failure (CHF) and one with AF (see Figure 2.8). At the scale of 1, the healthy and CHF cases cannot be separated, but if the scale is 5 or 6, large separation can be obtained. Entropy of AF time series is highest at a scale of 1, but it decreases monotonically as the time scale increases, similar to white noise. At a very large time scale, CHF and AF time series cannot be separated any more. We conclude that MSE can distinguish these cases, but it needs computation of the entropy as a function of scale; no single entropy value at a fixed scale is enough.

2.5.2  Scaling Exponents
2.5.2.1  Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
When analyzing a longer time series lasting several hours, identification of oscillatory components or repeated patterns are not the best approach for examining the HRV data. One method is to characterize the internal correlations of the signal. These correlations are expressed by scaling properties and fractal structures. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) presents a possibility for characterizing this as a function of correlation distance (Peng et al., 1993, 1995; Iyengar et al., 1996).
To calculate DFA, we must first form an integrated version of the original time series x(i), where i = 1 … N, which gives us

k
∑ y (k) = (x (i)− < x >), i=1

(2.21)

where <x> is the mean of the original time series and k = 1 … N. Next, we divide the time series y(k) into equally spaced segments with length n as shown in Figure 2.9. For each
segment, we calculate separately the local trend by fitting a regression line yn(k) to the segment. The RMS (root-mean-square) fluctuation of the integrated time series is calculated
by removing the linear trend of each segment. Thus,

∑ DFA(n) =

1 N

y (k) − yn (k) 2 .

k=1

(2.22)

In the summation, we must take into account that when the index k is stepped, yn(k) must be updated when moving into the next segment. DFA is calculated for several different segment lengths, that is, n values. Typically, DFA increases when the segment length increases. If log(DFA) increases linearly as a function of log(n), the time series follows (fractal) scaling law, and in this case, the slope α of the linear change, the scaling exponent,

A typical DFA of long RRI time series is shown in Figure 2.10. A heartbeat has shortrange correlations reflecting the baroreflex mechanism, as well as long-range correlations, which are related to the efforts to keep the variation of the beat cycle within certain limits. The measurement of the long range correlations requires that the time series under investigation be preferably at least a few hours long so that the statistical reliability would be at least reasonable. The limit for short- and long-range correlations is set typically to 10 or 11 beats (corresponding to 2.4 on the logarithmic scale). The longrange scaling exponent αL for a healthy patient is ≈ 1, which corresponds to 1/f behavior. The short-range scaling exponent αS may vary, but it is usually between 0.5 and 1.5. Many factors affect it, such as the functioning of the baroreflex mechanism, breathing modulation and so on. With a longer time series, there always exists the possibility that the measured correlations are not at all a characteristic of the system but rather reflect environmental effects.

2.5.2.2  Spectrum Power Law Exponent
Long-range correlations of a time series may also be analyzed using the spectrum of the signal. In this case, we can study the lowest-frequency components of the spectrum and try to characterize its shape using simple exponential law. If we presume that for a certain frequency spectrum we have 1/f β, the scaling exponent β can be calculated by presenting the spectrum on a log–log scale and by fitting a line over the desired frequency range (Iyengar et al., 1996; Bigger et al., 1996). The slope of the line gives the spectrum power law exponent. The value of the exponent varies between 0 and 2. The border line case 0 corresponds to a flat spectrum, that is, white noise, and the value 2 corresponds to Brownian noise. Usually, the frequency range 0.0001–0.01 Hz of the spectrum is studied, and this corresponds to an oscillation period of 1 min to several hours. For the above definition to make sense, the HRV time series must be several hours long. The spectrum is calculated almost without exception using the FFT algorithm. Because the spectrum has a rather irregular form, especially at the lowest frequencies, the use of some smoothing method is desirable. Replacing the regression line with a less sensitive fitting method may also improve the reliability of the result.

2.5.3  Fractal Dimensions
2.5.3.1  Correlation Dimension
The dynamics of a system can be described by measuring its attractor (the path toward which the system converges) dimension. Especially for chaotic systems, the attractor can be fractal, in which case its dimension is not an integer. Knowing the dimension of the attractor may also help getting useful information about the characteristics of underlying systems. The correlation dimension (CD) is one of the simplest methods for estimating the attractor dimension (Grassberger and Procaccia, 1983; Kantz and Schreiber, 1995; Yum et al., 1999). The CD is sometimes referred to with the designation D2.
The basis for the calculations once again is in the reconstruction of time series in the multidimensional phase space x(i), where i = 1 … N, by using the vectors of the pseudo phase space u(i) = [x(i), x(i + 1), x(i + 2), … , x(i + m − 1)], where m is the embedding dimension. Next, we calculate for each vector u(i), how many attractor points are at a distance r as measured from the observation point

{ } Cim (r) = the number of index j for which, j ≤ N − m + 1, d u(i), u( j) ≤ r (N − m + 1) ,
(2.23)

where the distance d is defined (i.e., differing from the ApEn method) as the normal Euclidian distance

Next, we calculate the mean of the quantities Cim(r) over all vectors, from which we compute the so-called correlation integral

(2.26)

In practice, with limited data sets, these limits cannot be calculated with certainty and therefore the CD is defined as the slope of the regression line calculated from a log–log representation and over a range with the required linearity.
When calculating CD, the embedding dimension m must be selected so that it is at least 2D, where D is the dimension of the system under study, that is, the number of real dynamical variables. In order for the correlation integral to describe the attractor accurately, the number of data points should exceed 10m. For example, when studying the blood pressure regulation system, we may assume that the number of dynamical variables is >4, which means that the time series must be very long. In addition, it is nearly impossible to find such a range of the distance r, in which log Cm(r) changes linearly as a function of log r, because of the noise contained in the data and non-stationarity of the data. Due to these limitations, the calculation of the correct CD for biosignals is computationally not easily achieved. Despite this fact, computation of the correlation dimension may still be useful. Promising results have been achieved by using m = 20 and by searching for the mean slope within 0.01 < Cm(r) < 0.1. The quantity calculated in the above fashion without forgetting the aforementioned limitations is called the modified correlation dimension. This quantity cannot accurately define the real dimension of the system, but nevertheless, it does give a measure of the complexity of the system, that is, when CD increases, the system becomes more complex.

2.5.3.2  Pointwise Correlation Dimension
Pointwise correlation dimension (CDi) is defined in a very similar way compared to CD, but instead of labeling the time series with a single value, it is calculated as a function of time (Farmer et al., 1983; Mayer-Kress et al., 1988). This gives us the possibility of evaluating changes in the system characteristics as a function of time, which is very important in non-stationary cases. CDi is sometimes referred to as D2i.
When searching for the regression line, we must once again select the range in which the relation is linear and use a high enough embedding dimension value. When calculating the CDi, we can set m = 20 (similar to computing the CD above) and select the area 0.01 < CDi(r) < 0.1. In addition, we must note that even though CDi is calculated at each point and it can therefore in principle follow changes in data, the calculation of CDi at any point requires its calculation at all other points. For this reason, CDi is not applicable to non-stationary time series. Thus, in practice, it is advisable to use an additional condition that states that when calculating the regression line at each point in a log–log representation, the correlation factor of the achieved line must exceed a certain limit (e.g., 0.8), and if this criterion is not fulfilled, the CDi value at the point in question is not reliable.

2.5.3.3  Dispersion Analysis
Dimension analysis of a time series may also be performed by studying the curve describing the time series itself rather than the dynamical system behind the signal. This approach

34

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

toward analyzing RR intervals is similar to image analysis. Because complex behavior of the dynamical system manifests itself in complicated patterns in the measured time series, a study of the curve’s fractal structure will also give information regarding the system itself.
In dispersion-based analysis, we first calculate from the time series, the standard deviation

∑ ∑ SD(1)

=

1 N

N

N

2

N x2 (i) −  x (i) ,

i=1

 i=1



(2.27)

where x(i) is the time series having N data points. Next, we compute the mean of two consecutive data points, (for the entire time series) resulting in a new time series of N/2 data points. For this new time series, we again calculate the standard deviation SD(2). This is continued with group sizes 4, 16, 32 and so on until there are less than 4 data points left in the time series. By repeating the above process, we have a series of standard deviation values SD(m). When we plot log SD(m) as a function of log m, a line can be plotted through the points if the original time series curve was fractal. For this fractal object, the dimension is FD−DA = 1 – the slope of the line (Bassingthwaighte and Raymond, 1995; Yum et al., 1999). Fractal dimension defined in this way can have values between 1 and 1.5, where 1 represents the case of a steady-state signal and 1.5 represents maximal fractal characteristics.
If the curve under study is not purely fractal, that is, it contains a sizeable amount of noise, the SD(m) values do not exactly fit a line in log–log representation. For automated analysis when this line is not visually verified, one can set a minimal correlation of 0.8 as a measure of linearity.

2.5.4  Return Map
Dynamical systems are usually described by a group of differential equations. If the variables get values only at specific discrete moments in time, as is the case with the RR interval time series, the differential equations can be replaced with discrete equations, for example,

( ) xi+1 = F xi , yi , zi ,…
( ) yi+1 = G xi , yi , zi ,… ,
( ) zi+1 = H xi , yi , zi ,…

(2.28)

where x, y, z and so on are dynamical variables of the system and F, G, H, . . . are functions that define the dynamics. Usually, these functions are not known, but we may try to solve for them by examining the measured time series. If there is only a single variable, the equation is expressed in a simpler form:

xi+1 = F (xi ) .

(2.29)

Because this expression binds the new value xi+1 of the variable to its predecessor value xi, we can solve function F in principle, by pairing successive values of the time series, (xi, xi+1) for i = 1 to N − 1, and plotting them on a two-dimensional graph. This kind of a graph is called a return map.* If the dynamics of x is wholly determined by function F and there are enough data points, the method should reveal the shape of the function F.
If the dynamical system behind the time series is not one dimensional, suggesting that more than one variable has an impact on the system, a return map formed on the basis of a single measured variable naturally cannot solve functions F, G and so on. Even in such cases, a single variable return map may prove to be useful, although it is a certain type of projection of the multidimensional system into a single dimension. Figure 2.11 shows the return map of an RR interval time series. The points are typically scattered to form an ellipsoid but can also form complex structures. When the return map is an ellipsoid, it can be characterized by two quantities: the SD in the direction of the diagonal SD2 and the SD in a direction perpendicular to SD2, i.e., SD1† (Huikuri et al., 1996; Woo et al., 1994). These deviations are, by nature, measures of variability, since they quantify the movement of the system in a phase space. However, when the return map has a complex shape, above parameters do not describe the variability very well.

* This is also called Poincaré or Lorenz plot or map. † For RR interval, SD1 is the same as RMSSD 2.

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

2.5.5  Other Approaches
2.5.5.1  Stationarity Test
An example of a simple stationarity test that mainly measures changes in the baseline signal is as follows: the signal is divided into segments of suitable length and for each segment, the signal average is calculated. When SD of these averages is divided by the SD of complete signal, we get a measure of stationarity (Palazzolo et al., 1998). This measure is small if the signal is stationary. The length of the segment should be chosen so that it is not too long in order for the local changes to be detectable, but it cannot be too short either in order to prevent the averages of the segments from varying too much. For an RR interval time series, a good choice is to use 20 beats/segment. If the measure is < 0.3, the signal can be considered to be reasonably stationary.
2.5.5.2  Symbolic Dynamics
The basic idea of this method is to characterize the original time series with a much simpler and coarser symbolic notation which, however, retains the essential dynamic characteristics of the original time series. This is done by converting the time series into a string of symbols. By this, we reduce the study of dynamics into handling of a symbol string. Naturally we lose most of the information contained in the original time series, but nevertheless, we retain key dynamical features, in a coarse-grained form (Voss et al., 1995, 1996; Palazzolo et al., 1998).
The conversion of a time series into a symbol string may be done using several methods. One of them is described in Figure 2.12. The signal is divided into two or more value ranges, depending on how many symbols we wish to utilize. Value ranges may be absolute bands or based on signal averages or SD. For example, if we have four different symbols, we may use the following bands:
A signal ≤ average − SD B average − SD < signal ≤ average C average < signal ≤ average + SD D signal > average + SD

Methodological Aspects of Heart Rate Variability Analysis

37

After the bands have been selected, the time series can be converted into a symbol string. The next step involves grouping the symbols in the string into words. A word is always formed by stepping forward one step in the symbol string. If we choose a word length of 3 and we have 4 different symbols, we get altogether 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 different words. Each word corresponds to a specific graphical representation, which has at least a rough connection to the original dynamics. Different words do not have same probability because HRV dynamics favors certain words. The distribution of the words can thus be interpreted as a probability distribution. The shape of the distribution may itself act as a basis of further analysis, but it is also possible to measure the order related to the distribution in the terms of entropy. The simplest such measure is Shannon’s entropy.

2.5.5.3  Multifractal Analysis
A monofractal signal can be described using just one scaling exponent α or Hurst exponent h = α − 1, and in these situations, DFA, for example, is a valid method. If a signal is multifractal, a set or continuum of Hurst exponents is needed corresponding to a generalized fractal dimension D(h) (Ivanov et al., 1999; Amaral et al., 2001). Multifractal analysis is based on the wavelet transform (Equation 2.11) and the scaling properties of its local maximums (see computational details in Muzy et al., 1991). As a result, we get the fractal dimension as a function of the Hurst exponent.
A typical multifractal analysis of an RR interval time series of 25,000 data points of a healthy subject and a CHF subject is shown in Figure 2.13. In the healthy subject, D(h) has a peak at h = 0.1 (α = 1.1), and in the CHF subject, D(h) has a peak at h = 0.2 (α = 1.1). Thus, there is only a minor difference, and both cases resemble a 1/f type of dynamics (see Table 2.1). However, D(h) of the CHF subject has a very narrow span in h, corresponding almost to monofractal behavior, but the healthy subject has very wide D(h), indicating true multifractal dynamics. This result clearly reflects the common belief that the complexity of the system decreases as heart rate control degenerates.

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

2.5.5.4  Stochastic Modeling
The unpredictable portion of the heart rate fluctuation can be due to chaotic dynamics, but there is an alternative explanation: the system includes a real stochastic component. The basic idea behind stochastic modeling is that the unpredictable component is not a perturbation but an essential part of the dynamical behavior of the system. The source of this true noise can be physiological, or it may be a reflection of external disturbances. If the system is truly stochastic, it cannot be described by a deterministic model; rather a stochastic one is needed. Many stochastic systems can be described by the Langevin equation

g (X

(t)) +

(2.30)

where X(t) is the state of the system at moment t, and functions g and h represent the deter-
ministic and stochastic parts of the time evolution. Γ(t) is the uncorrelated white noise with zero mean and Gaussian distribution. It has been shown that the difference version of
Equation 2.30,

X (t + τ) = X (t) + g (X (t)) + h(X (t))Γ (t) ,

(2.31)

where τ is a finite delay parameter (2–20 min), can model the long-term RR interval time series (Kuusela, 2004; Kuusela et al., 2003). The control functions g and h can be extracted from the data by computing conditional probability distributions. In practice, 50,000–100,000 data points, that is, 12–24 h of RR intervals, are needed in order to determine these distributions reliably. Results from an analysis of 24 h recordings of RR interval are shown in Figure 2.14. At small (large) RR interval values, the deterministic part g is clearly positive (negative); this guarantees that the RR interval is kept within certain limits.* In the case of the healthy subject, typical g function has three zerocrossings (two stable fixed points and one unstable fixed point†) in the middle, but with the CHF subject, g function is flat, indicating a less complex dynamical control. The stochastic parts h have a complicated structure in both cases, but the mean level of the h function is smaller in the CHF subject, which can be interpreted as a lower stochasticity of the system.

2.6  Conclusions
Heart rate fluctuations can be analyzed using many different methods and approaches. No single method described here is clearly superior to other techniques, and therefore, it
* When the RR interval is small, the g function and also the derivative in Equation 2.30 are positive; thus, the RR interval increases. Similarly, when the RR interval is large, the g function and the derivative are negative; thus, the RR interval decreases.
† If we omit the stochastic part in Equation 2.30, the zeros of the g function correspond to the fixed points of the system. At the fixed points, the derivative is zero and the system has no tendency to change. Fixed points can be either stable and attract all nearby states or unstable and repel nearby states.

is recommended that researchers use several techniques in combination. The physiological interpretation of results is often difficult, especially in the case of non-linear methods and further investigation is needed. However, the time series analysis of RR interval data has proven to be useful and it has already gained significant clinical relevance. It would be very useful to agree on common rules or guidelines about when to use each method, the length of the time series needed, normative values and the kind of editing or filtering operations, so that the results from different laboratories can be compared.

3.1  Introduction
The essential task of the cardiovascular blood pressure control system is to deliver sufficiently high blood pressure to maintain various functions of the body and its organs. If the blood pressure is too low or too high, blood flow cannot be maintained. For example, when a person stands up, blood tends to stay in the lower body due to gravity and the blood pressure regulatory system must respond quickly in order to maintain sufficient blood flow to the brain. If response of the hemodynamic system is not quick, the person would faint almost immediately. The body must also adapt to a wide range of physical workloads in which muscles must receive a sufficient supply of oxygen-rich blood. Thus, a blood pressure control system that can maintain stable blood pressure in the face of rapidly changing demands is a fundamental requirement for our health.
The blood pressure regulatory system can be considered to be a feedback system, consisting of sensors (the baroreceptors that measure blood pressure at select locations in the body), a processing unit (residing in the central nervous system) and an output unit (the autonomic nervous system, which adjusts blood pressure by changing heart rate, cardiac contractility and resistance of the peripheral blood vessels). A diagram of this system is shown in Figure 3.1. Baroreceptors are specialized nerve cells, which measure blood pressure indirectly by sensing the stretch of blood vessels. Baroreceptors are abundant in aorta and carotid arteries and can also be found in larger veins. Put simply, blood pressure is regulated by adjusting heart rate and peripheral resistance according to the input from pressure-sensing baroreceptors. This system can compensate, within

certain limits and conditions, including changes in blood pressure imposed upon the body due to positional changes and exercise loads caused by different activities. In reality, the situation is certainly much more complex because both sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of the central nervous system adjust the overall system in many different ways. In addition, time scales of adjustments range from two consecutive heartbeats to several hours and even days. This chapter will focus on those parts of the blood pressure control system in which the response may be measured within few tens of seconds.
Baroreflexes operate not only to control abrupt changes in the arterial pressure but also to maintain different levels of steady-state pressure. Baroreflex activity can be studied in one of the two ways: either by studying heart rate responses to external perturbations, such as mechanical (e.g., using lower body negative pressure or neck suction) or pharmacological manipulations (e.g., vasoactive drugs) that produce sudden and large changes in blood pressure or by studying heart rate responses to spontaneous fluctuations in blood pressure. The difference between these two approaches is significant. When a strong external input is applied to baroreceptors by forcing a rapid change in the arterial pressure, changes in blood pressure are mainly determined by the external stimulus. In this situation, the relationship between blood pressure and heart rate are approximated by an open-loop model. By contrast, under conditions of spontaneous fluctuations in arterial pressure, all control mechanisms and feedback loops are fully active and an estimation of the baroreflex gain is based on a closed-loop model. Another difference is that in the first approach, full dynamic range of the system can be explored, while in the second approach, responses are limited to a smaller range around baseline conditions.
A measure of the capability of baroreflex to adjust heart rate to changing conditions is called baroreflexivity or baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). BRS is commonly measured as a ratio of the change in heart rate (quantified by its reciprocal, the RR interval) in response to a

fixed change in the blood pressure. Its unit is “ms/mmHg,” and is usually positive.* A higher BRS value indicates that the system strongly reacts to pressure changes, that is, the system is more sensitive. The idea behind BRS is to try to characterize the quality of operation of the entire blood pressure regulatory system with a single numerical value, which, by itself, is a tall order. Nevertheless, the BRS has been found to be a useful measure with clear diagnostic relevance. The goal of this chapter is to describe techniques used to measure the BRS.

3.2  Slope Method
This is the most traditional method used for measuring BRS and is used routinely in clinical medicine. The basic idea of this method is to perturb the blood pressure control system and measure the response to such a perturbation. The most common technique is to give an intravenous bolus of phenylephrine to raise the blood pressure or nitroprusside to lower the blood pressure, while simultaneously recording electrocardiogram and blood pressure waveforms.
Figure 3.2 shows the results of a typical phenylephrine test (the subject was a 56-year-old male). The systolic pressure increases and the heart rate correspondingly decreases, that is, the RR interval becomes longer. From an analytical point of view, the problem is how to select an area of interest, because exact moments of pressure rise and heart rate slowing may be difficult to define. Unfortunately, the estimated BRS value is sensitive to these choices.
The simplest way of calculating BRS would be to measure absolute changes in the systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and RR interval from a baseline, but the difficulty lies in defining the baseline. Instead, BRS is calculated by plotting the SAP and the corresponding RR interval as (x, y) value pairs and fitting a regression line. BRS is then defined as the slope of this regression line. Figure 3.3a shows such an (x, y) pair with a BRS of 1.46 ms/mmHg and a correlation coefficient of 0.947, which indicates a rather good fit. This method does, however, make a basic assumption. When the (x, y) pair is formed using simultaneous SAP and RR interval values, it is assumed that the system has no delay or that the delay is extremely short, that is, a change in the pressure would cause an immediate change in heart rate. Many studies have shown that the above assumption is not true.
Figures 3.3b, 3.3c and 3.3d show corresponding curves when the RR interval time series is shifted by two, four or six beats from the beat at which the blood pressure (BP) value was obtained. In this example, we can see that the correlation depends on the delay and has the highest value when the delay is four beats and is actually better than that with no delay. In this particular case, a delay of four beats corresponds to a delay of more than 3 s. It is unknown whether such a delay is due to an internal delay of the control system. On the other hand, different patients may have large differences in their response times, and
* Positive BRS means that the RR intervals lengthen when the blood pressure rises and vice versa. Under certain circumstances where the baroreflex system is not properly working, apparent BRS can momentarily be negative. When analyzing spontaneous small fluctuations of the RR intervals and SAP, it is not uncommon to see sequences of beats with lengthening (shortening) RR intervals and decreasing (increasing) SAP. These non-baroreflex influences can be important when characterizing the overall effectiveness of cardiac control.

therefore, analyzing the delay makes sense. As we can see from Figure 3.3, different delays produce varying values of the BRS.

3.3  Advanced Slope Method
The slope method described in the previous section may be used to estimate the delay at which the best fit between the SAP and RR interval values can be achieved, but such a delay cannot be measured in steps that are smaller than one beat. An improvement may be achieved by interpolating both time series and resampling them at a higher frequency and study the effects of smaller delays. However, this method also has its drawbacks because effects of interpolation are difficult to estimate. Since both RR intervals and SAP values are basically time series without underlying continuous signals, corresponding phase may not be preserved between them.
After interpolation and resampling, one could use (x, y) pairs to compute the BRS with different delays. But the search for an optimal delay that produces the highest correlation factor of the regression line would be tedious using manual methods. Instead, the analysis can be automated by calculating both the slope of the regression line and the correlation

coefficient as a function of delay. Figure 3.4 represents an example using such an approach. Both signals have been sampled at 20 Hz, in which case the delay may be adjusted in 50 ms steps. The result shows that the BRS (left panel) changes as a function of the delay and has a maximum between 2000 and 3000 ms. In practice, the shape of the function varies from one patient to another but often has a maximum.

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

The correlation coefficient in our example (right panel) has a maximum value at 2650 ms, where the BRS is 1.80 ms/mmHg. In this case, the BRS value would not change much even if we were to increase the delay; but this is not always the case and a maximum may lie in the part where the slope changes drastically, resulting in a strong dependence of the BRS on the delay. Even though an optimal delay between RR intervals and BP values defined earlier cannot be directly linked to a physiological mechanism, the method does present a unique way defining the delay and a corresponding BRS value. One should note that the selection of the area of interest in recorded waveforms still affects the final result. One may be able to further improve the method by optimizing (e.g., in terms of correlation) the starting and ending time points. However, it is not clear whether the maximum correlation would then correspond to a physiologically meaningful situation.

3.4  Sequence Method
In the sequence method, BRS is evaluated as described in the slope method in Section 3.2, but instead of concentrating on a singular pressure rise or fall, the calculation is performed multiple times during a recording (Bertinieri et al., 1988; Parati et al., 1988; Hughson et al., 1993; Parlow et al., 1995). In this case, the pressure rise and fall are not externally induced. Instead, naturally occurring fluctuations of these signals are utilized.
There are certain conditions that must be satisfied before we accept a sequence for BRS calculations. First, in the sequence to be used, both SAP and RR interval signals must rise or fall monotonically in the same direction for at least three beats. Normally, one uses RR intervals that have been advanced by a beat in order to compensate for an assumed adjustment delay between the blood pressure and the corresponding RR interval. Second, each consecutive change of SAP and RR intervals must exceed a certain preset value. This condition acts as a filter, which removes random noise related changes and affects how many acceptable sequences are found. The preset value is chosen empirically on a case-by-case basis.* A minimum change of 0.5 mmHg in SAP and a change of 1 ms in RR interval may be used to begin with. These values correspond to typical resolution in the measurement of these signals. In the sequence method, one usually analyzes the rising (BRS Up-Up) and falling (BRS Down-Down) sequences separately, since underlying physiological mechanisms are assumed to be different, mainly because of asymmetry between baroreceptor stimulation and deactivation.
Figure 3.5 contains a short stretch of simultaneously recorded SAP and RR intervals with a rising sequence that fulfills above requirements. A regression line is fitted to the SAP (x) and RR interval (y) values belonging to the sequence. The slope of the regression line gives the BRS value. When the whole time series is analyzed in a similar fashion, often acceptable sequences are found only intermittently, as shown in Figure 3.6.† In this example, the length of almost all valid sequences is three beats and only a few have a length of four beats. BRS values calculated using the sequence method typically have a
* The minimum acceptable change of RR interval and SAP should be as small as possible in order to get the maximal number of regression lines, but the limits should not be too small, because false sequences may be generated due to noise within the signals. Limits close to the resolution of the signals are normally a good starting point.
† BRS by the sequence method is not continuous in such a sense that it cannot be determined for each heartbeat.

FIGURE 3.5 In the sequence method, sequences with a minimum of three consecutive rising (or falling) values in SAP and RR interval values are identified. To be considered valid, the consecutive values must exceed a present limit of ΔSAPmin and ΔRRImin. For each sequence, SAP[n] and RR[n + 1] interval values are interpreted as an (x, y) pair data to which a regression line is fitted. The slope of the line is the BRS value at that time point.

large standard deviation. Only 15%–20% of all heartbeats may yield acceptable sequences for estimating the BRS, although other beats may contain useful information. The percentage of acceptable sequences of all heartbeats, typically 15%–20%, may also contain useful information.
The BRS values acquired using the sequence method differ from BRS values acquired using phenylephrine-based tests because both definitions and methods of computation are significantly different. During intravenous drug challenge, blood pressure is strongly perturbed and the system may be considered to have shifted, albeit temporarily, to a different operating point. By contrast, for the sequence method, the system is allowed to oscillate freely around a stable operating point. Another issue to consider is the source of these naturally occurring fluctuations. Detailed research suggests that most of these oscillations are caused by breathing, which modulates both blood pressure and heartbeat signals. An example of a BRS computation (Up-Up sequence of heartbeats) and the corresponding respiratory flow (to a metronomic breathing set at 15 breaths/min) signal are shown in Figure 3.7. The beginning of each valid sequence marked by a vertical dotted line coincides with the peak flow of the expiratory phase (positive values of the flow signal). Consequently, results acquired using the sequence method may depend on the depth of breathing and the breathing frequency. The number of valid sequences is affected by both these respiratory variables. If the heart rate is low, the RR interval is >1 s and breathing occurs in phase with a metronome (e.g., in this instance, set to 4 s intervals), sometimes sequences in practice do not contain three consecutive rising data values, in which case an evaluation of BRS is not possible.

3.5  Spectral Methods
The baroreflex mechanism may also be studied using the power spectra of both RR interval and SAP signals (de Boer et al., 1985, 1987; Robbe et al., 1987; Airaksinen et al., 1997; Herpin and Ragot, 1997). Figure 3.8 shows the spectra of both signals computed using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Both spectra consist of two major frequency bands. The first is modulated by breathing (HF), which, in this example, was set at 0.25 Hz (corresponding to a 4 s time period) using a metronome. The second frequency band is due to an oscillation related to the pressure regulatory mechanism, with a frequency of about 0.1 Hz (corresponding to a 10 s time period). In addition, it is also possible to observe oscillations with a period of 1–2 min (frequency band around 0.0167 Hz), which may be correlated with the body’s temperature regulation system or other hormonal control mechanisms (Kitney and Rompelman, 1977).
Power spectrum of the heart rate and blood pressure signal is divided into different bands according to physiological mechanisms and experimental evidence. Researchers have assigned fast, mainly breathing-related components to the HF band (0.15–0.4 Hz). Adjustments primarily related to the sympathetic nervous system are thought to be reflected in the LF band (0.04–0.15 Hz). The rest of the power relates to slow changes occurring in the VLF band (0.003–0.04 Hz). If the recording time is long (>30 min), it is also possible to define frequency components belonging to the ULF band (<0.003 Hz). The condition of whether the breathing component actually lies in the HF band depends on the test setup. Without a metronome, the natural frequency of breathing may be low (~6/min or at 0.1 Hz), causing the respiratory component to shift to the LF band.
Because the power spectrum reflects the strength of different frequency components in a signal, the absolute height of a specific peak might be used as a measure of particular

components; but, in practice, this is not recommended.* One reason could be that the absolute height of the peak may vary depending on the algorithm used for calculating the power spectral density. It is also possible that the desired band may contain more than a single peak. A better way of assessing the relative effect of a certain frequency component in a signal is to calculate the integral of the spectrum over a certain frequency band. This is a natural approach as the integral over the whole spectrum gives variance, and its square root corresponds to the standard deviation of the signal under consideration, in time domain.
Spectral BRS may be defined in many ways. A possible choice is to use the power in LF band:

BRSLF =

RRI power in LF band . SAP power in LF band

(3.1)

If we assume that the blood pressure is regulated mainly by LF band oscillations, this definition is intuitive. Because spectral power of RRI is represented by ms2 and that of SAP is measured in mmHg2, the BRSLF is represented as ms/mmHg. In the example provided in Figure 3.8, BRSLF = 8.2 ms/mmHg.
The approach described above does not guarantee that the oscillations in the RR interval and SAP signals would in any way be synchronized or are even correlated with each other. For example, if during a recording, a “real” oscillation appears at the beginning in the RR interval but not in the SAP and the opposite occurs at the end of the recording, the BRS calculation described above will give a spurious estimate. In order to ascertain that both the signals have same frequency components and that their phase relationships are taken into consideration, we need to calculate both coherence and phase difference as a function of frequency between the two signals. Figure 3.9 shows the coherence between SAP and RR interval signals. Coherence indicates how two signals correlate at a certain frequency. Coherence values range from 0 to 1. A coherence value of 1 indicates that the signals behave more coherently in that frequency band. In the example shown in Figure 3.9, coherence is high corresponding to the 10 s oscillation period (0.1 Hz) and also at the breathing frequency. From these results, one can conclude that at these frequencies both the SAP and RR interval signals oscillate similar to each other.† It must be noted that the coherence does not indicate how strong the oscillations are but merely measures their similarity. For example, high values of coherence can be observed on the right of the HF peak, but the spectra in Figure 3.8 show that there are no significant components at these frequency bands. We can now redefine BRS as

BRSC =

RRI power in LF band over those frequencies where coherence > 0.5 SAP power in LF band over those frequencies where coherence > 0.5

(3.2)

The basic idea of this definition is to integrate spectral density only over those frequency bands in which coherence exceeds a certain limit, usually 0.5. This guarantees that the integral will not contain bands in which oscillations are not synchronized.

* See details of spectral calculations in Chapter 2. † When two signals oscillate coherently on a certain frequency band, it means that the amplitudes of both sig-
nals have the same time dependence and the phase difference is constant. It does not mean that both signals have the same phase.

The use of coherence greater than 0.5 does not guarantee that changes in the SAP would occur before changes in RR interval, although that is what we would expect on the basis of general principles of blood pressure control system. A plot of phase differences between the two signals as a function of frequency is shown in Figure 3.10. We can observe that the phase difference is negative in the LF band. This implies that changes in the SAP preceded changes in the RR interval as expected. On the other hand, the phase difference at the breathing frequency is nearly 0, from which we can conclude that oscillations of the SAP and RR interval signals are in phase. We can further conclude that breathing seems to affect both signals simultaneously. These observations give clear indications regarding the nature of the blood pressure regulation system. Now we can define a new BRS parameter:

BRSCP =

RRI power in LF band where coherence > 0.5 and phase < 0 SAP power in LF band where coherence > 0.5 and phase < 0

(3.3)

Nevertheless, it should be noted that even these improved spectral methods used for the calculation of BRS do not guarantee that there is any causality between the SAP and RR interval signals, because a phase difference defines only the phase relationship between the two signals and not which signal leads the other. In practice, this is not a major limitation, since based on our knowledge of cardiac physiology, the SAP signal is the independent variable.
BRS may also be defined as a function of frequency without calculating the power spectra but using the transfer function. The basic assumption in transfer function–based analysis is that the system under investigation may be modeled as a linear system in which

the SAP signal is the input and the RR interval signal is the output. Then, the transfer function indicates the gain of the system at each frequency. It indicates the strength of the output signal (RR interval) when a specific change occurs in the input signal (SAP). The transfer function, therefore, is mathematically equivalent to BRS and has the same unit as BRS (ms/mmHg). Figure 3.11 is an example of a typical transfer function. The transfer function does contain useful information about the system, from an engineering perspective, but to gain any clinical use one must somehow specify a reduced set of easily comparable quantities. The best method is probably to calculate the mean value of the transfer function over those frequencies (within the LF band) where the coherence value exceeds 0.5.

3.6  Complex Demodulation Method
Complex demodulation (CDM) method is a non-linear method used to define the amplitude of a time series as a function of frequency or a frequency band (Hayano et al., 1993; Kim and Euler, 1997). In other words, if the signal to be studied is given by the equation,

x (t) = A(t)cos(ω t + φ(t)) + z (t) ,

(3.4)

we must determine the time-dependent amplitude A and phase ϕ. The term z(t) contains all other oscillating components (having a frequency different from ω) and possible noise. The computational method for determining the amplitude A by CDM is described in
Chapter 2. By varying the parameter ω and the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter, we can estimate the amplitude of any frequency component or a frequency band, as a function
of time from the signal to be analyzed.
When the CDM method is applied to RR interval and SAP signals with a center fre-
quency ω = 0.09 Hz and a cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter set at Δω = 0.05 Hz, the CDM method chooses the LF band components. When the amplitude of the RR interval
signal estimated in this way is divided by the amplitude of the SAP signal, it results in a
novel method of calculating BRS. Figure 3.12 shows an example of results based on such
an analysis. The BRS values computed using CDM are quite stable, with values around
10 ms/mmHg. There are occasional high BRS values. If the amplitude of the SAP signal

drops in the LF band, it usually causes a peak in the BRS since the SAP amplitude is the denominator in the BRS formula. In this method there is no control over whether the signals are coherent with respect to each other or whether a change in the SAP signal precedes a change in the RR interval. The essential idea is that the amplitude of both signals at low frequencies are compared at each specific moment in time. An advantage of this method is that it has a high temporal resolution of about 15 s. This is better than the resolution that can be achieved using any of the spectral methods described in Section 3.5.

3.7  Autoregressive Moving Average Analysis
If one wants to analyze the baroreflex mechanism in more detail than provided by previous methods, another option is to model the blood pressure regulatory system. Because a realistic physiological model is inevitably very complex, one must make certain assumptions and simplifications. A natural starting point in such a case is a linear model referred to as the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach (O’Leary et al., 1999; Patton et al., 1996). This section describes such a model consisting of two input signals, SAP and RSP (respiratory) time series, and one output signal, which is the RR interval time series. We can generalize this as

L

M

N

∑ ∑ ∑ ( ) RRIk = aiRRIk−i + biSAPk−i + ciRSPk−i + e k .

i=1

i= M0

i = N0

(3.5)

The first term on the right side of the equation is the autoregressive (AR) component and the next two terms form the MA (moving average) components. The basic idea of the model is that the new RR interval depends linearly on the previous RR intervals, SAP and RSP values. The last term represents the noise, which is uncorrelated with the signal. The fundamental purpose of the ARMA analysis is to fit the model with the data under investigation. If the model order parameters L, M and N and delays M0 and N0 are fixed, the calculations can be easily performed using, for example, the method of least squares, in which case one gets the best values for the coefficients ai, bi and ci. In general, those model orders and delays are not known in advance. Several different strategies have been

56

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

proposed for determining the optimal set of parameters (Perrot and Cohen, 1996), but details of these methods are beyond the scope of this chapter. It suffices to say that, in general, the problem is quite complex. One option is simply to fix the model orders and delays and use the same basic model for all analyses. In such a case, that the model may deemed to be too simple to explain the signal under investigation. On the other hand, if the model order is very high, it may erroneously try to model the noise contained within the signal. The basic idea is to try to determine a model that is as simple as possible and yet will explain the signal under investigation as completely as possible. Under such conditions, the term e(k) in Equation 3.5 will contain only white noise. It should be noted that if the real system is, in fact, non-linear, even the best ARMA model would not be able to describe output signal adequately.
After estimating the order of AR and MA terms and corresponding delays and coefficients, the model may also be used to evaluate BRS. In principle, the factor b1 corresponds to the relationship between RR interval and SAP signals, thus representing an estimate of the BRS. In reality, however, coefficients of the model may vary significantly, although signals themselves might not. Because of such variations, a better approach is to investigate the system impulse response. The impulse response is not easily affected by minor variations in various signals. When calculating the impulse response, the SAP signal is set as a pressure pulse of 1 mmHg, with a length of one beat, after which the response in the RR interval signal is calculated using the ARMA model. This type of impulse response investigation actually corresponds to a simulated phenylephrine test. Figure 3.13 is an example of an impulse response. In Equation 3.5, model order for the AR component was set at 8. The model was unstable for higher model orders and significantly lower model orders could not generate any clear response. The model order for the SAP component was increased until no change in the output was observed and the final value was 18. The model order for respiration volume did not affect the output much and it was fixed at 4. The delays M0 and N0 were 1. Figure 3.13 shows that the RR interval increases immediately after the pressure pulse is applied. It reaches a maximum after a delay of approximately 2 s and then decays gradually. BRS is defined as the maximum value reached following the application of impulse input. Another method of calculating the BRS using the ARMA

57

model is to calculate the response to a step pulse, which is, in fact, the time integral of the impulse response.
The ARMA model is, in principle, perhaps an optimal method to estimate the BRS because, on one hand, the model takes into account time-related delays and causality, and on the other hand, it may well be sensitive to the selection of model order and delays. In addition, the usability of a model requires that the system explores its phase space, in order for the linear model to quantitatively describe the characteristics of the system. This requirement may be better fulfilled by regulating the breathing rate such that the breathing frequency spectrum resembles a white noise distribution. In practice, breathing at widely varying frequencies in a controlled manner is rather difficult and which by itself may fundamentally alter the system under investigation. It is also possible to use spontaneous variation of an individual subject’s breathing pattern, but in such an instance, inter-subject variability could pose problems.

3.8  Conclusions
Physiological and clinical significance of assessing BRS has been demonstrated in many studies on cardiovascular homeostasis in health and in disease. BRS can be quantified in many ways, such as measuring the response to an external stimuli or by utilizing spontaneous fluctuations in RR interval and instantaneous arterial blood pressure signals. These methods are not mutually exclusive but should be used together to study the autonomic regulation of blood pressure. Results of computing BRS based on either time or frequency domain are not directly comparable to each other. In summary, one may state that they represent two distinct methods used to study the regulation of blood pressure in clinical medicine.

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

4.1  Arterial Blood Pressure
The arterial blood pressure (ABP) is a measure of the pressure (force per unit area) of blood against the walls of arteries. It is commonly expressed as two numerical values: the maximum pressure measured during contraction of ventricles, that is, systole (systolic blood pressure [SBP]), and the minimum pressure measured during relaxation of ventricles, that is, diastole (diastolic blood pressure [DBP]). Pulse pressure (PP) is the difference between SBP and DBP.
PP = SBP – DBP.
4.1.1  Measuring ABP: Continuous and Non-Continuous Methods—Invasive versus Non-Invasive Methods
For most of our history, we have only been able to obtain discrete values of ABP, namely, SBP and DBP, using the non-invasive method of auscultation (the Riva-Rocci method) that we are all familiar with (Guyton and Hall, 2000). The oscillometric method (Webster, 1997) is also non-invasive and produces discrete ABP measurements. Conversely, continuous measurement of ABP has been undoubtedly associated with invasiveness, because insertion of a pressure sensor inside the blood vessel by way of arterial catheterization was the only method available for obtaining continuous ABP measurement until almost the end of twentieth century.
4.1.2  Traditional Clinical Assessment of the Arterial Pressure
Although the shape of continuous peripheral arterial waveform was described toward the end of the nineteenth century (Mahomed, 1872; Roy, 1881; Guyton and Hall, 2000) and was expected to provide diagnostic information, physicians have paid little, if any, attention to the morphology of blood pressure waveform. This is likely due to the development of the auscultation method by Korotkov in 1905, which measures only the maximum (SBP) and minimum (DBP) values of the arterial pressure in brachial artery. It has advantages of being easy, reliable, non-invasive and cheap. The auscultation method assumes that the measured signal is quasi-stationary, which is only true if the subject is at rest and not perturbed during examination. SBP and DBP can be used to estimate a third hemodynamic parameter, the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is defined as the average arterial pressure during a cardiac cycle. MAP is computed from the normalized area below the continuous arterial pressure waveform. One approximation of MAP uses the following formula:
MAP = DBP + (SBP − DBP) 3.
This estimation utilizes SBP and DBP values and assumes that the arterial pressure waveform is the typical waveform of a young subject. The error (Michael, 1999) in using this formula is higher in older and very young subjects. Therefore, it is recommended that the MAP be computed from mathematical integration of the ABP waveform, whenever it is available. In 1970s, non-invasive devices for measuring continuous ABP appeared on the market. While invasive intra-arterial BP measurement

Arterial Blood Pressure Waveform Analysis and Its Applications

61

is considered to be more reliable and remains the gold standard, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring is recommended whenever the invasive technique is not justified. An example where invasive ABP monitoring is justified is in the intensive care unit, where indwelling arterial catheters are necessary for frequent drawing of arterial blood for blood gas monitoring and where it is useful to monitor ABP continuously so that sudden drops in ABP can be detected and acted upon immediately. In all other situations, invasive ABP measurement is best avoided because of the risk of complications such as thromboses, hematomas and infections. The main drawback of non-invasive monitors is that they need frequent calibration, which can lead to signal loss. Also, as with any indirect measurement, a scale factor needs to be computed to obtain the SBP, which is then used for calibration.

4.1.3  Variations in Waveform Morphology Depending on the Site of Recording
Depending on the site where the continuous blood pressure (CBP) signal is acquired, the waveform morphology varies (Bruner, 1979). Blood pressure waveforms vary between the aorta and locations further from the heart, such as brachial, radial and femoral arteries. The dicrotic notch, in particular, appears to be rather sensitive to the recording location. Figure 4.1 demonstrates the difference in morphology between the aortic and radial pressure waveforms. Portable tonometers allow blood pressure measurement at the carotid sinus, which is close to the aortic arch. However, since this instrument must be held manually, it is not practical in a study lasting more than several minutes. Radial ABP recording is much more common in practice. Hence, the algorithm that we present was developed mainly for radial pressure waveform, but minor changes can be made to analyze ABP signals recorded from other sites.

4.1.4  Morphological Analysis of ABP Waves and Arterial Stiffness Assessment
Recently, parameters obtained from blood pressure waveform analysis were found to be associated with cardiovascular risk in hypertension (Agabiti-Rosei et al., 2007) and other cardiac pathologies, such as orthostatic intolerance, diabetes and syncope (Romano et al., 2004; Simek et al., 2005; Laurent et al., 2006). It is known that arterial stiffness and wave reflections are responsible for increased systolic pressure. As the body ages, increased arterial stiffness leads to an increased velocity of the reflected wave across the artery (Roy, 1881).

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

Another important fact about arterial pressure is the so-called pressure wave amplification. Typically, diastolic and mean pressures change little across the arterial tree, but peak SBP increases as distance from the heart increases. An example of this is shown in Figure 4.1. The SBP in the aorta may be less than that in the brachial artery by more than 20 mmHg (Wilkinson et al., 2000) and the relationship between them is not always constant.
In addition, antihypertensive drugs may affect SBP differently at different sites. Despite similar reduction in brachial blood pressure, the reduction in pressure at the aorta may be different. The Windkessel model (Finkelstein and Cohn, 1992) and arterial wave propagation theory (O'Rourke and Avolio, 1980) have been used to model these phenomena extensively. The arterial pressure wave generated in the left ventricle, also known as the incident wave, travels through the arterial tree and when a bifurcation or another obstacle is found, a reflected wave is generated and propagated in the opposite direction. As a consequence, at any point in time, recorded pressure is the sum of incident and reflected waves. Both waves (incident and reflected) travel at the same velocity, known as pulse wave velocity (PWV). Large arteries are more sensitive to the loss of elasticity with age and this reduced elasticity is accompanied by an increased wave velocity. The aorta of a young subject can absorb almost all the energy from the contraction of the left ventricle, but the aorta of an older subject will reflect a large proportion of the waveform.
In the younger age group, the reflected wave appears during diastole, which promotes coronary perfusion. However, in older subjects, where increased PWV is expected, the reflected wave can appear during systole, resulting in increased systolic pressure.
The augmentation index (AI) is used to quantify the magnitude of the reflected wave and is defined as the pressure increment due to the reflected wave as a percentage of the PP. It can be measured at central (carotid) or distal (radial) sites, but due to differences in morphology, procedures are different. Despite the fact that the magnitude of the wave reflection depends not only on arterial stiffness but also on arterial tone, it is considered an indicator of arterial stiffness and is used as a risk predictor (Weber et al., 2004).
Another index related to PWV is the delay time (DT), which is the time elapsed between the peak of the incident wave and the peak of the reflected wave. A lower DT indicates a higher PWV and arterial stiffness.
The PWV along an arterial segment is calculated as the estimated length of the arterial segment divided by the foot-to-foot time of the arterial pressure at the beginning and end of the arterial segment in question. A typical arterial segment analyzed is between the carotid and femoral arteries, and the carotid–femoral PWV is considered to be the “gold standard” measurement of arterial stiffness (Laurent et al., 2006).
The carotid pressure waveform closely resembles the waveform recorded in the ascending aorta and is therefore believed to provide better information about cardiovascular risk (London et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2010). However, carotid measurements have some problems inherent to the method used. For example, sensors that are used to record the carotid pressure are handheld and are therefore susceptible to movement. Furthermore, since the position of sensor can shift, the waveform is prone to error due to a shift in the position (misalignment between the sensor and artery), and the recording duration is limited due to muscular fatigue experienced by the operator. On the other hand, pressure waveforms recorded at distal sites allow longer periods of measurement, since they are provided with elements to fix the sensor firmly in the right position. We note that reflection waves are present regardless of the site of measurement, allowing AI and DT to be computed with waveforms obtained at any site.
Computing central indices: In the case of central pressures, systolic peak can be detected from the first inflection point in the arterial pressure waveform (at height PP–ΔP in

Aortic blood pressure

FIGURE 4.2 One cardiac cycle from a typical aortic blood pressure trace. Aortic AI is computed as ΔP/PP.
Figure 4.2). This location marks the beginning of the upstroke of the reflected wave. The maximum of the waveform that corresponds to the SBP (PP in Figure 4.2) includes contribution from the reflected wave peak. The inflection point after the systolic pressure peak corresponds to the dicrotic notch. To compute the PP, the DBP that corresponds to the nadir of the waveform must be known.
Computing distal indices: The phenomenon of reflected pressure wave is present at all sites, including distal sites such as the radial, brachial and femoral locations, as described earlier. However, distances that the pressure wave has to travel are different, as is the corresponding time taken by the reflected wave to arrive and join the incident wave. In this case, the reflected wave can only appear after the systolic pressure peak and is located at the first inflection point found after the peak (at height P2 in Figure 4.3).
As has been stated, the central blood pressure contributes useful information towards the assessment of cardiovascular diseases. The AI can be obtained either by registering pressure waveforms at the carotid artery or by using mathematical methods to estimate central values from radial pressure records. The aortic waveform is then reconstructed by means of a generalized transfer function (Karamanoglu et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1997; Sharman et al., 2006). There is also a medical device that has incorporated this algorithm in its hardware (SphygmoCor from Atcor Medical, Itasca, IL, USA).
However, recent studies have demonstrated that radial AI is strongly and positively correlated with carotid AI in medicated hypertensive patients as well as in healthy controls (Millasseau et al., 2003; Sugawara et al., 2008). These results suggest that radial AI may provide information similar to that obtained using carotid AI.

4.2  Multi-Resolution Analysis
In the past, methods based on time–frequency analysis have been used for processing various biomedical signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and others. In particular, multi-resolution analysis (MRA) algorithms based on wavelet theory (Daubechies, 1992) allow a simultaneous localization in time and frequency, helping to characterize the shape of different parts of a complex signal.
MRA (Daubechies, 1992; Unser et al., 1993; Unser, 1996) is defined as a sequence of nested subspaces {Vj, j ∈ ℤ} such that Vj+1 ⊂ Vj and a scaling function ϕ such that the family {ϕj,k, k ∈ ℤ} is a basis for Vj, where
( ) ( ) φj,k t = 2− j/2 φ 2− jt − k
and ℤ is the set of integer numbers. If we denote Wj as the complement subspace of Vj with respect to Vj−1, the wavelet function
ψ defines the family of functions {ψj,k, k ∈ ℤ}; this set is a basis for Wj, where
( ) ( ) ψ j,k t = 2− j/2 ψ 2− jt − k .
Every signal sj ∈ Vj has a unique decomposition
sj = rj+1 + sj+1, with rj+1 ∈Wj+1 and sj+1 ∈Vj+1,
where rj+1 is the j + 1 residual. Repeating this process, it is possible to decompose a signal as a sum of signals at different resolution levels. In this way, different types of events, such as R-waves in ECG (Tanaka and Hargens, 1994), spikes and waves in EEG (D'Attellis et al., 1997), interictal epileptiform activity (Sirne et al., 1999) and epileptic seizures (Gigola et al., 2004), can be detected. In each case, the MRA is the basic tool, but a specific application requires the use of selected wavelet coefficients from different multi-resolution levels, which may be combined with appropriate thresholds in order to separate different types of features present in a signal.
Such analysis is an interesting and general tool that has been applied to different problems in biomedical engineering (Akay, 1997), electrical engineering, radar application and other fields. However, adaptation of a general method to a particular problem requires more calculations in the algorithm than those needed for multi-resolution. Thus, by and large, false positives and negatives may show up (D'Attellis and Fernandez-Berdaguer, 1997).
If s0(t) is the signal, the decomposition is
s0 = r1 + + rJ + sJ,

signal can be detected in r1, r2 and r3 levels, but this fact complicates the design of the detection algorithm. One must consider whether to use a general tool and adapt it for the specific application or develop a specific algorithm.
Problems arising from the use of wavelet transformations are mentioned next. ABP signals, such as those in Figure 4.7, have special characteristics that make the use of generalized wavelet algorithms difficult.
Consequently, we developed the algorithm described in the next section, for this application (Perfetto et al., 2009).
4.3  Requirements of an Algorithm to Analyze the Blood Pressure Waveform
In the previous section, we stated that arterial stiffness was the main variable that controls wave reflections and waveform morphology and that arterial stiffness can be assessed by measuring magnitudes of incident and reflected waves and the delay of the reflected wave. The requirements for the algorithm to compute AI and other indices are not very demanding, because, in general, with the patient at rest, only a few beats are needed to obtain a steadystate signal. All beats are averaged and then characteristic points are extracted from the averaged waveform of arterial pressure. In some cases, it can be done by manual inspection.
With the availability of A/D converters combined with computational tools with large storage capacity, continuous monitoring of blood pressure is now feasible. In combination with advanced algorithms, one can detect the characteristic points from the ABP waveforms, even in non-stationary environments.
4.3.1  Characterization of the Radial Arterial Pressure Waveform
Consider the following three segments of the pressure waveform:
1. Rising phase: It corresponds to the rise due to ventricular contraction following the opening of the atrioventricular valve. Mathematically, it can be represented as an increasing monotonic function. The maximum pressure is known as systolic pressure.

68

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

2. Dicrotic notch and reflected waves: Due to reflections in the arterial tree, we can have one or more local maxima. Reflected waves can also mask dicrotic notch. These factors may result in more than one maximum or none at all. For this reason, we decided not to use any features from this zone.
3. Final relaxation: The final part of the waveform corresponds to relaxation of ventricles, which, mathematically, can be viewed as a monotonic decay.
4.3.2  Determination of Invariant Feature Detectors
Blood pressure magnitude and heart rate vary beat-to-beat and in addition, one can expect periods of asystole. They could lead to difficulties in designing algorithms suitable for evaluating syncope. However, there are certain characteristics of a pressure waveform that are invariant. All arterial pressure waveforms have a rising phase and a decaying phase, with a dicrotic notch in between, in addition to one or more reflected waves. The algorithm checks the first and the third zone and finds the maximum associated with the first zone. The second zone, the duration of which is specified in the program and which contains the dicrotic notch, is ignored. Only if all these conditions are fulfilled, the peak value is recognized as the SBP.

4.4  Algorithm Design
When the sampled signal is plotted as a function of time, each representative point appears in black against a white background, thus offering a binary image. The y-axis represents pressure and the horizontal axis represents the time (sample number). The contour follower (Jain, 1989) is employed for linking points that fulfill one or more conditions.
4.4.1  Contour Follower
With this tool, we can identify signal segments associated with different portions of the pressure record (Figure 4.8). Starting at any point of the signal, rising or falling phase segments are identified. Each segment is formed by a group of points. To be recognized as belonging to the first group, each point is compared with its neighbor ahead. If the y-coordinate is bigger than that of the previous point, the point is accepted. In this case, a counter denoted as Up Counter (UC), increases its count in one unit, and the point is added to the segment. The value of the counter is associated with the time when the blood pressure increases, as part of the rising phase.
A point without increment can be tolerated due to digitization errors and it does not increment the counter. In the end, traces grow in size. Some will grow until the counter reaches a predetermined threshold level, min1.
However, in case a difference is negative and the counter does not reach the threshold level, not only the point but also the whole segment gets rejected. When such a limit is reached, a flag is set and the relative maxima are stored together with their corresponding occurrence time of and the segment will continue to grow until the maximum is found. The other segment, part of the diastolic runoff, must have reached the minimum min2 associated with a counter called Down Counter (DC2), in order for such a maximum to be accepted as a valid systolic pressure.

4.4.2  Invariant Property
The fact that the magnitude of the increment is not to be taken into account leads to an invariant property with respect to the magnitude of the signal. For example, if the algorithm is searching for the rising edge, it only compares current and successive values to verify that they are increasing. But the difference between them is not used. In this way, signals with different increasing rates are indistinguishable for the algorithm.

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

4.4.3  Filtering Noise and Correcting the Digitization Error
There are two sources of error: the first being due to the noise in signal acquisition and the second due to finite number of pixels in a sampled data segment. The proposed algorithm is very sensitive to noise, requiring application of a smoothing zero-phase FIR filter of the order 100 with a cutoff frequency of 30 Hz, to the pressure waveform. The second error occurring due to finite number of pixels cannot be corrected readily and has to be compensated subsequently.
4.4.4  Flowchart
The algorithm uses a sliding time window to search for and identify the characteristic parts of the blood pressure signal. To do this task, it uses a contour follower. The right part of the flowchart (Figure 4.8) checks for the presence of the rising edge and the left part checks for the subsequent falling edge. The center loop allows continued searching for the rising edge when no increment is found and is included to consider the digitization error. Finally, the lower part of the flowchart prevents the algorithm from entering an infinite loop when no blood pressure signal is detected; for example, during calibration or during prolonged asystole. It seldom occurs during positive tilt tests.
The following criteria are used by the algorithm:
1. The time window must be wide enough to include at least one cardiac cycle. 2. The contour is followed while the blood pressure rises, and the relative maximum has
to be stored until it identifies a peak, which must exceed a threshold (defined as min1). 3. It accepts a maximum as systole when both counters in Figure 4.8 (UC and DC)
reach pre-determined levels (min1 and min2) in the appropriate sequence. 4. When aforementioned conditions are fulfilled, the location and magnitude values
are stored. 5. To avoid the reflected wave region, when the peak is found, the time window is
shifted (delta2 in Figure 4.8), and the algorithm proceeds from that new position. 6. If the entire window is unsuccessfully explored, it is shifted again (delta1 in Figure
4.8), proceeding thereafter as before. 7. The whole process is repeated until there is success and/or until all data are
exhausted.
Diastolic values are detected by exploring the blood pressure trace in the reverse order, starting at each systole and storing the first minimum, both in magnitude and location.
4.4.5  Choosing Parameters
The constants min1 and min2 are related to the elapsed time of the rising and falling edges, respectively, and their values depend on the sampling rate. If they are set too high, there can be failure in the detection of some systoles; if they are set too low, false positives are likely to occur. Threshold1 and Threshold2 are set at 10 and 20 ms, respectively, which are not modified during signal processing.
The constant delta1 corresponds to the period where wave reflections are expected and is set at 10 ms. Similarly, delta2 is set according to the minimum interval between pulses expected in human tachycardia. It is set at 15 ms in our laboratory.

4.5  Results
Signals recorded during tilt test are processed offline. The time point at which the algorithm starts the computation is identified by the user, and it is best not to use the maximum value of the signal for this purpose. The algorithm presented herein is used for the calculation of beat-to-beat values of SBP and DBP. Figure 4.7 shows an example of the time points identified by the computer as locations of the peak systolic and diastolic pressure values for an 8 s stretch. Pressure values obtained in this manner are plotted against the beat number (X-axis), as shown in Figure 4.9 for a 5 min interval. The results obtained from our algorithms were verified by an independent researcher.

4.6  Application: Vasovagal Syncope Assessment
Tilt table testing (Kenny et al., 1986) is a tool used to reproduce syncope or pre-syncope in controlled conditions with continuous monitoring of cardiac parameters. In particular, an ECG channel and continuous radial ABP are commonly recorded. In the first part of the study, the subjects remain supine for 20 min to adjust to the laboratory environment, and baseline values of the hemodynamic variables are subsequently recorded over the next

72

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

5 min. Then the table is tilted up to 70° to evaluate the patient’s susceptibility to a syncope episode or for a duration determined by the researcher, usually lasting 45 min.
4.6.1  Signal Processing
The blood pressure measurements were determined using a non-invasive monitor (Colin Medical Instruments, San Antonio, TX, USA) that uses the tonometer technique associated with a cuff for calibration purpose. The ECG is recorded using a precordial lead.
ECG signals and blood pressure are digitized at 1200 samples/s, with a resolution of 12 bits, and stored in digital format on a PC. The continuous ABP was obtained by means of an NIBP monitor from Colin Medical Instruments. The waveforms were digitized and processed to extract the characteristic points, namely, SBP, DBP and the peak of the reflected wave. For each of these points, the corresponding magnitude and time stamp were recorded.
For this task, the proposed algorithm was used. It was modified to include the last characteristic point. After processing the CBP signal, values for each characteristic point are made available to the researcher.
4.6.2  Variability of AI and DT during Head-Up Test
Recently, the indices AI and DT, frequently used as early markers of increased arterial stiffness, have also been proposed to be useful as markers for discriminating subjects susceptible to vasovagal syncope (VVS) from healthy controls.
According to Chen et al. (2000), AI measurement at baseline of patients with VVS could confirm the diagnosis, making the tilt test, which thus far is the only recognized test for that purpose, sometimes unnecessary.
Simek et al. (2005) suggested that DT (time delay between systolic and diastolic peaks) could be used in the diagnosis of VVS even when recorded at supine rest.
In both papers, pressure waveforms are synchronously averaged, from which both values (AI and DT) are calculated. In our proposed approach, we first obtain these parameters for each cardiac cycle and then compute the mean for each series.
4.6.3  Study Population
Nineteen patients (10 males, 9 females; age: 22.21 ± 5.2) with a history of recurrent syncope but without a history of heart disease and a control group (5 males, 5 females; age: 22.6 ± 4.04) were evaluated. All underwent the tilt table test. Patients with syncope were classified either as positive responders (Group +) and others were negative responders (Group −), as shown in Table 4.2.
4.6.4  Results Observed from Variability of AI and DT
The results shown in Table 4.2 were obtained from studies conducted in our laboratory. In Figure 4.10, both indices are plotted as a function of the beat number. They show a behavior far from stationary, demonstrating that our approach is more suitable than computing these values from a single averaged signal.

4.7  Discussion
Conventional algorithms for detecting SBP and DBP from CBP signals usually rely on statistical properties (Zong et al., 2003; Treo et al., 2005). These algorithms were developed under the assumption of quasi-stationarity of the signal under consideration. The proposed method is designed to be applied to tilt table test studies. The methodology described herein enables us to examine offline records for checking visually whether the algorithm accurately accomplishes detection of systole or diastole. As stated earlier, accuracy of the blood pressure values relies on precise detection along the time axis.
The hypothesis that we could discriminate between patients with VVS and normal subjects based solely on these values, and without the need for a tilt table test, could not be proved, because values of both parameters in all population groups were not significantly different. We found no significant differences between various groups. However, for orthostatic position, there was a tendency toward lower values of DT (p = .08) in the

74

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

control population, compared to other groups. This score was achieved using orthogonal contrasts technique to increase the sensitivity of the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Our results suggest that the magnitude and timing of the reflected wave in the arterial tree of patients with a history of syncope may be different from those of normal group, and it occurs during tilt table test. A larger sample size may be needed to confirm our results.

4.8  Conclusions
The algorithm described in this chapter allows accurate detection of SBP and DBP from a continuous pressure curve. It can be used with non-stationary signals, because it does not rely on the history of the signal but takes advantage of known features within the signal. Low computational cost is an additional feature of the algorithm. We have demonstrated that variability of AI and DT can also be computed. Furthermore, our study suggests that the algorithm can be extended to other cardiac parameters, such as pulse photoplethysmography or arterial diameter measurements. It also opens the possibility of studying spontaneous changes in cardiac dynamics without external intervention.

5.1  Introduction Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a phenomenon discovered during the mid- to late 1990s by Georg Schmidt’s group in Munich (Schmidt et al., 1999). Their study of sinus rhythm following ventricular premature beats (often abbreviated as VPC, where C stands for complex or contraction) using signal averaging techniques historically applied to the study of electrocardiographic late potentials revealed that after a single arrhythmic ventricular beat, the heart rate increased* and then decreased before returning to baseline. Clinical research revealed that patients in whom this fluctuation of sinus rhythm was absent had a higher likelihood of dying (Schmidt et al., 1999).
Since its initial publication, many large-scale studies with thousands of patients have confirmed the utility of HRT in predicting mortality, cardiac mortality and, in some studies, arrhythmic mortality (Ghuran et al., 2002; Barthel et al., 2003; Hallstrom et al., 2005; Exner et al., 2007; Mäkikallio et al., 2005). Broadly speaking, its predictive capabilities rank with, or often exceed, that of conventional linear heart rate variability (HRV) measures. In 2008, the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology (ISHNE) published a consensus statement on the standards of measurement, mechanism and clinical applications (Bauer et al., 2008). The document provides a concise review of major HRTrelated studies. For the purposes of this book, I would like to focus on what is most likely to be salient to its audience, that is, those who may consider applying HRT to non-cardiac medical disciplines in much the same way as they have applied HRV in their respective fields. The topics covered in this chapter are measurement technique, mechanism and advantages and disadvantages of HRT over HRV.

Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications

5.2  Measurement Technique
We know from spectral analysis that human heart rate over the day is influenced by myriad intrinsic oscillations. In addition, human heart rate is influenced by non-periodic event-related changes, such as change in posture or activity or mental state (Roach et al., 1999). Many routine events such as eating, sleeping and physical exercise trigger many different autonomic reflexes. Therefore, a plot of RR interval (time from peak of one QRS complex to the next on electrocardiogram [ECG]) against time in a healthy subject has a jagged stochastic appearance. However, if a plot of RR interval against beat number (called a tachogram) is averaged over many cycles aligned to an abrupt event, the stochastic and multiple cyclic events cancel out and reveal a pattern that is solely related to the event. Computation of HRT uses the VPC as the fiduciary or anchor point, while the newer measure of phase-rectified signal analysis (Bauer et al., 2009), discussed in the next chapter, uses each instance of RR lengthening as the anchor (Figure 5.1). Averaging of the VPC-anchored tachograms is done over all valid VPC tachograms found in a 24 h Holter record.
The VPC tachogram sequence should include two sinus rhythm RR intervals before the VPC, the coupling interval and compensatory pause and 15 subsequent sinus RR intervals. If a tachogram is contaminated by any ectopic beats, it is excluded from the averaging process. Interpolated VPCs (VPCs that are not followed by a compensatory pause) are also excluded. HRT is quantified by two parameters termed turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) that correspond to the early acceleration and late deceleration of heart rate after the VPC. TO and TS are both calculated from the final averaged VPC tachogram. In other words, it is important not to calculate multiple TO and

TS values from individual tachograms and then average them. First, the tachograms are averaged to get one overall tachogram and then the TO and TS are calculated from that single tachogram.
TO is calculated using the following equation:

TO

=

(RR1

+

RR2 ) − (RR−2 + (RR−2 + RR−1)

RR −1 )

× 100,

where RR−2 and RR−1 are the two RR intervals immediately preceding the coupling interval of the VPC and RR1 and RR2 are the two RR intervals immediately following the compensatory pause (Figure 5.2). TO is a unitless ratio. A negative TO is considered normal. In other words, any acceleration of the heart rate in the two beats after the VPC and compensatory pause is a sign of good autonomic health. The second HRT parameter TS is defined as the maximum slope (>0) of a regression line assessed over all sequences of 5 consecutive RR intervals within the first 15 RR intervals after the VPC (Figure 5.2). TS ≥ 2.5 ms/beat is considered normal. In other words, a rapid slowing of heart rate after the initial acceleration is a sign of good autonomic health.
In risk stratification studies, HRT values have been used to classify patients into three categories, category 0: both TO and TS normal; category 1: either TO or TS abnormal; and category 2: both TO and TS abnormal. If HRT could not be calculated because there is no suitable VPC tachogram found in the recording, patients are sometimes classified as belonging to HRT category 0 (Tuomainen et al., 2005).
Various filters are used to select valid VPC tachograms. A VPC with long coupling interval (time from last sinus beat to the VPC) is expected to cause less of a drop in blood pressure, so a VPC appearing more than 80% of the way through the next expected RR interval value (mean of the five last sinus rhythm intervals preceding the VPC) is excluded. Likewise, compensatory pause should be >120% of the expected value. This criterion excludes interpolated VPCs. VPC tachograms with short (<300 ms), long (>2000 ms) or

FIGURE 5.2 A visual representation of how the heart rate turbulence parameters turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) are calculated. TO is the ratio of the change in the RR intervals from the average of the two beats before the VPC (baseline RR) to the average of the two beats after the compensatory pause, to the baseline RR (ΔRR/baseline RR). If heart rate accelerates after the VPC, the RR interval diminishes relative to the baseline and produces a negative TO. TS is the slope of the steepest regression line fitted over the sequences of five consecutive sinus rhythm RR intervals within the 15 RR intervals after the VPC. Three out of the eleven regression lines considered are shown. The regression line slope was 2.4 for the 1st through 5th RR intervals after the compensatory pause RR interval, 28.5 for the 4th through 8th and −1.0 for the 9th through 13th. The steepest slope was for the middle one. Therefore, the TS value for this particular average of 17 tachograms (same as in upper panel of Figure 5.1) would be 28.5 ms/beat.

highly variable (>200 ms beat-to-beat RR interval difference, or difference >20% from the five preceding sinus RR intervals) RR intervals should also be excluded. TO and TS are not significantly affected by the sampling frequency of the ECG signal until the sampling rate falls below 50 Hz (Bauer et al., 2008).
The number of VPCs averaged greatly affects the HRT values, as might be expected from the fact that averaging is what brings out the HRT phenomenon in relief (Figure 5.3). Low VPC counts tend to produce high TS values, since any large beat-to-beat increase in the RR interval produces a high slope by linear regression. TS calculation is blind to the correlation coefficient of the regression fit. If a slope for one sequence of five beats is greater than that of the other five-beat sequences in the averaged tachogram, it automatically becomes the TS value, regardless of fit. Fortunately, high TS is indicative of a healthy baroreflex, as is a low number of VPCs. Therefore, the spuriously high value of TS that may be obtained due to low VPC count in a 24 h record does not change the categorization of a patient. Indeed, in some epidemiological studies, patients showing lack of any VPCs on their Holter records have been lumped with normal HRT (both TS and TO normal, i.e., HRT category 0) (Tuomainen et al., 2005). The one caveat to this relaxed assumption is the occasional presence of patients with a large number of ectopic beats, ventricular or atrial, in whom valid VPC tachogram counts are low because few sequences of 15 clean (sinus) RR intervals are available and not because they have few VPCs. The percentage of Holter records in which HRT could not be measured because of atrial fibrillation or lack of VPCs has ranged from about 15% to 30% in the post–myocardial infarction population (Watanabe, 2003). The percentages have increased with time because advances in cardiac care for myocardial infarction patients have reduced extent of myocardial scarring and morbidity, and with it, the number of VPCs. Five is commonly mentioned as the minimum number of VPC tachograms that should be averaged. However, as discussed earlier, it has also been recommended that HRT be calculated even if there is only one VPC (Schneider et al., 2004).

FIGURE 5.3 A plot showing the dependence of turbulence slope (TS) values (ordinate) on the number of VPCs (abscissa) averaged. This plot shows the distribution of TS values from 163 patients who had at least 50 VPCs each in the ISAR database. For x = 1, only the first VPC in the 24 h Holter record was used to calculate TS in each patient, for x = 2, the first two PVCs were used and so on. The last box plot shows the distribution of TS values in these 163 patients when all PVCs were used for TS calculation. (From dissertation of Melanie Gehring, 2007, Technische Universität München.)

5.3  Autonomic Basis of HRT
At its core, HRT is a baroreflex measure. A VPC causes an instantaneous drop in the volume of blood ejected from the heart and, therefore, a transient drop in blood pressure. The drop in volume is caused by several factors, including electrical restitution characteristics (shorter contraction time due to insufficient recovery of myocyte ion channels), shorter time for diastolic filling, loss of atrial kick, higher afterload and asynchronous ventricular contraction. The systolic blood pressure produced by the compensatory pause beat has also been found to be lower than baseline (Wichterle et al., 2006). The drop in blood pressure caused by these two beats activates the baroreflex arc, leading to heart rate acceleration and sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. However, because the drop in blood pressure due to a VPC is transient, the compensatory mechanisms that increase the cardiac output and blood pressure kick in when the heart is back in sinus rhythm, producing a normal stroke volume and leading to a blood pressure overshoot. This, in turn, triggers slowing of heart rate. This interplay between blood pressure and heart rate can be seen by plotting the beat-to-beat blood pressure values and the VPC tachogram together (Davies et al., 2001; Roach et al., 2002, 2003; Wichterle et al., 2006). Blood pressure drops, then increases above baseline, peaking around the eighth post-VPC beat, before returning to baseline, with the RR intervals behaving similarly but with a delay. As might be expected, based on this mechanism, both TO and TS have been found to correlate highly with the baroreflex sensitivity assessed by the phenylephrine method (Iwasaki et al., 2005; La Rovere, 2011), as well as the α-index obtained from computing the cross-spectra between HRV and blood pressure variability (Davies et al., 2001). Davies et al. also found a high correlation between baroreflex sensitivity and the ratio of RR slope to systolic blood pressure slope.
Based on the time scale at which the HRT phenomenon unfolds and on the biochemistry of neurotransmitters and receptors, one presumes that the initial heart rate acceleration after the VPC is due to vagal withdrawal. The heart rate slowing in the later stage of HRT is likely due to the combined withdrawal of sympathetic activity and reinstatement of vagal activity. The surge of muscle sympathetic nerve activity recorded after the VPC has been found to begin not earlier than the first post-VPC beat (Lombardi et al., 1989; Welch et al., 1989). Consistent with such assumptions and observations, atropine, a muscarinic (vagal) receptor blocker, causes HRT to flatten, that is, both TS and TO tend toward 0 (Marine et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2002). β-Blockade (esmolol) has been found to have little effect on HRT (Lin et al., 2002), as might be expected from the fact that vasoconstriction is α-adrenergically, rather than β-adrenergically, mediated. Since the blood pressure profile is not affected, the vagus is still able to slow the heart rate after the blood pressure overshoots.
There is known to be a dependence of HRT on heart rate across individuals as well as within individuals (Watanabe, 2006; reviewed in Watanabe and Schmidt, 2004). The mechanisms responsible for this dependence are not completely understood but have led some to suggest correcting HRT for heart rate (Cygankiewicz et al., 2004).

5.4  Advantages of HRT
One of the most appealing aspects of HRT is its simplicity. There are not many adjustable parameters affecting its calculation, such as selection of window size and selection of

frequency limits. There is also little subjectivity involved, such as might arise during manual overreading of the Holter record to exclude segments of the record with artifact. These attributes mean that researchers from different institutions given the same RR interval record should come up with the same HRT values without the need for prior consultation with each other or use of the same software. HRT also has only two parameters, TS and TO, which, moreover, have clearly defined cutoff values between normal and abnormal, TS = 2.5 ms/beat and TO = 0. These cutoff values have been validated in large clinical studies. Lack of stationarity of the signal is not a cause for concern, since shifts in baseline cancel each other out during the averaging process. Finally, with respect to the large population of patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, HRT has been found to perform as well as, or somewhat better than, HRV in risk stratification. This advantage is usually apparent from multivariate analyses in which one or both HRT parameters are found to be independent, while conventional HRV parameters that are significant predictors in univariate analyses fail to show independence.

5.5  Limitations of HRT
As with HRV, HRT cannot be measured in patients with atrial fibrillation, which unfortunately is an increasingly common disorder in older people. A distinctive limitation of HRT is that its measurement requires the presence of multiple VPCs in the Holter record being analyzed. Since patients with cardiac disorders have frequent VPCs, HRT measurement is not a problem in this population, especially if patients with no VPCs are categorized as having normal HRT. However, studies whose aim is to achieve better understanding of the mechanism of HRT using healthy or young individuals or experimental animals are difficult to design and perform. It also makes it harder to use HRT to study the changes in the autonomic nervous system in patients who have non-cardiac disorders. This requirement also makes it difficult to measure HRT using short (<24 h) ECG records, or when trying to study circadian variability of HRT, that would require VPCs to be evenly distributed over the day so that HRT parameters can be compared from one time window to the next (Watanabe, 2007). One of the ways around this problem is to study what is called induced HRT (Watanabe et al., 2002), that is, HRT demonstrated by pacing the heart directly, for example, during invasive programed ventricular stimulation, or even via devices such as cardiac defibrillators (Marine et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2002; Roach et al., 2002).
However, in populations of patients who do have frequent VPCs, HRT measurements in short time periods can provide clinically interesting observations. HRT has been measured in short implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) records with only 1000 RR intervals (Watanabe, 2006). That particular study showed that the mean and the standard deviation of TS were reduced in imminent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, but only in patients who had normal HRT in the baseline ECG recorded at the time of ICD implantation. Patients with low HRT, to begin with, could not demonstrate such a reduction.
In another study of patients with frequent VPCs, the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea episodes and HRT parameters was studied (Watanabe et al., 2008). TS was found to correlate significantly with oxygen desaturation duration per apnea event in rapid eye movement (REM) stage sleep. Combined with the higher VPC frequency in REM sleep compared to the wake periods in patients with more severe apnea, it was concluded
