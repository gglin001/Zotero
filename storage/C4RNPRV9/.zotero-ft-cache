ABSTRACT
In this thesis, a novel graphene (GN) based electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor is designed, constructed and tested to validate the concept of coating GN, which is a highly electrically conductive material, on Ag substrates of conventional electrodes. The background theory, design, experiments and results for the proposed GN-based ECG sensor are also presented.
Due to the attractive electrical and physical characteristics of graphene, a new ECG sensor was investigated by coating GN onto itself. The main focus of this project was to examine the effect of GN on ECG monitoring and to compare its performance with conventional methods. A thorough investigation into GN synthesis on Ag substrate was conducted, which was accompanied by extensive simulation and experimentation. A GN-enabled ECG electrode was characterised by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy along with electrical resistivity and conductivity measurements. The results obtained from the GN characteristic experimentation on Raman spectroscopy, detected a 2D peak in the GN-coated electrode, which was not observed with the conventional Ag/AgCl electrode. SEM characterisation also revealed that a GN coating smooths the surface of the electrode and hence, improves the skin-to-electrode contact. Furthermore, a comparison regarding the electrical conductivity calculation was made between the proposed GNcoated electrodes and conventional Ag/AgCl ones. The resistance values obtained were 212.4 Ω and 28.3 Ω for bare and GN-coated electrodes, respectively. That indicates that the electrical conductivity of GN-based electrodes is superior and hence, it is concluded that skin-electrode contact impedance can be lowered by their usage. Additional COMSOL simulation was carried out to observe the effect of an electrical field and surface charge density using GN-coated and conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes on a simplified human skin model. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the addition of electrical field and surface charge capabilities and hence, coating GN on Ag substrates was validated through this simulation.
This novel ECG electrode was tested with various types of electrodes on ten different subjects in order to analyse the obtained ECG signals. The experimental results clearly showed that the proposed GN-based electrode exhibits the best performance in terms of ECG signal quality, detection of critical waves of ECG morphology (P-wave, QRS complex and T-wave), signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) with 27.0 dB and skin-electrode contact impedance (65.82 kΩ at 20 Hz) when compared to those obtained by conventional a Ag/AgCl electrode.
Moreover, this proposed GN-based ECG sensor was integrated with core body temperature (CBT) sensor in an ear-based device, which was designed and printed using 3D technology. Subsequently,

a finger clipped photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor was integrated with the two-sensors in an Arduino based data acquisition system, which was placed on the subject’s arm to enable a wearable multiple physiological measurement system. The physiological information of ECG and CBT was obtained from the ear of the subject, whilst the PPG signal was acquired from the finger. Furthermore, this multiple physiological signal was wirelessly transmitted to the smartphone to achieve continuous and real-time monitoring of physiological signals (ECG, CBT and PPG) on a dedicated app developed using the Java programming language. The proposed system has plenty of room for performance improvement and future development will make it adaptable, hence being more convenient for the users to implement other applications than at present.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1. Wireless Body Area Network for Personal Health Monitoring
The rapid growth of wireless technologies brings with it new innovative ideas that enable continuous real-time remote patient monitoring in healthcare services using compact wireless body sensors. The services and technologies provide relatively uncontroversial, well-communicated and monitoring devices, developed to give more affordable solutions. specifically for mobile healthcare, such as daily activity monitoring, personal healthcare and monitoring systems as well as body sensor systems that can alert clinicians via patients’ mobile phones. The new trend in remote patient monitoring is moving towards the use of personal mobile devices compatible with multiple biomedical sensors using wireless communication, such as Bluetooth and Zigbee [1].
Recent mobile health (m-health) technology is enabling the monitoring of people’s daily activity on their smartphones. In addition, these mobile-based portable embedded devices will be able to provide platforms to monitor their critical physiological data continuously and remotely. In order to accomplish this, advancing technology in sensors, low-power integrated systems, and wireless communication will need to be brought together to enable the design of low-cost, miniature, and smart physiological sensor nodes [2]. An assessment report was prepared for the European Union (EU) regarding the effectiveness of m-health in biomedical applications and the diagnosis of diseases in 2013. According to this report, m-health applications could save €99 billion in healthcare costs in the EU and add €93 billion to the EU GDP in 2017, if its adoption were embraced [3].
The integrated wearable monitoring systems, which aim to bring together compact body sensors, including such as electrocardiography (ECG), blood pressure, photoplethysmography (PPG), core body temperature (CBT), heart rate, pulse oximetry, and electroencephalogram (EEG). The wearable monitoring systems also aim to form the concept of a wireless body area or personal area network (WBAN or WPAN) using the intelligent nodes of body sensors, and displays the physiological vital signs on a monitoring device. One of the benefits that WBAN systems brings is the ability to integrate multiple smart sensors, wireless connectivity and a small battery into a wearable patch unit that sends the physiological data to a mobile device. Figure 1.1 illustrates the general concept of a typical WBAN, where the general tasks of the electronics designer are compactness, integration of body sensors and wireless communication in a specified telemedicine system, which can alert a clinician when life-threatening changes occur, or provide feedback to the patient to help maintain an optimal health status using Cloud health services.

ECG Monitoring System Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, killing more than 15 million people every year [4]. Continuous and real-time monitoring of heart activities with well-established medical test electrocardiography (ECG) is increasingly playing an important role in the early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ECG waveform that reflects electrical activity of the heart is widely used for early detection and management of heart problems. Using the concept of wearable wireless monitoring, any critical change in the heart or health status of an individual can be identified by the patient his/herself or transmitted to a clinician for early diagnosis and further analysis regarding his/her status. Figure 1.2 shows an ECG monitoring system using the conventional method of three Ag/AgCl electrodes (wet adhesive electrodes) that are affixed to the chest and waist. The other methods of ECG monitoring systems and types of electrodes will be explained in depth in the next chapter.

Figure 1.2: The typical 3-lead ECG monitoring system [3] 1.3. CBT Monitoring System Core body temperature (CBT) is a significant parameter for long-term measurements of the human body’s efficiency in maintaining its conducting temperature within a stable range, generally between 36 °C and 37 °C. Continuously measuring the CBT for extended periods of time is useful for studying human thermoregulation in ambulatory settings and during exercise. In particular, in sports medicine, an accurate measurement of CBT throughout exercise can be beneficial for maintaining the body’s operating temperature and preventing heat injury problems, such as hypothermia, hyperthermia, and heat stroke. Specifically, decreasing body temperature can lead to hypothermia, whereas rising core body temperature is a sign of impending heat illness, starting with heat stress (beyond 37 °C), advancing to hyperthermia, and heat exhaustion (beyond 39 °C), and then, to heat stroke (beyond 40 °C) [5]. Heat illnesses, in combination with such as climate change, overdressing or overacting may lead to a deterioration in physical performance and a rising risk of heat stroke consequences [6]. Consequently, early detection of a critical temperature (beyond 37 °C), especially after prolonged exercise, is a crucial way of preventing heat injuries. CBT is monitored continuously in recent technology using wearable wireless communication with body sensors. In the literature chapter, recent studies on such matters will be reviewed in detail. Figure 1.3 illustrates one such method of CBT that is measured by an ear thermometer.

Figure 1.3: Ear-tympanic device to measure core body temperature [3] 1.4. PPG Monitoring System Common diseases, such as pneumonia and diarrhea are taking the lives of millions of young people every year [7], mostly due to the onset and growth of an inflammatory disease of the body, termed sepsis. This inhibits the lungs transporting oxygen molecules to the haemoglobin in the blood, which is a vital operation for the functioning of the cells throughout the body. A short term disorder in producing or transfer enough oxygen to the blood will damage the cellular function and this will affect badly the function of the cellular movement or the tissues, often leading to death [8]. Consequently, the early detection of decreased oxygen levels in the blood is essential for identifying anybody requiring diagnosis to see whether he/she has this specific disease. The common method of measuring arterial oxygen level in the blood is pulse oximetry, which refers to using optical sensing technology. Photopletysmography (PPG) is a technique for measuring the change in light absorption by the skin by an optical method involving pulse waves to ascertain the rate of blood flow [9]. That is, by using PPG technology, the output of the photo-detector will show whether the signals are moving in accordance with every heartbeat and thus, the heart rate or pulse rate will also be provided from those signals. Figure 1.4 shows a typical reflective PPG sensor, which measures both blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the heart rate.

1.5. Aims of this Thesis
The main aim of this project is to investigate the effect of different types of electrodes for ECG monitoring and to develop an ECG sensor with a view to providing a consistent method for producing high quality, electrically conductive graphene (GN) films that can be integrated onto ECG electrodes, thereby improving ECG results. It has been shown the the growth of GN on an Ag/AgCl electrode provides better electrical properties than that of the traditional adhesive Ag/AgCl electrode. Another aim of this work is to integrate multiple body sensors including an electrocardiogram (ECG), core body temperature (CBT), and photoplethysmography (PPG) into a miniaturised device. This device wirelessly transmits physiological data to a smartphone to visualise them on. A smartphone application is written in Java to display these ECG, CBT, heart rate and SpO2 data wirelessly. A wide of variety wearable body sensors have already been implemented for continuously and wirelessly monitoring healthcare data. In order to design an optimised smart sensor system, several available wearable monitoring systems have been reviewed (see literature review presented in Chapter 2). Another objective of this research is to implement a smart body sensor system in an innovative ear bud designed to collect ECG and CBT data from the ear. This means that two physiological data can be collected with an unobtrusive method using ear bud technology within the proposed design.
In summary, the main objectives of this research are:
 To develop a novel graphene (GN) based ECG electrode with improved electrical properties and able to provide more information about the heart;
 To investigate the electrical characteristics of GN-based ECG electrodes;  To integrate GN-based ECG electrodes with other body sensors (CBT and PPG) to perform a
multiple smart sensor system in healthcare applications;  To send these physiological data wirelessly to a smartphone that displays continuously collected
data including ECG, CBT, heart rate and SpO2 in a written application;  To design a novel method to sense ECG and CBT data within an ear bud system that sends the
integrated data to the hardware acquisition system;  To obtain ECG and CBT measurements from the ear with the designed ear bud device;  To show demonstrate the superiority of the experimental results for ECG monitoring when
comparing the traditional adhesive Ag/AgCl and the newly developed GN-based ECG electrodes.

Chapter 4 focuses on graphene (GN) technology and the methods regarding how GN is produced for biosensing applications. After giving some examples using GN in an electronic device, the details of the fabrication process are presented regarding GN growth implementation on an Ag/AgCl electrode substrate. Furthermore, the Raman microscopy of graphene is described to show the significant parameters of GN-grown electrode using a confocal Raman spectrometer. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of GN-coated electrode are taken after several experimental studies. Finally, the electrical properties of the proposed GN-coated electrodes have been analysed.

2.1 Review of developed different types of electrodes for ECG monitoring
The electrode is the main component affecting the quality of measured ECG signals. In terms of developing ECG electrodes, various applications proposed by a number of researchers using different types of materials. Traditionally, clinical ECG recorders commonly use the adhesive Ag/AgCl electrodes, which require conductive gels and skin preparation to lower the skin-electrode contact impedance. Nevertheless, various kinds of electrode developments, such as metal electrodes, textile electrodes, carbon nanotube based electrodes, dry electrodes which can measure bio-potentials without applying any conductive gels or skin preparation, have been proposed for miniaturized ECG acquisition systems. Puurtinen et al [10] proposed dry textile electrodes to show how the electrode size and preparation of the electrode (dry electrode - wet Ag/AgCl electrode – textile electrode) affect the measurement noise, and the skin-electrode contact impedance. Dry textile electrodes moistened with water, and then textile electrodes covered by hydrogel were studied with five different sizes. The experimental results demonstrated that noise level increases as the electrode size decreases. The noise level was high in dry textile electrodes (75 dB), comparing to wet electrodes (Ag/AgCl), which had quite low noise (55 dB) similar to that of textile electrodes covered by hydrogel (51 dB). Gruetzmann et al [11] presented the development, fabrication and characterization of two novel dry electrodes for ECG monitoring. Four different types of electrodes (wet Ag/AgCl electrodes – dry Ag/AgCl electrodes – skin adaptive electrode – capacitive electrode) were prepared for the experimental work. Furthermore, a passive filter algorithm was integrated into the new electrodes to suppress fluctuation of the ECG signal caused by motions due to breathing or body movements. Compared to wet Ag/AgCl electrodes, the novel dry electrodes (adaptive and capacitive) indicated a higher contact impedance but acceptable ECG signals.
Another flexible dry electrode was developed for the long term monitoring of ECG by Baek et al [12] by using elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is known to be inexpensive, biocompatible and amenable to micro-molding. A mixture metallic layer (Au and Ti layers) was

30 patterned on a thin PDMS substrate and they produced a PDMS-based surface electrode for the long-term measurement of ECG signals. The group fabricated a forearm-wearable electrode by connecting the Velcro to the PDMS electrode which is shown in Figure 2.1a. The skin-electrode contact impedances were measured of proposed electrode and wet Ag/AgCl electrode. Regarding the experimental results, although the contact impedance of PDMS-based electrode was higher than Ag/AgCl electrodes, measured ECG signals of PDMS electrodes showed comparatively good fidelity, which is shown in Figure 2.1b. Furthermore, proposed PDMS electrodes exhibited that has no negative influence on the skin, even applying after one week of continuous wear.

electrode and from the Ag/AgCl electrode [12] Leonhardt and Aleksandrowicz [13] have studied a sensing technique suitable for non-contact ECG monitoring inside a car, when the engine was running, and car was stationary and moving. As a non-contact measurement is desirable for long-term ECG acquisition, capacitive ECG electrodes were implemented for an automotive application. Figure 2.2a shows the co-driver’s seat featuring two capacitive electrodes in the backrest, and an additional acceleration sensor in the seat. In addition, a driven-right-leg circuit was used to reduce common mode effects by negative feedback

31 with an additional reference electrode. Figure 2.2b indicates the results of ECG signals during different scenarios: engine switched off, engine running idle, and car in driving mode. During all trials, driver was wearing normal cotton shirts with a thickness of 0.3 mm. According to the results, the P-wave of all cases were detected, however, the resulting body movements on the seat caused fluctuations on the ECG signal, as can be seen in (b).

Yoo et al [4] proposed a wearable ECG monitoring system with planar-fashionable circuit board (PFCB) based shirt. Dry electrodes were fabricated and used for long-term monitoring of proposed ECG system to avoid use of wet electrodes due to toxicological concerns of electrolyte gels. The results revealed that the monitoring system was capturing the ECG signal successfully when both wet Ag/AgCl and P-FCB dry electrodes attached to the chest. The P-FCB electrode indicated a little more distortion, since this type of dry electrode had larger contact impedance than that of the wet Ag/AgCl electrode. However, the captured ECG waveform with the P-FCB dry electrode showed good information that included all signs of ECG waveform (P, QRS and T). Fuhrhop et al [14] implemented a textile integrated capacitively coupled electrodes (CCE) based ECG monitoring system for a long-term application. This system comprises of a convenient textile, active capacitive electrodes, and low power acquisition unit with a Bluetooth module. Two capacitive electrodes have been developed and placed on the textile and one reference electrode was used for driving right leg circuit method to reduce power line interference. ECG measurements were taken in both sitting and walking positions. Even though the capacitively coupled electrodes exhibited sufficient ECG signals for sitting position, a distorted signal was observed during walking that needs to be improved. Wang et al [15] developed a wearable mobile ECG monitoring system using a novel dry foam electrode. The proposed wearable mobile ECG monitoring system of this group consists of a wearable ECG acquisition device, a mobile phone with Global Positioning System (GPS), and a healthcare server. The wearable ECG acquisition device in this system contains three proposed dry foam electrodes. Researchers designed these dry foam electrodes to monitor ECG signals for longterm application and comfortably used in daily life for the patients. This wearable ECG device, which is small in size (4 cm x 2.5 cm x 0.6 cm), wireless and low power consumption (long-term ECG monitoring over 33 hours), has been tested for patients suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF) in China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. For 25 AF patients, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the proposed system were 94.56 % and 99.22 % respectively. Figure 2.3 shows top view (a) and exploded view (b) of the proposed dry foam ECG electrode and gives an overview of the whole wearable ECG acquisition system (c). Regarding the performance of this proposed electrode, the impedance variation was investigated under different frequency ranges and the impedance of proposed dry electrodes was similar to that of the conventional wet electrode. The impedance variation of the proposed dry foam electrode was observed in the range from 14 to 24 k, and is in the acceptable range for a typical ECG measurement.

Figure 2.3: (a) Top view; (b) Exploded view of the proposed dry foam ECG electrode, which was covered by the conductive fabric and then paste on an Au layer; (c) An overview of the whole proposed ECG monitoring system within a wearable medical vest [15] Gandhi et al [16] presented a theory and characterization of several different types of electrodes that contained dry and non-contact electrodes, including PCB solder finish, latex, cotton, silver cloth and soldermask. The noise spectra of the electrodes were measured on a subject to analyse the effects of biological or chemical noise that is triggered by skin-electrode contact impedance. In order to do that, two electrodes are mounted on the forearm to record the baseline noise for different types of dry and non-contact electrodes while a third electrode was used to ground the instrumentation. ECG measurements were also studied to see the performances of each type of electrode and compared to the signal from a wet Ag/AgCl electrode. Results demonstrated that the type of electrode which was made using lead-free PCP solder finish, can function as a general purpose, low-noise dry electrode. Latex and soldermask types can work as insulated electrodes. Rashkovska [17] et al developed a telemedicine application that provides a comfortable option for monitoring of the heart activity on the mobile phone using wireless bipolar body electrode in realtime. For displaying wirelessly recorded ECG data on a smartphone, wireless bipolar body electrodes were used. In order to transmit the ECG data wirelessly, a wireless transmission protocol

34 called SimpliciTI was used for converting the packets to an appropriate Bluetooth protocol. Additionally, they also showed that the standard 12-lead ECG can be reconstructed and displayed using these type wireless electrodes. Fong and Chung [18] proposed a healthcare monitoring system based on mobile phones and noncontact electrodes. A subject wearing a cotton shirt sits on a chair with conductive non-contact electrodes are attached on the seat, which has also other electronic equipment including battery supply, transmitter and Bluetooth module. ECG signals are acquired from the subject through the cotton shirt and filtered by an electronic circuit module. After retrieving ECG signal from the sensory module, users can see the ECG signal on their mobile phones via Bluetooth module. Figure 2.4 shows the setup of ECG real-time monitoring system (a) and also the comparisons of ECG signals obtained using adhesive Ag/AgCl and proposed non-contact electrode system (b). Additionally, a web page performance was developed to test latency monitoring and provide and efficient health tracking system by clinicians or doctors.

35 Yang et al [19] examined the performance of a contactless capacitive electrode for ECG measurement. Recordings and comparison is made regarding ECG measurement using both explored non-contact electrodes and conventional pre-gelled electrodes on a hairy chest, with the same bio-sensing circuits. As can be seen in Figure 2.5, the experimental results indicated that wet electrodes have difficulties during ECG measurements from a hairy chest. Using proposed noncontact electrodes, ECG signal can be acquired from a hairy chest as well as improving long term monitoring of ECG without use of gel or skin preparation.

Figure 2.5: (a) Hairy chest illustrates difficulties for acquiring ECG signals via gel Ag/AgCl electrodes; (b) Non-contact electrodes also show comparable ECG signals to that of Ag/AgCl electrodes without skin preparation. Both signals were obtained before filtering process [19] Likewise, another long-term monitoring of ECG is done for ubiquitous healthcare systems using dry textile electrodes by Oh et al [20]. They investigated the performance of proposed five different dry electrodes (two of five are different electrospun conductive nanofiber web electrodes; and the rest three are metal plated fabrics). The researchers have evaluated contact impedance, step response, noise signal performance indices for the proposed five dry electrodes, and also compared the results to those of traditional wet Ag/AgCl electrodes. Regarding the results, explored nanofiber web electrodes revealed the performance closely to that of Ag/AgCl electrode than other proposed metal plated fabric electrodes. Another observation from the experiments is that ECG waveforms from nanofiber web electrodes were better than for metal plated fabrics including lower noise

36
power spectral densities. Lin et al [21] developed novel non-contact electrodes for mobile ECG system based on ubiquitous computing. Proposed contactless electrodes can measure bio-potentials through clothing, allowing the electrode can be integrated on a patient’s normal clothing to record ECG data in daily life. Here, the proposed non-contact electrodes were utilized within a wearable wireless ECG acquisition module, which sends the ECG data through mobile phone to monitor realtime continuously. The group has also tested the implemented non-contact electrodes for monitoring the heart rate of six patients (between 40 and 70 ages) with heart arrhythmia under motion and action. Despite of the movements of the non-contact electrodes under motion and action resulted with noise, the key points of an ECG waveform was detected. Besides, using the QRS detection algorithm, heart rate can be calculated easily from the R waves. Furthermore, the experimental results revealed that both of the sensitivity and accuracy values for detecting arrhythmia seem efficient using the proposed non-contact electrodes.
Ito et al [22] examined the non-contact sensing of ECG signals of a human body on the bed in different positions. Six pieces conductive fabrics were used for the experiments. Three of them were used for ECG amplifying feature to have high impedance, and the rest three of them were used for reading capacitance meters. Capacitances for upper and lower bodies were separately measured. The non-contact electrodes were tested on a male subject who is instructed to sit down on a bed, lie on the bed in a supine position, and lie on lateral position to see the differences in the ECG signal. Results showed that ECG signal was detected in the periods when the subject was in supine or lateral position as can be seen in Figure 2.6. In addition, QRS complexes, P-waves, and T-waves were confirmed, although some distortions have been observed.
Varadan et al [23] developed a wearable wireless textile based nano-biosensor system for cardiac health monitoring, called as e-Nanoflex platform. This implementation was made of nano-biosensor with Bluetooth module for communication with smartphone to display bio-potentials simultaneously. As can be investigated in Figure 2.7a, the pair of nano-biosensor electrode pads, which was made of gold nanowire on flexible Titanium foil, was mounted on a wound dressing plaster to facilitate easy implementation for the patients. Lead I ECG signal obtained from the sensor in the frequency content between 0.2 and 70 Hz. The sampling rate was fixed at 200 Hz to conduct Nyquist sampling theorem. A comparison was also made using commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes and gold nanowire electrodes regarding three lead ECG signals as shown in Figure 2.7b and 2.7c. The signals from the both two type of electrodes were observed nearly similar. The ECG data from the e-Nanoflex sensor system can also be sent to a remote server via 3G network within the current GPS location and time. In case of emergency, a message with recorded information can also be sent to emergency team to monitor remotely.

Co-authors of this group also implemented two textile platforms that monitors ECG, PPG, blood pressure using e-Nanoflex sensory system from a t-shirt and a bra, and display multi body potentials on the smartphone wirelessly, called e-vest, and e-bra respectively [24,25]. The e-vest platform is development of a multi-parameter wearable wireless textile-based nano-biosensor that records ECG and blood pressure. As can be seen in Figure 2.8a, e-vest textile platform was structured by three textile electrodes and connected to a sensor electronics module (SEM). A photoplethysmography (PPG) technique was used in forming armband that has infrared LEDs and photodiodes which were connected to the SEM through conductive traces. SEM of e-vest application consists of an amplifier, filter circuits, a microcontroller, and a ZigBee wireless radio to transmit multi-parameter signals to the mobile phone. Besides, Figure 2.8b illustrates e-bra system that incorporated in the inner garment for women using e-Nanoflex wireless sensor platform. The aim of this work was to wirelessly acquire ECG signals from subjects using e-bra system and perform heart rate variability analysis on a PC. They also successfully monitored ECG waveforms, heart rate and blood pressure values on a smartphone using R-R interval calculations from ECG.

In addition multichannel signal smartphone display consists of heart rate, and blood pressure [24-25] Hsu et al [26] proposed barbed microtip-based electrode arrays for monitoring ECG and EEG signals by using silicon wet etching. In order to form a standard pyramidal microtip array, KOH anisotropic wet etching was performed and HF/HNO3 was used to synthesize barbs on the microtips. Additionally, a through-silicon via (TSV) method was proposed to improve the electrical conductivity between the tip array and the electrode lead during the wet etching process. The impedances of the skin-electrode interface were compared using wet Ag/AgCl electrode and proposed barbed type dry electrodes. Furthermore, EEG and ECG recordings were demonstrated using both Ag/AgCl and barbed type dry electrodes. The experimental results indicated that the contact impedance of the barbed dry electrode was lower than was that of the wet Ag/AgCl electrode that also needs skin preparation. Regarding ECG recordings, both proposed barbed dry electrodes and conventional wet electrodes demonstrated similar waveforms. Kwon et al [27] developed a brassiere-based reliable ECG monitoring system, called CardioGuard, in supporting daily mobile healthcare (m-health) applications for women. The system comprises of two key

40 components: (1) a brassiere-based wearable sensor and (2) smartphone middleware for a daily ECG-based healthcare application. Figure 2.9 shows the prototype of the bra sensor and the sensor device. Gold-plated wire electrodes were used to acquire ECG signal in this application and the sensor device was placed at the cleavage so that the free space was utilized by structure and shape of the brassiere. They have observed the motion artifacts caused by daily activities (such as walking, riding or car driving) to see the robustness of the proposed system. Moreover, 2.9f shows the ECG signal using proposed CardioGuard system. Regarding the results of the system, QRS peaks were detected during 12 daily activities with different degrees of movement, such as resting, eating, desk working, lying supine, car driving, riding a bicycle or a bus, and with 10 participants. The average QRS peak detection ratio is 89.53% over all activities.

Batchelor and Casson [28] examined the performance of proposed inkjet printed electrodes for ECG monitoring in personalized healthcare. They manufactured two types of electrodes: (a) inkjet printed capacitive and (b) tattoo-style inkjet printed ECG electrodes (printed metal electrode on a very thin, around 10 m, layer of plastic) for long term biosignal monitoring. Regarding the performance comparison, three types of electrodes were tested on the subject to see recorded ECG signals as can be seen in Figure 2.10. This was followed by a test in which the subject walked around to investigate motion artifacts in the acquired traces. All recordings used a 10 bit resolution, 1024 Hz sampling rate, downsampled to 256 Hz and a 0.3 Hz high pass filter. Regarding signal-to-

41
noise ratio (SNR) variations, the convetional Ag/AgCl electrodes have the highest SNRs by 19.9 dB mean value. On the other hand, the SNR of the tattoo electrodes was marginally below that of the Ag/AgCl electrodes by 19.3 dB, and capacitive electrodes had 12.7 dB of SNR value. Regarding skin-contact impedance measurements, Ag/AgCl electrodes had impedance of 96 k at 30 Hz and then falling down to 67 k after two hours of use. In contrast, both the capacitive and tattoo electrodes had impedances above 200 k.
(e) Figure 2.10: Measured ECG signals using (a) wet Ag/AgCl electrodes; (b) and (c) capacitive electrodes with different magnifications; and (d) proposed tattoo electrodes; tested electrodes are shown in (e): Ag/AgCl electrodes (left); proposed copper printed capacitive electrodes (middle); and Ag printed electrodes on tattoo paper (right) [28] Chlaihawi et al [29] proposed a flexible dry electrode based on multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite for ECG monitoring. Dry electrodes were generated by screen printing Ag ink on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, and then MWCNT/PDMS composite was coated onto the surface of the electrode. In order to see the performance of the proposed electrode, three same types of electrodes were fabricated in different sizes with radius of 8 mm, 12 mm, and 16 mm. The results were also compared to that of conventional Ag/AgCl electrode. Experimental studies showed that the proposed dry ECG electrode with the largest area (16 mm) exhibited better performance than conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes regarding signal intensity and correlation. Another flexible dry electrode with micro domes was proposed by Meng et al [30] based on PDMS for ECG monitoring system. The fabrication method of the proposed dry electrode was comprised of melting photoresist, double-PDMS-molding, Nickel (Ni) plating and encapsulation between two PDMS substrates. Similarly with the previous work, the researchers have developed three dry electrodes with different sizes to consider the performance of the proposed dry electrode. Experimental results revealed that the fabricated dry electrodes

42
provided a comparable ECG signal to that of conventional wet Ag/AgCl electrode without the need for skin preparation and use of gel. Moreover, skin-electrode contact impedance of the proposed dry electrode was decreased as the size of the electrode was increasing. Although the impedance of the proposed dry electrode with 80x80 arrays was larger than that of wet Ag/AgCl electrode at the beginning, the impedance of the wet Ag/AgCl electrode was increasing from around 15 k to more than 100 k after 6 hours. Nevertheless, the impedance of the fabricated dry electrode was stable at around 15 k even after 6 hours. Figure 2.11a indicates the sampling module ECG monitoring system, and Figure 2.11b ECG signals recording using lead V. Figure 2.11(c-h) shows the ECG signal measurements using different size of fabricated dry electrodes and Ag/AgCl electrodes.

Additionally, same research group [31] developed another dry electrode by depositing metal film on (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES)-anchored PDMS substrate for ECG recording system. They have used APTES solution before depositing metal film to overcome the adhesion problem

43
that gave poor connection between metal and PDMS substrate. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed dry electrode was carried out by skin-electrode contact impedance and SNR of the ECG signals and compared it to those of Ag/AgCl electrodes. The impedance variations illustrated that the proposed dry electrode had higher contact impedance (580 kΩ at 50 Hz) than conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes (390 kΩ at 50 Hz). Regarding ECG waveform experiments, obtained ECG signal using the proposed dry electrodes with micro domes was similar to that obtained using conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Clear observations of QRS-complex and T-wave cardiac points can be seen. Moreover, experimental results have revealed that SNR of conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes was higher than the fabricated dry electrodes with micro domes, 23.35 dB and 21.82 respectively.
Recently, there have several research activities on ECG monitoring using different types and materials-enabled electrodes. Following studies have been proposed in the last year (2016) to observe essential findings of ECG signal using different approaches to ECG monitoring systems. Liu et al [32] developed silver nanowire and PDMS based composite electrodes for long-term ECG monitoring. The fabricated electrode patch comprised of three composite electrodes and an adhesive PDMS layer is combined with a wireless acquisition system to obtain ECG signals. The composite electrodes consisted of a PDMS layer, silver nanowires (Ag NW) layer, carbon nanotubes adhesive PDMS (CNT-aPDMS) layer and integrated with Cu wires to enable the external circuitry, as can be seen in Figure 2.12a. After the fabrication process of the electrodes, three electrodes were integrated into an ECG patch within ECG acquisition system, which enabled wireless transmission through radio-frequency (RF) module, via connected Cu wires. Experimental results showed that the contact impedance of the proposed composite electrode was higher than that of the conventional Ag/AgCl electrode because of the low conductivity of the CNT-aPDMS layer, the monitored impedance values were 1.55 M and 651 k respectively at 10 Hz. Moreover, ECG waveform of the fabricated electrode was observed and compared with that of the Ag/AgCl electrode. Figure 2.12b shows the results at different sites for the proposed and conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. As can be seen in the figure, each wave of the ECG signal (P wave, QRS-complex, T waves) can be observed. Furthermore, ECG signals of each electrode type were indicated in the Figure 2.12b during different postures (sitting, standing, and walking). Even though the ECG signals were stable during sitting and standing postures, the signal was affected by walking posture as considerable amount of noise have been observed.

Similarly to the previous work, Lee et al [33] fabricated a self-adhesive ECG patch using CNT electronics for long-term ECG monitoring system. The self-adhesive patch consisted of a PDMS layer, an Au/Ti/Polyimide metal layer, a PDMS frame layer, and a CNT/aPDMS interfacial layer for signal acquisition. To evaluate the results, the comparison has been made between dry, Ag/AgCl and CNT/aPDMS electrodes with the same locations at the right arm (RA), left arm (LA), and left leg (LL) positions of the ECG patch. Figure 2.13 also shows the comparison results for motion artifacts and ECG measurements using three types of electrodes (dry, Ag/AgCl and CNT/aPDMS). Regarding the motions with different frequencies, the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the motion artifacts was substantially lower than that of dry electrodes for all motion frequencies, and the value was slightly smaller than that of Ag/AgCl electrodes at 3 Hz, as can be seen in Figure 2.13c. Figure 2.13f also indicates that the waveforms of CNT/aPDMS are comparable to those of conventional Ag/AgCl electrode, while there are significantly noisy and shows artifacts in the signals of the dry

45

electrode. Furthermore, skin-to-electrode contact impedance was 241 k at 40 Hz for the CNT/aPDMS electrode as compared to 74.2 k for the conventional Ag/AgCl electrode.

Pei et al [34] developed a dry electrode based on conventional microneedles array (MNA) to remove the interference of skin-potential variation (SPV). Based on this technique, Parylene membrane layer is coated to the root of the microneedles for insulating the electrode from the corneum layer. Thus, skin-potential variation will not affect ECG recording while the subject was moving around. They compared the impedance measurements of the commercial wet electrode,

46
conventional MNA-based electrode and proposed SPV-based dry electrode. According to the results, the skin-electrode contact impedance of the proposed dry electrode was similar (around 120 k) to that of commercial wet electrode (115 k) and higher than that of conventional MNA-based electrode (66 k) at 10 Hz. Likewise, the skin-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ECG signals measured by proposed SPV-based dry electrode, conventional MNA-based electrode and commercial wet electrode were 36.9 dB, 43.2 dB, and 44.5 dB respectively. Recently, Jang et al [35] fabricated a ferromagnetic, folded electrode composite for wireless electrophysiological acquisition systems. As can be seen in Figure 2.14, ferromagnetic, folded composite structure lays on a permanent magnet (NdFeB) layer. The transparent adhesive layer is coupled with ferromagnetic layer to provide adherent interfaces to the skin that maintains robust conformal contact. On the other hand, the magnet conducts a permanent electrical bond to the acquisition system. As in Figure 2.14c, the electrodes rest between the electrical lead-out (or magnet layer), and the skin. Furthermore, Figure 2.14d presents the proposed magnetic folded soft composite electrodes with wireless operation (Bluetooth module). Each electrode placed onto a permanent magnet (NdFeB) with a force that contributed an electrical contact from the skin and a mechanical bond. The group have developed several electrode types for recording ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG using this proposed electrode composite. Figure 2.14e also shows recorded ECG acquired with capacitive and direct contact electrodes from the chest indicated that P, QRS, and T waves were collected with a quality of measurement that is comparable to that of hydrogel electrode.

Poliks et al [36] investigated hybrid flexible electronics that integrate conventional printed circuits and thinned silicon chips in order to produce a wearable ECG and skin temperature sensor. The wearable monitor is consisted of a flexible polyimide substrate with printed ECG electrodes, thermistor, and a connecting traces printed on one surface using ECG conducting gel electrodes printed with gold ink, and the electronic components placed on the other surface. ECG signals were transmitted to a mobile phone wirelessly via Bluetooth after signal conditioning process to be monitored in real-time. The wearable device is in 2x2 inches in size and worn on the chest. The group has analysed the ECG recordings using proposed gel based printed electrodes by performing signal-to-noise ratio, peak detection, and heart rate variability. The experimental results demonstrated that the recorded ECG signals were comparable to those of archived and certified ECG signals at MIT-BIH database. Dai et al [37] developed a wearable ECG acquisition system using three proposed textile electrodes and a specialized circuit system. The proposed system used various digital filter methods to eliminate the baseline wander, thus reduce skin contact noise and also the system presented several methods to reduce the power consumption of the system. Furthermore, presented ECG system designed new type of electrodes using flexible polypyrrole textiles (FPTs) to increase the system performance by eliminating the need of electrolyte gel. Due to decreased electrochemical impedance between the skin and electrode [38], thus improved conductivity, the FPT electrodes were used, and the 5 x 4 cm fabric electrodes were integrated into the garment for ECG acquisition system. Figure 2.15a shows the structure of proposed FPT electrodes and Figure 2.15b illustrates wearable ECG unit on a sweatshirt. Regarding the performance of the system, a series of continuous impedance measurements were carried out for 8 hours to analyze the variation of contact impedance and also to compare them to those of wet Ag/AgCl electrodes. Results demonstrated that while the skin-electrode contact impedance of wet Ag/AgCl electrodes was increasing, the contact impedance of proposed FPT electrodes was decreasing which will be efficient for long-term ECG monitoring. Experimental results also revealed that the presented ECG acquisition system has lower power dissipation of 29.74 mW in full round of ECG acquired system when compared with two commercial ECG acquisition systems (Heal Force and BodiMetrics).

Figure 2.15: (a) The structure of proposed flexible polypyrrole textile electrodes (FPTe); (b) Distributions of electrodes based on sweatshirt with an ECG monitoring system [37] Another textile-electrode for ECG recordings was designed by Pani et al [38] based on woven fabrics applied with conducting polymers, poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Due to excellent characteristics of this conducting polymers group such as low band gap and high electrochemical stability, this research group has fabricated new type of electrode based on fabric soaking in PEDOT:PSS using a second dopant, squeezing and annealing. The proposed electrodes were tested for both skin-electrode contact impedance and the quality of ECG signals recorded at rest and during physical activity. The experimental results showed that the electrodes are good enough in both wet and dry conditions. However, dry type of electrodes had higher noise artifacts in particular during physical activity exercise. Wet type of proposed electrodes indicated that better contact impedance than dry ones, and they were comparable to that of traditional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Figure 2.16a illustrates the proposed PEDOT:PSS type textile electrode, and Figure 2.16b shows recorded ECG signals from a single subject during rest and different activities with dry and wet type of proposed electrodes and compared to those acquired with gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes. The results revealed that the gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes indicated better stability than dry textile electrodes, but worse than the wet

49 ones. Performance of wet textile and gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes were generally similar, however, dry textile electrodes exhibited higher sensitivity to high frequency noise.

The proposed electrodes were tested in three types of water: fresh water, chlorinated water, and salt water to see the qualities of recorded ECG signals. The developed hydrophobic CB/PDMS electrodes were fabricated based on filling conductive CB/PDMS composites on 3D printed cavity molds, and then a copper mesh was affixed on the CB/PDMS mix to allow signal acquisition via the monitoring device. A diagram of the proposed meshed CB/PDMS is shown in Figure 2.17a. Experimental results exhibited that

50

the proposed CB/PDMS electrode with integrated copper mesh indicated a high quality of ECG signal without any amplitude degradation in all types of water tested for 10 subjects. Regarding the electrode-skin contact impedance magnitudes, all 5 types of electrodes had comparable performance in the frequency range between 4 Hz and 1 kHz. The impedance characteristics of proposed CB/PDMS with and without copper meshed electrodes did not change throughout the frequency range (from 600 k to 80 K), however, other 3 types of electrodes had much lower impedances in wet conditions when compared to dry condition. According to the ECG amplitude studies of this work, Table 2.1 draws the signal amplitude reduction values of each electrode type between dry and wet conditions. Among all 5 electrodes types, the meshed CB/PDMS electrode was the most successful in preserving the ECG signal amplitudes in all types of water. Figure 2.17b shows the ECG recordings for all experimental conditions (dry, immersed, wet conditions) with the proposed meshed CB/PDMS electrode in fresh, chlorinated, and salt water. Regarding the results, all ECG waveforms (P waves, QRS complex, and T waves) were detected in all conditions and water types. Only, the meshed CB/PDMS electrode showed the best performance in chlorinated water for all conditions as can be seen in the Figure 2.17b. Furthermore, both mesh and non-meshed CB/PDMS electrodes also were evaluated for long-term test under water for 6 hours period of continuous use and exhibited that electrodes maintained ECG signal quality without a significant degradation.

The proposed multilayered dry electrodes were fabricated by screenprinting of Ag/AgCl conductive inks on non-woven fabrics, which is examined as a sensing platform (see Figure 2.18a). Impedance measurements were carried out on the printed dry electrodes with 10, 20, 30 mm diameters and 3M red dot wet Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as a reference measurement in the frequency range between 0.1 Hz and 1 kHz. The printed dry electrodes with 10, 20, 30 mm diameters had higher impedance values than wet electrodes (10 M, 8 M, 1 M, and 100 K respectively at 1 Hz) due to the absence of conductive medium at the

52 interface. The results from the experiments revealed that the larger electrode area, and stable skin contact, exhibited in higher ECG amplitudes, as can be seen in Figure 2.18b. A comparison of the printed dry electrodes was provided in Table 2.2, SNR of acquired signals were observed to be proportional to the printed area.

O’Mahony et al [41] also proposed polymeric dry ECG electrode that used microneedle structures to make a direct contact between the electrode and the body. Regarding the fabrication process, two moulds were attached to provide 500 m length of microneedle structure on the front side of a polymeric wafer, and electrical components and detachable arrays were on the back side. Afterwards, the wafers were metal-coated and integrated with a self-adhesive pad to configure ECG electrodes to be able to measure the electrical signs of cardiac heart in mV-amplitude. Based on the skin-electrode contact impedance, pairs of wet Ag/AgCl electrodes and the proposed dry microneedle electrodes were attached to the subject’s forearm and impedance measurement performed between 1 and 950 Hz frequency range. At the end of the evaluation, the impedance of the pre-gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes were between 30% and 33% lower than that of the proposed microneedle electrodes for all measured frequencies. The acquired ECG signals were comparable to those recorded using pre-gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes and all the waveforms (P wave, QRS complex and T wave) were clearly visible. Another observation from the experiments is that in contrast to conventional wet electrodes, SNR of ECG waveforms recorded using proposed microneedle dry electrodes was dependent on the skin-electrode contact force. Apart from fabric electrode fabrication, Aulia et al [42] designed a wearable ECG device that was studied in the regard of the electrode positions to fulfill the clinical placement. Moreover, a new way of electrode placement is developed in terms of a fitness lifestyle for continuous real-time healthcare monitoring in a form of a necklace. The proposed biomedical device has a single lead ECG analog front-end that is connected to the microcontroller unit (MCU), and it also composes of Bluetooth technology for wireless communication with an Android mobile phone to display ECG data on. ECG signal was acquired from the electrode placement at the backside of the neck shows Lead I waveform and heart rate can be calculated from recorded R peaks. Figure 2.19 shows the electrode placements on the backside of the neck, and proposed 3D-printed, necklace-form ECG device.

Imani et al [43] presented a wearable (skin-worn) hybrid sensing system that provides real-time monitoring of a biochemical (lactate) and an electrophysiological signal (ECG). The proposed hybrid wearable, Chem-Phys patch, composed of three-electrode (3 x 2.5 mm) for monitoring lactate and two ECG electrodes (1.5 x 1.5 cm2) for monitoring of ECG and heart rate. The fabrication of Chem-Phys patch was carried out by screenprinting technology on a thin (50 m thickness), human-skin-morphology-like polyester sheet to offer minimum noise signal. The fabrication of hybrid sensor system is shown in Figure 2.20a and 2.20b, as screen-printing process is done by a polyester sheet, and also Figure 2.20c indicates the block diagram of chemical-electrophysiological acquisition system including wireless transmission. A comparison was made using printed ECG electrodes and commercial wet Ag/AgCl electrodes to validate the proposed electrodes for ECG monitoring. The results showed that, as illustrated in Figure 2.20e, recorded ECG signals had similar morphologies when the same analog circuitry was used. Figure 2.20d also indicates the proposed Chem-Phys patch that fuses the monitoring of ECG with on-body chemical sensing into a printable wearable platform.

Another hybrid wearable sensor system is done by Khan et al [44] for measuring ECG and skin temperature. The proposed wearable hybrid patch system is shown in Figure 2.21, in detail, where ECG and temperature sensors are integrated into a sensing platform. The sensor patch was carried out by a pair of printed gold electrodes for ECG monitoring, and a printed nickel oxide thermistor for skin temperature monitoring (see Figure 2.21a). The hybrid wearable platform is assembled on a Kapton polyimide (PI) substrate that hosted the silicon-based integrated circuits (analog front-end, wireless components-Bluetooth system). The hybrid patch is proposed and designed on a 5.08 cm x 5.08 cm, 50 m thick flexible Kapton PI substrate (Figure 2.21b) for the need of the space between ECG electrodes to allow acquiring ECG data. The complete system was powered by a coin cell battery of 220 mAh capacity (8 hours battery lifetime), and was weighted by 6.1 g. Figure 2.21c-e illustrates wearable hybrid sensor patch mounted on a subject, and also printed sensor patch including electronic components. Experimental studies revealed that, recorded ECG signals provided peak-to-peak 0.6 mV using two gold printed electrodes compared to conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes which provided peak-to-peak 0.8 mV when placed on the chest.

The printed gold ECG electrodes and the thermistor are shown. [36, 44] Another application for measuring ECG of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the living environment is done by Takahashi et al [45] using textile electrodes within a wearable ECG monitoring device. The proposed device is developed in a clothe, and the ECG measurements were done through the wrists. During the tests, the ECG signals of three children with ASD were captured, and R-R intervals were obtained with high reliability (90% of the duration of tasks). Due to having difficulties for measuring a perfect ECG signal (including all morphologies), the group has focused on the R-R intervals from ECG signal regarding the mental stress by adopting a bipolar lead from three electrodes at two different places on the body. Figure 2.22a illustrates the system overview of the proposed device on the clothe, and also Figure 2.22b shows ECG waveforms

57 including captured R-R intervals using the Pan-Tompkins (PT) algorithm [46]. Regarding the experimental studies, three children with ASD wore the clothe with the proposed integrated device for the whole session (~60 min) under different therapeutic tasks (motor imitation, card selection, vocal imitation, exercise, manipulation, reading, playing). The results showed that the tasks of card selection and reading revealed measurements rates of over 90% for the all participants.

(b) Figure 2.22: (a) System overview of the proposed device that measures ECG signals at the wrist and ECG signals are transmitted to a tablet via Bluetooth connection; (b) ECG waveforms using the proposed device within PT algorithm and range detector [45] Liu et al [47] demonstrated the concept of carbon nanotube (CNT) based self-adhesive polymer electrodes integrated with a wireless long-term ECG monitoring system. The fabrication process of the proposed polymer electrodes was based on loading high proportion of CNTs in PDMS, which was filled onto the holes of the electrode, as a layer of adhesive PDMS. Additionally, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was used to increase the electrical conductivity of the electrodes and flexibility of the polymer. Figure 2.23b indicates the schematic of fabrication process of proposed CNT-based PDMS electrode within different layers. Wireless transmission was done through a radio frequency (RF) module to monitor ECG signals remotely in a mobile phone. Experimental

58 results exhibited that the skin-electrode contact impedance of developed adhesive CNT based polymer electrode was higher than that of the wet conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes due to the lack of the gel. The impedance values varied from 6.7 M to 89 k and 1.1 M to 11 k for the proposed CNT-based and Ag/AgCl electrodes, respectively, in the frequency range between 5 Hz and 1 kHz. For ECG measurements, the developed CNT-based three-electrode patch was attached onto the chest for five subjects during the tests. Figure 2.23a shows the comparison of ECG signals obtained by wet Ag/AgCl electrodes and proposed CNT-based polymer PDMS electrodes. Despite having similar ECG signals from both type of electrodes, the signal amplitude with the proposed CNT-based electrode was lower than that of the wet Ag/AgCl electrodes. The average amplitude of R-wave was 0.89 V and 0.98 V for the CNT-based PDMS and wet Ag/AgCl electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, this research group has also examined the long-term recording of the proposed polymer electrodes by detaching and re-attaching electrode patch after each day for 11 days. After 5 days, there was no significant variations on the obtained ECG signals, however, the signal has started to float during walking in the 6th day (6th attachment) due to decreasing of adhesion force, thus the electrode-skin contact was poor and motion artifacts became evident.
Figure 2.23: (a) Recorded ECG signals at the stationary state with conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes and proposed CNT polymer electrodes for comparison; (b) structure of the proposed ECG electrode patch composed of a PDMS layer, an aPDMS layer and the proposed CNT polymer electrodes [47] Regarding recent methods of capacitive coupling ECG signals, Mathias et al [48] designed a noncontact ECG electrode through micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) process. The developed ECG electrode is designed as 3 layers: a reference copper plate; an insulating material; and a sensing plate. The electrode lead wires were coaxially formed to block wires from coupling to

59
ground or other electronic components. The proposed ECG electrode has an area of 2.324 cm2, and could obtain the signal at about 500 m distance from the subject’s chest. Le et al [49] presented a mobile ECG monitoring device using two active dry electrodes. Normally, three-electrodes are used for acquiring good ECG signals, however, here two-electrode setup is designed and a digital notch filter was embedded into the circuit to reduce the power-line noise due to absence of third electrode. Furthermore, high impedance effect was reduced by a unity gain amplifier, which also reduced the interference from the environment. Regarding the experimental work, the proposed device was tested with 30 people to show heart rate values by comparing results with commercially available Omron HEM-7111 device. The results from the two devices showed nearly similar heart rate values, by making the correlation factor of 0.9914. Moreover, the group has investigated the quality of ECG signals of proposed ECG device using active dry electrodes in comparison with passive dry electrodes. The studies showed that acquired ECG signals by passive dry electrodes were less reliable than that of the active dry electrodes. Acquired R peaks using passive electrodes were around 0.5550.034 mV, on the other hand the R peaks of active dry electrodes were more stable at around 0.5580.034 mV.
In a recent work, Kim et al [50] developed a concept of conductive dry adhesives (CDA) that is based on gecko-inspired Si architectures and nanocomposites. Unlike the current dry adhesives, the group has studied here in CDA by combining carbon nanofillers and PDMS in a conductive elastomer. Two different forms of carbon nanomaterials, composing of a 1-dimensional (1D) CNT, and a 2-dimensional (2D) graphene (GN) nanopowder, were mixed into an elastomeric matrix for increasing electrical percolation. Figure 2.24a-e shows the concept, fabrication and functionality of the proposed conductive dry adhesives (CDA). The polymer PDMS layer embedding 1D-2D carbon nanocomposites with a low loading rate (~1 wt %) is distributed on the Si surface and filled into high-aspect-ratio holes (Figure 2.24a). The proposed CDA pad can also be wrapped on various surfaces and different places on the human body due to its flexibility and stretchability (Figure 2.24c-d). Furthermore, an LED experiment is done through the CDA pad as an electrical linkage with a weight of around 1kg (Figure 2.24e). Regarding the electrical characteristics of the proposed device, the CDA pad has achieved ~1 S/m electrical conductivity which is enough to obtain biopotentials from a human skin [51] at low carbon nanofiller content (~1.0 wt %). Regarding the experimental work, Figure 2.24f demonstrates the comparison of the ECG signals using the proposed CDA pad, and wet Ag/AgCl electrodes with 3M adhesives under normal conditions. Both type of electrodes achieved to indicate all morphologies of an ECG signal (P waves, QRS complex, and T waves). Figure 2.24g shows that the CDA pad was active underwater and biopotentials were still being acquired from the body with decreased amplitudes in an underwater environment,

60
however, conventional wet type of electrodes were detached from the body and biosignals were lost within 5 secs. In addition to this, proposed conductive dry adhesive based electrodes were tested in a series of movement conditions (wrist curl, squat, and writing), and the results revealed that ECG signals were still monitored during the tests including all available waveforms (see Figure 2.24h).

As we can see here, carbon-related materials have been used in several times for manufacturing ECG related electrodes. Another example to this, Thap et al [52] proposed novel ECG electrodes that were capable of acquiring signals under fresh-water, and salt-water conditions using Graphite, which is an allotrope of carbon and is also used in bio-mechanical manufacturing as an electron moderator [53]. Two-type of electrodes were developed based on graphite pencil leads: (a) pencil lead solid (PLS) type, and (b) pencil lead powder (PLP) type electrodes. Fabrication of PLS type of electrode was done by using 4B pencil leads which were cut into pieces and then these cutting leads were flattened to form a rectangle shape and so that a circular graphite based pencil lead was carried out after several chemical functions. On the other hand, PLP type of electrodes were synthesized through similar method by using graphite based 4B pencil leads as raw materials. After that, the pencil leads were peeled and grinded into a powder solution. After mixing with chemical bonds, the powder-pencil solution was poured into a cylindrical tube until to make it a flat and smooth surface. Figure 2.25g-h shows the both proposed type of electrodes which were fabricated with a diameter of 10 mm, and a thickness of 1mm which is the same size as the commercially available wet Ag/AgCl electrode for this study to compare all 3-type of electrodes. Experimental work was done by investigating the performances of the proposed PLS and PLP electrodes and comparing them with that of wet Ag/AgCl electrode in seven different conditions: dry, fresh-water immersion with/without movement, post fresh-water wet condition, salt-water immersion with/without movement, and post salt-water wet condition. Experimental results revealed that all ECG recordings were clearly visible (including PQRST waves), with all type of electrodes, under both dry and post fresh-water wet conditions. It was also observed that the proposed PLS and PLP electrodes exhibited better ECG signal quality than conventional Ag/AgCl electrode under the fresh-water and salt-water immersion with/without movement, and post salt-water wet conditions. Figure 2.25a-f illustrates the recorded ECG signals using all three-type of electrodes under different conditions. Furthermore, the skin-electrode contact impedance measurement was done for all PLP, PLS and conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Impedance characterization showed that the impedance of proposed graphite-PLP electrodes was lower than that of proposed graphite-PLS electrodes and conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. The skin-electrode contact impedance was 49.47 k, 51.37 k, and 86.12 k for graphite-PLP, and PLS, and conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes, respectively, at 40 Hz.

Among graphite and carbon-related nanomaterials, graphene (GN), which was recently invented by Geim and Novoselov [54], has received heightened attention for its exceptional physical, mechanical, electrical, chemical, and optical properties that lead to the wide range of applications from electronics to biomedicine [55, 58]. Recently, Yapici et al [59] developed conductive graphene (GN) textile electrodes using dip-dry-reduce process for biosignal acquisition in cardiac monitoring. The proposed electrode was fabricated by dipping nylon fabric in a graphene oxide (GO) solution, and the GO was chemically reduced into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) followed by a thermal treatment to allow dry process by coating with conductive GN layers around the fabric (see Figure 2.26a). The proposed GN-clad conductive textile electrode exhibited an electrical conductivity of 450 S/m, and it remained to form five cycles of washing. Regarding experimental results of this work, performance of the proposed GN-based textile electrodes were compared to the conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes in terms of ECG signal quality and skin-to-electrode contact impedance. Figure 2.26b shows recorded ECG signals using both proposed GN-clad textile and conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes with a cross correlation of 97% between the signals. Moreover, the proposed textile electrode-skin impedance ranged from 87.5 k to 11.6 k for frequencies swept from 10 Hz to 1 kHz, which was larger than that of the conventional Ag/AgCl electrode (varied between 50.9 k and 2.2 k at the same frequency range). Recently, the same group [191] developed a fully-wearable medical garment for mobile monitoring of cardiac biopotentials from the wrists and the neck using GN-functionalized textile electrodes. Comparison of the ECG recordings obtained from the wearable prototype against conventional wet electrodes indicated better conformity and spectral coherence among the two signals. Ameri et al. [192] demonstrated a GN-based epidermal sensor system with total thickness below 500 nm. The proposed system is fabricated by the cost-effective method on tattoo paper and can be laminated on human skin. Without any tape or adhesive, the proposed GN-based epidermal sensor system has been successfully applied to measure ECG, EEG, and EMG with comparable SNR to that of obtained by Ag/AgCl electrodes. In a recent work, Lou et al. [193] produced a flexible GN-based dry ECG electrode and a portable wireless measurement system. The experimental results in this work exhibited that the proposed GN-based dry electrode was able to acquire the typical waves and features of ECG signals with a high SNR in different states of motion. In addition, a week-long continuous measurement test showed no degradation in the ECG signal quality over time, in which it is useful for long-term ECG monitoring.

2.2 Review of body signal acquisition systems using different type of wearable sensors
In this section, various wearable health monitoring systems will be reviewed using different types of body-worn sensors. The combined information obtained from body sensors, such as ECG, EEG, CBT, PPG, can be transferred to a healthcare server in the case of emergency or can be stored and investigated as a part of preventive health issues. In this regard, Mundt et al [60] developed a wearable multi-parameter ambulatory physiologic monitoring system, called ‘LifeGuard’, for space and terrestrial applications. The proposed system provides the capability to measure two ECG leads, respiration rate via impedance plethysmography, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, blood pressure, and body movement. Commercially available sensors are used to record these physiological signals and are communicated via wired connections with the crew physiologic observation device (CPOD) data logger. The obtained physiological information can be continuously recorded for 9 hours on a memory card or transmitted to a base station using Bluetooth connection. Experimental works demonstrated that biosignals (SpO2 and heart rate) were measured in real-time satellite data streaming while CPOD was connected to the serial port of a tablet PC. Paradiso et al [61] proposed a wearable healthcare system by integrating fabric sensors, conducting and piezoresistive materials on vest-like garment to measure and monitor ECG, electromyogram (EMG), abdominal respiration rate, skin and core temperature, and body position and movements. The proposed system, called ‘WEALTHY’, is targeted for clinical patients such as elderly people and individuals with chronic diseases. The developed miniaturized system is integrated into shirt-garment and used to transmit the biosignals wirelessly to PCs, PDAs and mobile phones. The proposed algorithm is capable of generating alert messages to deliver appropriate health information to the doctors and patients.
In another project, Shnayder et al [62] developed a platform, called ‘CodeBlue’, to address issues of reliable communication between medical sensors and multiple receivers achieved by health professionals at Harvard University. The researchers have developed several medical sensors for multiple-patient-monitoring systems based on the ZigBee-compliant MicaZ [63] and Telos [64] motes, including pulse oximeter, three lead ECG, and motion activity sensor. A software algorithm also has been implemented to enable requests for specific biological data from a specified network node. Additionally, CodeBlue incorporated a decentralized RF-based localization system to be able to accurately locate patients, doctors or other caregivers for remotely medical purposes. Likewise, Pandian et al [65] presented a wearable physiological monitoring system which, is a washable shirt, called SmartVest, that consists of a vest and a variety of sensors integrated into the garment’s fabric to continuously monitor physiological signals, such as ECG, PPG, heart rate, blood pressure (BP), body temperature and galvanic skin response (GSR). The proposed wearable system was

66
implemented using microcontroller and wireless communication within global positioning system (GPS) modules. The collected biosignals are sampled at 250 samples/s, digitized at 12-bit resolution and transmitted wireless to a remote monitoring server along with the geo-location of the subject. Figure 2.27 shows schematic of the proposed wearable multi-parameter remote monitoring system including proposed device. SmartVest is designed by high-pass, low-pass, and notch filters to enable recording ECG signals without the use of gel and free of baseline noise and also motion artifacts. BP is extracted using a detection algorithm that individually calibrates based on the subject’s ECG.

the developed wearable data acquisition hardware [65]

As an example of mobile wearable monitoring system, Kwon et al [66] developed a smartphoneintegrated ECG recording platform, called ‘Sinabro’, which monitors the user’s ECG opportunistically during daily smartphone use. Based on this opportunistic ECG sensing theory, the ECG sensor is designed in the form of a phone case that can be integrated with a smartphone for unobtrusive sensing. The multiple electrodes are placed mostly at the corners, front, and back of the smartphone, which could allow maximal opportunities for ECG measurement when a user touches the phone with two body limbs during daily use, such as two hands when sending a text message or an ear and a hand when making a phone call. Sinabro is a collaborative system that includes the phone-case sensor and the smartphone middleware. The sensor reliably measures ECG data and transfers it to the middleware. The middleware delivers diverse ECG-derived contexts to multiple apps with Sinabro APIs. A similar mobile-based healthcare monitoring platform is carried out by Yap et al [67] using multiple body-worn sensors. As can be seen in Figure 2.28, the ECG sensor is

67 attached to user’s chest area to record ECG signal, on the other hand, the ear pulse oximeter sensor is clipped to user’s ear lobe, and finger pulse oximeter is clipped to user’s thumb to obtain PPG signal. Due to the integration of Kmote technology for ear and finger pulse oximeter sensors, both of the PPG signals are sampled and transmitted to portable base station via Zigbee transmission. After that, collected and processed ECG, ear PPG, and finger PPG signals are sent to user’s mobile device in real-time and simultaneously to display on an application. Furthermore, smartphone uploads the physiological signals to a server via Bluetooth connection. In the server side, a healthcare-monitoring algorithm is developed to display vital signals graphically for analyzing them to prevent any further serious medical issues.
Figure 2.28: Demonstration of Mobile healthcare monitoring system using portable base station, including ear PPG, finger PPG, and chest ECG sensors [67] Lin et al [68] studied a wearable PPG sensor module for a driver’s physiological monitoring system based on a Programmable System on Chip (PSoC). A couple of sensors are used for this work: (a) an optical sensor within magnetic rings for PPG measurement; and (b) a three-axis accelerometer (G-sensor) is used to detect head status. The sensor module is placed on the earlobe, and signal acquisition and analog circuits are designed in PSoC. Furthermore, a heart rate (HR) detection method is implemented derived from the Peak-Peak interval of PPG waveforms. The PPG data along with HR and head status are then transmitted to the smartphone for displaying health data via Bluetooth. According to their work, when the abnormal HR is detected, the smartphone will trigger the sound and vibration unit to alert the driver. This project is expected to reduce the traffic accidents due to the drivers’ physiological movements or health problems. Sanches et al [69] proposed a headset Bluetooth device for continuously monitoring core body temperature (CBT) at

68
the ear in the characterization and diagnosis of sleep disorders. An electronic temperature sensor (LM334) is fixed into the microphone of commercially available auricular Bluetooth device that continuously transmits the measured CBT at the inner ear to a paired mobile phone. Afterwards, the stored temperature data can be transferred periodically to a medical server for further analysis by email or SMS service. The proposed device is tested on a subject for 24 hours and results revealed that the ability of the system to record even small temperature changes along the circadian cycle. Another outcome from the tests also is that the maximum current consumption of the electronic thermometer was about 3 mA, which allowed reading around 500 samples in total test. Song et al [70] also developed a body monitoring system, which is a combination of measuring CBT, EEG and ECG, based on a smartphone via Bluetooth. They used infrared thermopile sensor [71] for monitoring CBT and the collected health data are stored in an SD card which is inserted in the Android based smartphone.
New studies have illustrated that ear-worn devices will bring high attention into the wearable technology due to ability of unobtrusive and comfortable design. Furthermore, as proven by hearing aids and headsets, the ear is a location for anchoring the devices. This could advance to device attachment without the need of adhesives [72]. Poh et al [73] proposed an ear-worn PPG monitoring system, called ‘HeartPhones’, that involves a reflective photo sensor which is integrated into each earbud on a pair of regular earphones. To obtain PPG measurements, a PPG peak detection algorithm is developed, thus the data can be monitored in 90 ms segments and can be extracted from the threshold values to avoid false peak detections. After sending raw PPG waveforms, average HR is also derived from algorithm and sent to the mobile device via serial communication for visualization and further processing. Alternatively, the measured PPG data can be transmitted wirelessly using a pair of wireless 2.4 GHz radio transceiver module. Figure 2.29 shows the proposed Heartphones system including wireless receiver unit. The proposed PPG sensor earphones have been tested on 31 healthy subjects, and obtained HR measurements. Furthermore, participants have been asked to attach adhesive Ag/AgCl electrode to their chests to record ECG signals as reference HR measurements. Experimental results exhibited that the recorded HR measurements using the proposed Heartphones system have agreed with 95 percent to those obtained via ECG adhesive electrodes.

Figure 2.29: Prototype of the Heartphones system which is either can be connected to smartphone via serial connection, or to PC via wireless link [73] Similarly, Da He et al [74] developed a compact multi-parameter monitoring device that measures ECG, ballistocardiogram (BSC), which is a measure of the body’s reaction force to the blood expelled by the heart [75], and PPG at the ear. Furthermore, a heart rate (HR) algorithm is developed using all measured three signals and the proposed monitoring device has been tested on 13 healthy subjects in a clinic to verify recorded data. Experimental studies showed that periodic head movements, as a type of BCG, have been identified and also HR can be extracted using cross correlation with all measured BCG, ECG, and PPG signals. Figure 2.30 indicates the proposed earworn wearable device along with measured ECG and PPG signals from behind the left ear. It can clearly be seen in Figure 2.30b that the obtained ECG signal only shows R peaks and other critical waves such as P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave are not visible due to lack of DRL electrode in ECG measurement setup. However, the proposed design is consisted of multiple physiological sensors that practically achieved to acquire ECG, BSC, and PPG from the ear within a design perspective of hearing aid.

The proposed organic optoelectronic devices were implemented using flexible plastic substrates that enable a conformal way for fitting to human body. In the developed pulse oximeter, an OLED emits in the red spectrum with 626 nm peak wavelength, and other OLED emits in the green spectrum with 532 nm peak wavelength. The organic optoelectronic pulse oximeter is integrated with the traditional electronics at 1 kHz and monitored HR and SpO2 are calibrated and compared to those recorded by commercially available pulse oximeter. Experimental results revealed that low error rate (1%) is observed for pulse rate, and 2% error rate is observed for SpO2 when comparing the organic optoelectronic sensor with the commercial one. The calculated HR is derived from PPG signals from organic optoelectronic sensor probes are around 65-70 beats per minute (BPM). Xu et al [77] developed a thin, conformable band aid form the device softly attached onto the skin to monitor physiological signals, including ECG,

71
EMG, and EEG. The proposed multi-sensory device (~1.7 x 1.8 cm2) was consisted of electrodes, electronic circuits, and radios for wireless communication in a soft microfluidic assembly. Figure 2.31 a-b shows the proposed sensor system attached onto the skin, Figure 2.31 c-d shows the obtained ECG signal, respectively, using the proposed flexible sensory system. The total power consumption of the proposed system is ~35 mW. Results clarified that recorded ECG signals included visible all waveforms, P waves, QRS complex, and T waves. Due to ECG signal being periodic, the HR also can be obtained from the R-R intervals of the ECG signal.

Kakria et al [78] demonstrated a real-time monitoring system that consists of a wearable sensor, mobile device, and a web interface to carry out recording of HR, BP, and body temperature. The commercially available wearable sensors have been used to acquire these physiological signals, which are then transmitted to an Android based mobile device wirelessly using Bluetooth. Afterwards, the gathered multiple health data on the smartphone is transferred to a web interface via WiFi or 3G system. Furthermore, the proposed remote wearable system generates the emergency alerts to the doctor or health assistant in case of abnormalities such as arrhythmia, hypotension, fever, and hypothermia. The proposed system has been tested on 40 cardiac patients in order to evaluate the practical implementation. The results exhibited that the proposed real-time monitoring system is validated and was sending alerts if recorded HR was higher than threshold value for tachycardia patients (~ HR > 100 BPM). However, false alarms have also been observed due to the battery issues of sensors during the tests in the proposed system. Another multi-parameter physiological acquisition module is developed by Kim and Ko [79] for low power wearable systems. They have presented a low noise reconfigurable analog-front-end (AFE) system which can be used in ECG, bioimpedance, EMG, EEG, and PPG sensory systems. The power consumption of the AFE in one readout channel is less than 52 W. Regarding experiments, a lead I ECG signals were acquired along with blood glucose levels to validate the proposed system. The results showed that the proposed multimodal reconfigurable system for several biosignal monitoring applications can reduce the required number of electronic chips.
Recently, Konijnenburg et al [80] developed a multi-parameter biosignal acquisition system with five dedicated channels: (a) ECG, (b) bioimpedance, (c) galvanic skin response, (d) 2 x PPG. The proposed system also includes a power management integrated circuit (PMIC), which is used for optimizing the power efficiency for multiple readout streams. The whole system is powered by a Li-ion rechargeable battery at 3.7 V. Figure 2.32a illustrates the proposed multiple sensory system in a wristband. When all five channels are enabled, the total power consumption is 1073 W for data collection and management in the system. Figure 2.32b shows recordings of both ECG and PPG data streams simultaneously, and they pointed that blood pressure (BP) can be derived from these two signal modalities using the pulse arrival time (PAT) [81]. PAT is defined as the interval time between the successive R-peaks of the ECG signal, and variable point on the rising part of the PPG signal. The figure 2.32b also shows large variations of BP due to asynchronized multiple data measurements.

The developed wearable system comprises of a wireless wearable device, a mobile device and a remote server. Furthermore, a smartphone application has been developed for the display of data related to HR, step count, exercise intensity, speed, distance, and calories burned, included with ECG waveforms and step cycle. Two-electrode circuits are used for ECG measurements, and a 3-axis accelerometer is used for the measurement of step signals. Data transmission is carried out by Bluetooth low energy between the wearable device and smartphone. Moreover, the collected information of HR, step count and GPS location are transferred to a remote server via 3G mobile network to locate the subject and monitor the activity status of the user by clinical staff of remote health care centre. In order to observe the performance of ECG peak detection, MIT-BIH ST Change Database [83] was used as open source input ECG data. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of ECG peak detection was around 99.7%.

74

New technologies revealed that vital biopotentials (especially BP and HR) can be derived by investigating only recorded ECG, and PPG signals [84]. Jain et al [85] demonstrated a portable multi-parameter signal acquisition system that monitors, stores and transmits ECG, PPG, SpO2, and Phonocardiogram (PCG), which is the graphic representation of sound generated by the heart, for a tele-monitoring application. The proposed device also provides BP, HR, QRS width, pulse transmit time (PTT), pre-ejection period (PEP) derived from acquired four biomedical signals mentioned above (ECG, PPG, SpO2, PCG). The research group has used ECG and finger PPG sensors to exhibit BP and HR extraction in the proposed wearable device. Figure 2.33a shows the proposed hardware unit for ECG and PPG acquisition. ECG sensors are attached on both the wrists and right leg using commercial bands, and PPG sensors is clipped on the right hand index finger of the subject. ECG and PPG signals are recorded simultaneously for 10 seconds followed by signal processing and plotting the graph on a PC. BP is extracted from both recorded signals; however, HR is derived only from ECG signal. Figure 2.33b shows the detected peak values for both ECG and PPG signals and Table 2.3 gives the extracted parameters from this figure. Regarding the evaluation of BP and HR, commercially available OMRON digital BP monitor is used for comparing the performance of the proposed device. Experimental results showed that mean absolute errors (MAE) were around 3.80 mmHg and 3.52 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP respectively when respected to OMRON device. Likewise, the recorded MAE was 2.26 BPM for HR measurements when respected to commercial OMRON device.

2.3. Summary
First of all, this chapter extensively reviewed the recent studies of ECG monitoring applications using different types of electrodes. Various methods such as gel, dry, and textile electrode types, were examined for ECG recording and the obtained results in terms of signal quality and skinelectrode impedance values have been compared with the traditional method of ECG monitoring which is the type of adhesive Ag/AgCl electrode. Furthermore, ECG acquisition systems have been reported using different types of materials such as Ag, Au, CNT, graphite and graphene with various flexible substrates such as PDMS. The recent technologies with different materials have improved the design and reduced the test requirements such as eliminating the need of gel, and skin preparation. However, the signal quality of the demonstrated results in the recent studies was not good as much as the conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. Due to high electrical conductivity values of Graphene, as it is investigated in this research, it can improve the signal quality of acquired ECG signals by lowering the skin-electrode contact impedance. Subsequently, a critical review of multiple smart sensor systems was provided for personalized healthcare monitoring and management, in particular ECG, CBT, and PPG monitoring systems.

80
CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND TO MULTIPLE PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING SYSTEMS
In this chapter, the theoretical background of electrocardiogram (ECG), core body temperature (CBT) and photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements will be given, respectively. It comprises three sections, with the first focusing on the electrical activity of the heart, ECG physiology, including lead positions and the electrical model of ECG measurement. CBT measurement analysis is covered in the second section by considering the mathematical functions and calculations on how CBT is measured from the ear. Finally, the analytical background of PPG is provided including the algorithm of taken measurements for calculating the heartbeat and SpO2 data from the finger.
3.1. Analysis of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Measurement
Since the development and evaluation of the proposed smart sensor system throughout the thesis is focused on the ECG, this section also gives a brief background of the anatomy of the heart and physiology to understand better how the concept of ECG works. Moreover, ECG waves and lead positions, the electrical model of ECG measurement and skin-electrode interface are explained in the following subsections. The importance of ECG electrode interfaces and how they interact with electrolyte gel and skin are also discussed in this chapter. Finally, signal processing research of ECG data is briefly covered together with a method of heartbeat detection.
3.1.1. The Anatomy of the Heart
The heart is a muscular tissue, the size of a fist size, consisting of four chambers: left and right atria, and left and right ventricles. It functions as the distributor of molecules, hormones, and body temperature to the billions of cells by pumping the blood throughout the body. As can be seen in Figure 3.1, each atrium is placed above a ventricle, with the right one being filled with blood via the superior and inferior vena cava. Then, the blood moves passively into the right ventricle under simple pressure, which is pumped into the pulmonary artery by contraction of the right ventricle and into the nearby pulmonary circulation of the lung. In the lung, the blood is exposed to air in the alveoli, releasing CO2 and binding with O2. In return, the pulmonary veins receive this oxygenated blood and return it to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. In the same way, the blood passes down passively through the left ventricle. Here, the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta to complete systematic circulation for the body. After delivering blood within molecules with high levels of O2 molecules and hormones to the cells, CO2, metabolic waste products, and metabolites are transmitted back to the right atrium via the vena cava. Another interesting point is

81 that the heart muscle is different from skeleton muscles. First of all, cardiac muscle cells are triggered by its own autorhythmical cells and thus, activated without any required action. Moreover, cardiac muscle fibres are bonded to one another by intercalated disks, which include gap junctions. These gap junctional proteins allow for very low resistance conduction from cell to cell in the cardiac muscle. Simultaneous contraction is essential, if a coordinated force is to be established to pump blood out of the heart on each beat. Moreover, the heart is the first organ to function in a human embryo and continues to work throughout its life. In order to maintain this continual muscle effort, heart cells are fueled with very rich mitochondria, which provide the ATP required for contraction [86]. Figure 3.1 illustrates the basic structure of the heart and the path of the blood flow through it.
Figure 3.1: Heart structure and the path of the blood flow [86] 3.1.2. Electrical Activity in the Heart All cardiac muscle contraction is stimulated by the operation of an electrical signal; an action potential that is continuously provided by the heart itself. The cellular mechanism in a cardiac muscle tissue begins the cardiac action potential by triggering a sinoatrial node (SA node). The reason for the commencement of the action potential is activity of the ion channels in the cardiac cell membrane. That is, the cell membrane has ion channels that arrange the diffusion of ions along their electrochemical gradient. There are three types of voltage-gated ion channels to initiate

82 pacemaker action potential (triggering SA node). The first is a the Na+ channel, which opens at approximately -60 mV. As Na+ ions enter the cells of the SA node, the membranes are depolarised and gradually the membrane potential reaches the voltage capacity of a Ca2+ channel, which opens at around -50 mV. As Ca2+ ions enter the cells, the membrane depolarises further, unless the voltage range of the channel reaches 0 mV, in which case the last K+ channels open. In the SA node, only the calcium channels play a role in the final depolarisation of the action potential. The depolarisation process stops at 0 mV and by opening the K+ channels, K+ ions leave the cells and repolarisation starts. This is the difference between the SA node and any other process, whereby K+ ions repolarise the cell and the membrane potential returns back to -60 mV to begin the next action potential (see Figure 3.2). Another interesting point of this mechanism is that there is no resting membrane potential in the SA node [87].
Figure 3.2: Electrical activity in a pacemaker cell (SA node) [87] Regarding the conducting system of the heart, five major structures can be described within its network. Figure 3.3 shows these main structures in terms of their locations in the heart. The sinoatrial node (SA node) is located in the right atrium wall and contains pacemaker cells from which action potentials are formed at regular intervals by the changing ions in these cells. As a result, the electrical impulse arises in this node for heart contraction (the sinus rhythm), and hence, is often referred as “natural pacemaker of the heart” [88]. Subsequently, this SA nodal electrical impulse propagates in several directions: to the left atrium (Bachman’s bundle) [89], and to the intermodal pathways, which lead into the atrioventricular node (AV node). This is located in the medial wall of the right atrium, near its junction with the right ventricle. The pacemaker cells in the AV node have very low conduction values, thus the speed of depolarisation in the AV node is very

83 slow and this causes a delay from when action potentials form in an AV node cell for 0.1 sec. From the AV node, the action potential is transferred to a structure called the atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle) or Bundle of His, which conducts the impulse through the interventricular septum. Soon after, the interventricular septum is bifurcated into two separated branches, called the AV bundle branches. Once the signal has travelled down to the apex of the heart, the action potential is conducted up both the left and right walls of the ventricle through branched tracts of pacemaker cells, referred to as the Purkinje fibres, which run up the electrical signal to the ventricular walls. Finally, the action potential moves between the ventricular cells, until and both right and left ventricular are depolarised. These electrical changes occurring throughout the cardiac cycle can be monitored and recorded using the electrocardiogram technique, which is explained in depth in the next section [86].
Figure 3.3: The conduction system of the heart and the path of cardiac excitation [87] 3.1.3. ECG Wave and Lead Positions Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is referred as a non-invasive measurement of the sum of all electrical activity in the heart [90]. An ECG does not give the action potential, but rather, the total electrical changes throughout the cardiac cycle provided while the action potentials travel in the heart from the SA node to the AV node, bundles, and Purkinje fibres via the interventricular septum for the depolarisation and repolarisation process. Figure 3.4 illustrates a typical ECG signal in terms of its basic components.

84
Figure 3.4: Major components of a typical electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform [87] According to the picture, there are three main wave parts in a basic ECG diagram and several baseline segments. The P wave represents atrial depolarisation, which initiates at the SA node. The PR segment demonstrates AV nodal delay, which is the time taken for the cardiac impulse to be distributed from the atrium to the AV node and bundle system. The QRS complex (wave) pertains to the ventricular depolarisation with simultaneous atrium repolarisation. The T wave corresponding to the ventricular repolarisation and the TP interval, represents the time of ventricular relaxing as well as preparing for the next depolarisation. Figure 3.5 shows the events in the heart in depth during cardiac conduction. Before setting an action potential, there is still a small electrical signal in the SA node and then the impulse is generated in this node (a-P wave). Once it is depolarised and atrium contraction has happened (b-P wave), the electrical signal slowly reaches the AV node and travels down through the AV bundle branches (cbeginning of QRS complex). After this, the signal expands to the ventricular wall via the Purkinje fibres for ventricle depolarisation (d-QRS complex). Finally, during the T wave, the ventricle repolarises and the heart makes itself ready for the next depolarization, which will be initiated from the SA node. The baseline segments in an ECG signal reflect when there is no ongoing depolarisation or repolarisation process during the cardiac cycle.

85
Figure 3.5: ECG Genesis while the cardiac cycle is coordinating the activity [87] A number of intervals can be measured and analysed from an ECG recording, with a normal signal giving very important information regarding the heart status during a cardiac cycle. The time between the beginning of a particular point in a cycle and the beginning of another particular point in the next cycle is the interval between the commencing of the electrical response of those points in the heart. For example, Figure 3.6 demonstrates a normal ECG for two beats of the heart.
Figure 3.6: A normal electrocardiogram (ECG), including particular intervals [91] Regarding the diagram, the P-R interval, which means the duration between the beginning point of a P wave and the peak of an R wave, illustrates the depolarisation of the atrium. In addition, this interval gives the information of how long an electrical impulse will pass through the ventricle from the atrium, including AV delay. Generally, the P-R interval takes between 0.14 and 0.16 seconds. During the Q-T interval, which refers to the duration between the Q point and the starting point of a T wave, the ventricles become in a depolarised state. The Q-T interval reveals the amount of time

86

that blood is being pumped out of the heart and into the arteries, which ordinarily lasts about 0.35 seconds. The most known interval is the R-R (beat-to-beat) interval, which indicates the time between two consecutive QRS complexes in an ECG recording. Looking at this interval, the heart rate can be measured by a simple calculation, as explained later in this chapter. Lastly, the S-T segment, which endures from the S point until the beginning of the T wave, is a crucial interval for diagnosing heart-related problems, such as a heart attack or depression in individuals with coronary problems.
In general, ECG recording provide essential information for assessing cardiac anomalies [92]. For instance, long Q-T or S-T intervals might help in diagnosing serious health problems, such as hypothermia, or ischemia. A typical ECG lasts between 720 and 780 milliseconds. Table 3.1 shows a summary of ECG waves and intervals including durations.

A conventional ECG signal comprises tracing from 12 viewpoints for recording cardiac electrical activity [93]. Each point is obtained by recording the electrical potential between a pair of electrodes (positive and negative electrode), called a ‘lead’. Twelve viewpoints correspond to 12 leads, which can be separated into two parts: six limb leads (bipolar and unipolar leads, as can be seen in Figures 3.7a and 3.7b); and six chest leads. The ECG is normally recorded using three electrodes, one on each arm, and another one placed on the left leg (Einthoven’s triangle) [94]. Furthermore, recordings are commonly made using six chest electrodes (unipolar precordial leads). According to Einthoven’s theorem, the three limb electrodes can be connected across a voltmeter and an ECG signal can be recorded in three different combinations, called three bipolar limb leads,

87

which are denoted as I, II, and III [94]. In recording limb lead I, the negative electrode is connected to the right arm and the positive terminal to the left. For lead II, the negative terminal of the ECG is connected to the right arm and positive electrode will be placed on the left leg. Finally, in lead III, the negative electrode will be on the left arm and the positive will be connected to the left leg. Consequently, when the negative side is measured negatively with respect to the positive side, then the ECG will be recorded positively. According to Einthoven’s law, bipolar limb leads are calculated as:

lead I = VLA (Voltage of Left Arm) – VRA (Voltage of Right Arm)

(3.1)

lead II = VLF (Voltage of Left Leg) – VRA (Voltage of Right Arm) lead III = VLF (Voltage of Left Leg) – VLA (Voltage of Left Arm)

(3.2) (3.3)

Figure 3.7: 12-Lead System: (a) Bipolar limb leads; (b) Unipolar limb leads; (c), (d), (e) Chest leads [93]
Figure 3.7b illustrates unipolar limb leads (aVR, aVL, and aVF), which measure the exact electrical potential at the place of the positive electrode (placed on the right arm, left arm, and left leg, respectively). The signals are augmented, because the results are too small to be used, thus they are also called augmented leads. In Figures 3.7c, 3.7d, and 3.7e the chest lead placement and horizontal plane are shown. There are six chest leads (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6) in order to record the electrical signal of the heart using chest-type electrodes. By combining all the described leads together, a conventional 12-lead system is formed as the basis of a modern clinical ECG measurement system.

88 3.1.4. ECG Measurement and Electrode Properties In order to obtain a reliable ECG, the electrodes are commonly used to carry out the measurement chain. As mentioned and reviewed earlier, there are different types of electrodes made using several techniques, including gel, dry, non-contact, capacitive, textile, nanomaterial-based electrodes for ECG monitoring systems. If they are used incorrectly, there will be unwanted distortion of order of magnitude larger than the ECG itself. Figure 3.8 introduces the typical measurement system for ECG recording consisting of two or more metal-lead (generally Ag/AgCl electrodes) electrodes attached to the skin and connected to a differential amplifier.
Figure 3.8: Schematic circuit of a typical ECG measurement system with a DRL connection [95] The goal of the right leg drive circuit is to reduce interference from the amplifier. When an ECG signal is amplified by an instrumentation amplifier, it is possible to create a DC common mode interference. The drive right leg (DRL) connection inverts and amplifies the common mode signal back into the right leg of the person as shown in the figure. As a consequence, the 60-Hz common mode bias from AC power is avoided, thus leading to a better ECG signal. In order to get a clearer ECG signal at the output of the instrumentation amplifier, this is filtered to reduce the noise and then the denoised signal is sent to an operational amplifier that conditions the signal to better levels for the microcontroller for further signal processing algorithms of the ECG signal. After filtering and converting signals to the appropriate levels, the obtained ECG signal is transmitted to a

89 monitoring device, as shown in Figure 3.9. In the proposed system [96] shown in the figure, there is an insulation layer between the electrodes and body so that there will be a high input impedance of the measurement system due to the capacitively coupled electrodes and the interacting extra impedance of capacitance. The equivalent circuits of typical ECG measurement systems and their impedance calculations for the various types of electrodes are discussed in the next subsection.

3.1.5. Electrical Model of the Skin-Electrode Interface The term of “electrode” comes from the study of electrochemical cells, where electrical transport is conducted via oxidation and reduction (redox) reactions taking role between the metallic layer and electrolyte gel [97]. In accordance with several studies, the wet type of conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes are fitted to this description due to their metallic layer being bathed in an electrolyte gel that shields the electrical composition through the outer and inner layers of the body surface. It is worth noting that the impedance, Z, includes elements (resistance or capacitance) sourced from body tissue (epidermis, dermis, stratum corneum), the skin-electrolyte interface, the electrolyte, the

90 electrolyte-electrode interface and the electrode leads. Accordingly, the wet type conventional electrode is well-characterised by double layer capacitance and parallel series resistors for coupling electrical signal through the skin. In contrast, dry and non-contact types of electrodes are more complex due to additional input impedances that cause difficulties for skin-electrode coupling. Figure 3.10a shows an equivalent electrical circuit of a model from the body to the electrode, and Figure 3.10b illustrates the electrical coupling of skin-electrode interfaces for various electrode topologies.

It is important to realise that low resistance (impedance) is essential for good electrode performance, thus effecting ECG signals in a better way. To this end, the wet type conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes are used in clinical applications today as they provide better ECG signals than other types of electrodes due to lower skin-electrode impedance values.

3.1.6. ECG Signal Processing and Heartbeat Detection
ECG signals have been controlled for signal processing to enhance the signal quality by filtering techniques. Another benefit from signal processing that it facilitates detection and quantification of signal properties. For instance, an ECG waveform is indicated in Figure 3.6 with the parameters of ECG morphology when interpreting its diagnostic information. Cardiac pathologies are extracted using these parameters (P wave, QRS complex and T waves) and cardiac diseases are monitored as changes from normal values of these parameters. For example, as mentioned earlier, a small change in the S-T segment, which starts at the S point and lasts until the beginning of the T wave, can be a vital deviation for diagnosing heart-related problems, such as a heart attack or depression in individuals with a coronary problem. Similarly, R peaks play a key role in detecting heartbeats

92 using their peak points and the R-R interval time series is the first information to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV). Normally, ECG information is investigated under the frequency content of 100 Hz with a significant frequency range of 10 Hz for the QRS complex, as can be seen in Figure 3.11. Signal processing within ECG applications is carried out generally in three steps: (a) pre-processing; (b) heartbeat detection; and (c) post-processing. Firstly, the influence of some disturbances, such as power line interference or motion artifacts, needs to be reduced in the pre-processing stage using an infinite impulse response (IIR) notch filter or Butterworth digital filter (band-pass filter). After this, R waves, which are the mostly used to represent the occurrence of a heartbeat, are formed thus facilitating heartbeat detection. Lastly, in the post-processing stage, the acquired and filtered ECG signals are compared and classified according to the total segmentation of the different waves associated with analysis of the heart rate time series.
Figure 3.11: The ECG signal spectrum [98] Regarding heartbeat detection, several algorithms are applied to identify heartbeats correctly. The most common method is to determine the peaks of R waves and to calculate the time series between these peak points. Friesen et al [99] compared nine different types of non-adaptive QRS detectors with noisy ECG signals and the best result was shown for algorithms using the first derivative only. A widely used method for heartbeat detection is known as the Pan-Tompkins method, which was mentioned earlier [46]. As can be seen in Figure 3.12, the proposed method involves the steps of

93
pre-filtering, differentiating, squaring, moving average integration and finally, decision rule after thresholding.

Figure 3.12: Schematic overview of the Pan-Tompkins heartbeat detection method [46]

To sum up the heart rate calculation, a typical ECG signal of a person heartbeat can be sectioned into three parts, as shown in Figure 3.6 [91]: the P wave, which illustrates the beginning and completion of the atrial depolarisation of the heart; the QRS complex, which conducts the ventricular depolarisation; and lastly, the T wave which manages the ventricular repolarisation. The R-peak in the ECG signal is the most important parameter for calculating heart rate and is easy to distinguish from noisy components and other parameters due to its large amplitude. Lee et al. [100] developed a variable threshold method to detect the R-peak further, the formula for which is given below.

VTH = [x(n) – x(n-1)] * 70%

(3.4)

Here, the R-peak can be differentiated from the baseline, which corresponds to 70% of recorded ECG peak signal detection. In addition, the formula for determining HR from R-R intervals provided by Lee et al. [100] is given below. In clinical environments, heart rate is generally measured as beats per minute (BPM).

Heart Rate (HR) in BPM = 60,000 / RR Interval (ms)

94 3.2. Analysis of the Core Body Temperature (CBT) Measurement The measurement of core body temperature (CBT) is essential for diagnosing and preventing serious climatic injuries, such as hypothermia, hyperthermia, and heat stroke, especially during exercise, sport activities and infectious diseases. Here, a brief background of core body temperature measurement is given and this is followed by analysis of the non-invasive measurements of CBT. The anatomy of the ear is described and the process of measuring CBT using an infrared thermopile sensor, which is applied for this purpose throughout this section. 3.2.1. Background of Core Body Temperature (CBT) and Thermal Imaging Core body temperature (CBT) measurement is one of the oldest methods for diagnosing diseases and a significant indicator of health in both personal life monitoring and medical care [101]. Human CBT can vary from day to day, but these variations have small margins, being generally no more than 1.0C. CBT is kept in the normal range (between 36.1C and 37.2C) by the thermoregulatory centre in the hypothalamus [102]. The aim of monitoring CBT is to capture any signs of systemic infection in the presence of fever or to discover whether it is too high above normal temperature, i.e. there is hyperthermia or very low, in the case of hypothermia. It is invariably clinically important to observe the trend in a patient’s temperature on a daily basis. Figure 3.13 shows the thermal imaging of a human body as the temperature of the internal body varies through its surface.

There can be different factors can affecting the human thermoregulation system. When assessing the core temperature of the body, it is worth noting that the CBT should be in the optimum range, which is between 36.1C and 37.2C for adults, but it can vary depending on gender, age and the site of measurement [101]. Table 3.3 gives some CBT values corresponding to related diseases or body system infection, whilst Table 3.4 shows the human body temperature range according to ageing status.

3.2.2. Measurements of Core Body Temperature (CBT)
CBT measurements can be carried out using invasive and non-invasive methods. Regarding the former, temperature readings can be taken from the following locations.
(a) Rectal: This location is commonly used for measuring CBT with accurate readings and generally, recorded temperatures from here are higher than from the other areas. The rectum site is mostly used in scientific research for heat exhaustion and stroke occurrences, particularly for babies. Moreover, this method has a long response time compared to other methods for CBT measurement [104].
(b) Oesophagus: This site is preferred for recording CBT due to its deep body location close to the left ventricle, the aorta and to the blood flow to the hypothalamus [105]. Furthermore, this method is chosen for its quick response readings. Nevertheless, it is difficult to insert a thermistor to read CBT via this method.
(c) Pulmonary Artery: The readings for this method are acquired through a catheter. This measurement is the most accurate method, because the artery brings blood directly from the core body surroundings [106].
However, invasive methods are undesirable for measuring CBT due to the difficulties of inserting medical devices into specific locations of the body. Hence, non-invasive methods are generally preferred for recording it owing to their rapid response and the easy to use equipment. The noninvasive measurements for CBT monitoring are as follows.
(a) Oral: This method is the most popular method, especially during clinical experiments. Whilst this measurement has the advantages of easy accessibility and giving very quick response times, it can be problematic for babies and small children because of the required behaviour.
(b) Axilla: It can take longer to read CBT than oral measurement and researchers have found that measuring it here is less accurate than in the rectum or at the tympanic membrane [107].
(c) Tympanic Membrane: This type of measurement is ideal, because the tympanic membrane and thermoregulation centre in the hypothalamus are fed by the same arterial blood supply flowing from the carotid artery and thus, it is considered that the it reflects the core

97 temperature [108]. This method of measurement and analysis of the tympanic membrane is explained in detail in the next subsection. 3.2.3. Anatomy of Ear in CBT Measurement Tympanic membrane measurement for CBT, which can be defined infrared ear thermometry, became a popular alternative with several advantages compared to that of traditional measurements [109]. First of all, infrared ear thermometry measurements provide rapid response and secondly, they are easy to use and convenient both for patients and health clinicians. Moreover, the risk of exposure to infectious diseases is reduced for clinical staff throughout the CBT measurement [110]. On the other hand, the accuracy of tympanic membrane measurement for CBT is still of concern, when comparing the results to those of rectal temperature measurement for which studies have revealed contradictory results [111]. The tympanic membrane site takes the blood from the internal carotid artery, which also supplies blood to the hypothalamus in the brain for the thermoregulation centre and the ear thermometer has been developed for this specific area to measure CBT. Furthermore, the ear canal is accessible for reading CBT from the tympanic membrane, as can be seen in Figure 3.14. When the temperature of the tympanic membrane is 37.3C, it stands at between 34.5C and 36.6C in the ear canal (see Figure 3.24).
Figure 3.14: Obtaining the tympanic temperature by aiming the probe towards the inferior third of the ear canal [112]

98 3.2.4. CBT Measurement using an Infrared Thermopile Sensor The most popular non-invasive method for measuring CBT is from the ear canal. Using infrared waves, it is possible to do so with a rapid response by just attaching the probe inside the ear canal. There are two locations in the ear where CBT can be measured, namely the ear canal and tympanic membrane, which gets blood from a branch of aorta that also supplies it to the hypothalamus in the brain for the thermoregulation centre [104]. Hence, the tympanic membrane is very important location in the body for measuring CBT. When an infrared thermopile sensor within a probe is placed in the ear canal, the waveguide takes infrared radiation from part of the ear canal, or tympanic membrane depends on the viewing angle and distance from the target object. Figure 3.15 shows a drawing of how a thermopile sensor transmits the infrared radiation to an object in principle. The targeted objects emit infrared radiation proportionally, depending on the viewing angle, for reading current temperature. Subsequently, the absorbed infrared radiation by the thermopile sensor leads to a temperature difference compared to the original temperature of the sensor. This difference in temperature is proportional to the amount of infrared radiation absorbed and thus, the temperature of the tympanic membrane can be retrieved from this difference [113].
Figure 3.15: Principle inner working of an infrared thermopile sensor [113] In theory, the thermopile sensor radiates electromagnetic waves into the surroundings including IR radiation [114]. According to Peng et al., the correlation between the radiation energy density and temperature of a targeted object is in accordance with Planck’s law when using a tympanic

99

membrane thermometer [114]. Since the radiated energy is related to an object’s temperature, the following equation (3.6) is deployed to obtain E (radiant exitance):

E = (T4 – T40)

(3.6)

In the equation (3.6), E corresponds to the radiant exitance, W.m-3;  is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 5.67x10-8 W.m-2.K-4;  is object radiation rate; T is the temperature of an object, K; and T0 corresponds to the ambient temperature around the object, K. In the proposed system, a Melexis MLX90614 infrared thermopile sensor [115] is employed to measure CBT from the ear. This type of tympanic membrane thermometer has high accuracy, particularly for a human body temperature monitoring system and the principle of this thermopile sensor will be explained in depth in a later chapter (Chapter 6) through experimental studies and subsequent discussion.

3.3. Analysis of Photoplethysmography (PPG) Measurement
This section describes what photoplethysmography (PPG) is and how it can be measured as well as from which sites of the body. It is also explained how heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) can be determined from PPG waves. Furthermore, a basic correlation is illustrated between PPG and ECG waves.

3.3.1. Background to Photoplethysmography (PPG)
PPG is a non-invasive optical measurement technique for the detection of cardiovascular pulse waves produced around the human body [116]. The principle of PPG sensors is optical detection of blood volume changes in the appropriate sites or tissues of the body by deploying light intensity technologies. Blood flow differs during cardiac cycle activities. For example, blood volume can be higher in the arteries during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle than during the diastolic phase. The aim of PPG sensors is to detect changes in the blood flow volume during these cardiac cycle events. After analysing the changes in the blood flow, PPG can provide information about vital body signs, such as heart rate (HR), arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure and cardiac output, thus making important for wearable sensing technology [117].
The basic principle of the PPG method is that it requires a couple of opto-electronic components: a light source (e.g. infrared LED) to illuminate the tissue (e.g. finger); and a photo detector (PD) to measure the variations in light intensity related to the changes in the blood volume. These variations at the PD are amplified, filtered and finally recorded as a voltage signal, which is called a PPG signal. There are two components in a PPG signal. Figure 3.16 illustrates an example of a PPG waveform, including direct current (DC), and alternating current (AC) components. The DC

100 component of the PPG signal corresponds to the detected reflected optical signal from the tissue, depending on the nature of the tissue and also the average blood volume of both venous and arterial blood. It is worth noting that the DC component of the PPG signal changes slowly with respiration and thus, it is a relatively constant voltage according to the AC component of the PPG signal. On the other hand, the AC component of the PPG waveform indicates the changes in the blood volume during cardiac cycle events (e.g. the systolic and diastolic phases). The pulsatile component of a PPG signal, the AC component, has its fundamental frequency typically around 1 Hz depending on HR. It is the most significant part of the PPG signal, because it gives the information on HR and other cardiac outputs, whilst also being superimposed onto the DC component [118].
Figure 3.16: Variations in blood volume in light attenuation by tissue [118] A PPG signal is operated by a red and near infrared (IR) wavelength from a light source. Anderson et al. studied the optical characteristics of light for human skin [119]. According to their analysis, the dominant absorption peak is observed within the blue region of the spectrum, followed by the green-yellow region (between 500 and 600 nm wavelengths), which corresponds to red blood cells. Consequently, this shows that PPG signals can be observed using IR wavelengths as light sources, such as IR LEDs (at around 600 - 800 nm near-IR wavelengths). There are two main modes of PPG signal detection: (a) transmission mode, where the tissue sample (e.g. fingertip or ear lobe) is placed between the light source and PD, so that the light is transmitted through the medium and is detected by the PD; (b) reflection mode, where the IR LED and PD are placed side-by side, so that the PD detects the reflected light from the tissue or blood vessels. Figure 3.17 shows both types of modes for detecting PPG signals.
