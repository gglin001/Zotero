Introduction

Numerous studies have indicated that in a variety of cardiac diseases the influence of heart rate on cardiac function is altered and that both heart rate and heart rate variability are of great relevance for the prognosis of cardiac patients.
Heart rate is an important determinant of cardiac function. In humans and most animal species, increased heart rate during exercise enhances cardiac output through an increased number of beats per minute as well as by its action on myocardial performance. The latter effect, termed the force-frequency relation, strength-interval relation or TREPPE (staircase) phenomenon was first observed by Bowditch in the isolated frog heart. Recent studies demonstrated that in failing human myocardium the force-frequency relation is flattened or inversed. The altered force-frequency relation results from disturbed function at the level of the myocyte due to disturbed calcium homeostasis. The latter may be the consequence of altered transsarcolemmal calcium influx, altered sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake and release as well as of altered sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchange. Knowledge of the subcellular defects underlying disturbed calcium homeostasis may allow the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat heart failure patients. In addition, the finding of an altered force-frequency relation in the failing human heart may suggest that heart rate reduction is of critical importance for patients suffering from heart failure. In this regard, the beneficial effects of j3-blockers as well as of amiodarone observed in patients with congestive heart failure may be partially related to the effect of those agents on heart rate.
During the last decade many studies also demonstrated that heart rate and heart rate variability have significant impact on arrhythmogenesis and prognosis in patients with cardiac diseases. In patients with heart failure, heart rate is increased and heart rate variability and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity are decreased. All three changes reflect a relative increase of the sympathetic over the parasympathetic nervous system. The mechanisms underlying this autonomic imbalance are complex and not completely understood. Heart rate variability as a reflection of the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is related to electrical stability of the myocardium. Increased vagal activity is associated with increased heart rate variability and a decrease in the high frequency band in the spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Most clinical studies observed an increase in heart rate and in low to high frequency ratio in the spectral analysis of heart rate variability prior to spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia in patients after myocardial infarction. The latter indicates a decrease in vagal relative to sympathetic tone. Heart rate variability was also shown to be a good and independent predictor of mortality of patients after myocardial infarction. Furthermore, it was observed that heart rate variability is reduced in patients with heart failure within 24 hours before onset of ventricular tachycardia. Whether or not pharmacological agents which influence heart rate and heart rate variability may be associated with altered prognosis is not known yet.
In the Gargellen Conference "Heart rate as a determinant of cardiac function - Basic mechanisms and clinical significance" international experts in this field were brought together to elaborate on the interrelation between heart rate and myocardial function, arrhythmias, prognosis, and therapy of patients with cardiac diseases. Basic mechanisms as well as clinical relevance and therapeutic consequences were critically discussed.

Introduction
This review deals with the neuro-hormonal changes in congestive heart failure, a syndrome that is usually initiated by a reduction of cardiac output. In order to do this, we should like to 1) summarise previous and more recent evidence for a number of these neuro-hormonal derangement's, 2) review the experimental evidence for an abnormality in the function of the arterial- and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflexes and 3) discuss, whether this abnormality or an interaction with renal mechanisms might cause the neuro-hormonal derangements in congestive heart failure.
Evidence for a reduced "vagal tone" in congestive heart failure
Before presenting evidence in favor of a loss of resting "vagal tone" in heart failure, the physiology of the baroreflex and the respiratory influences on cardiac vagal activity need to be briefly reviewed.
Vagal preganglionic neurones innervating the heart (vagal cardiomotor neurones) are predominantly located in the ventrolateral part of the rostral nucleus ambiguus (NA). Baroreceptor influences are probably transmitted to these neurones through projections from the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) to the NA. A species dependent number of vagal preganglionic neurones located in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) have also been described, but little is known whether they differ in function from those neurones in the NA (for references: see 22, 24).
Baroreceptor influence on vagal cardiomotor neurones
Baroreceptor stimulation causes excitation of vagal cardiomotor neurones and bradycardia (70, 98, 105). The central latency of this baroreflex excitation amounts to 20-110 ms only (24). Furthermore, these vagal cardiomotor neurones are more sensitive to the baroreceptor input than sympathetic neurones although they have a higher threshold than the latter (95). Recordings of efferent cardiac vagal activity have shown that in the anaesthetized

Systolic Blood Pressure ( mmHg )

Fig. 1 Relationship between systolic blood pressure and heart beat interval in conscious (our own data) and in anaesthetized dogs (Koch's data). In conscious dogs, blood pressure was either decreased by an i.v. injection of Nitro-glycerine (Nitro; open triangels, open circles) or increased by a bolus injection of Phenylephrine (phen.; filled circles). Nitro-glycerine-experiments: After systolic pressure had dropped to a minimum of 72-94mmHg, systolic pressure and the first heart beat interval to follow were recorded for 30-35 seconds with increasing pressure (ascending). Phenylephrine-experiments: Systolic pressure and the first heart beat interval to follow were recorded for 10 seconds with increasing pressure (ascending). The data were approximated by the power function Y = a + be (r = 0.86). Koch's data: Heart beat interval versus carotid sinus pressure in anaesthetized dogs (right carotid sinus preparation; left sinus nerves and both aortic nerves cut) as reported by Koch (92). The data were approximated by a 4-parameter logistic function (Y = a+b / (X/C)d; r = 0.98). ----: 122 ± 4 (SEM) beats/min: Intrinsic heart rate as evaluated from 11 conscious dogs (see text).

animal these efferents show very little central activity unless blood pressure exceeds 140-150 mmHg (70, 71, 98). In Koch's data, which were also obtained during anaesthesia, heart rate is reduced below the intrinsic heart rate of a dog's sinus node (122 ± 4 beats/min) when systolic blood pressure increases above 125 mmHg (Fig. 1). Both observations may be limited by anaesthesia, which reduces "vagal tone" (see below). In our experiments in conscious dogs, heart rate is reduced below the intrinsic heart rate at a systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg already (Fig. 1). Finally, experiments in which vagal cardiomotor neurones and cardiac sympathetic neurones were stimulated electrically have clearly shown that the response of the vagal neuroeffector junction (sinus node) is much faster (a change may be complete within 3-4 seconds) than the response to sympathetic stimulation (a maximum response may require 25-35 seconds). The "off-response" of the vagal neuroeffector junction is also much fasterthan their sympathetic counterpart (170, 175, 176). This has the important physiological advantage of increasing both heart rate and cardiac output within a few seconds, for instance at the onset of exercise.
Respiratory influences on cardiac vagal activity
Respiratory variations of heart rate were first described by Carl Ludwig in 1847 (for reference see 21). Early workers agreed that the arrhythmia was abolished by division of the

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 3
cervical vagus nerves, thus, providing evidence as to its neural origin. Later work revealed that both central and pulmonary reflex mechanisms were involved and that the efferent pathway is largely vagal in both animals and man (21). Respiratory arrhythmia is quite striking in humans, in conscious and in morphine-chloralose-anaesthetized dogs but is weak or absent in conscious cats, rabbits, and rats. However, even in species normally presenting clear sinus arrhythmia, it is suppressed by various anaesthetic agents with vagolytic properties (21, 62, 70). In chloralose-anaesthetized dogs, central cardiac vagal activity ("vagal tone") is still present after elimination of all afferents running in the vagi, the aortic, and the sinus nerves (92). Central respiratory activity originating from medullary neurones strongly influences vagal cardiomotor discharge, which shows a pattern inverse to sympathetic efferent activity with a maximum occurring during expiration (71, 98, 105). Recording cardiac vagal efferent nerve activity Katona and co-workers (78) showed that respiratory sinus arrhythmia in the spontaneously breathing dog is due to a complete cessation of vagal efferent activity during the inspiratory phase of each respiratory cycle. The presence of this central "vagal tone", i.e., resting activity in the cardiac vagal efferent fibers, is an important prerequisite for the demonstration of respiratory arrhythmia. Iriuchijima and co-workers, also recording the activity of vagal cardiomotor neurones, observed that vagal efferent cardiomotor fibers could only be activated by the baroreceptor input during expiration (71). This is in line with the previous observation that the vagally transmitted bradycardia by electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve was minimal at the early phase of inspiration and maximal at early expiration (94). In man Eckberg and collaborators found that a baroreceptor stimulus by brief neck suction increased the heart beat interval by 30 ms (minimum) during inspiration and by 220 ms (maximum) during early expiration (36).
Dependence of respiratory arrhythmia and baroreflex bradycardia on "vagal tone"
That respiratory sinus arrhythmia increases with an increasing heart beat interval was reported as early as 1935 (147). Consequently, the standard deviation of the heart beat interval, which more recently is used as an index of respiratory arrhythmia, also increases with an increasing baseline heart beat period. The relationship between the respiratory variation in the heart beat interval and baseline heart beat was found to be nearly quadratic (93, 145). This was confirmed by Katona and Jih (79), who found that a linear correlation was less appropriate. In their experiments, the respiratory variations of heart rate period reached a minimum at a heart rate period of around 550 ms (= l20/min), which is close to a dog's intrinsic heart rate (see below). These results clearly suggest that the degree of respiratory sinus arrhythmia may be used as a non-invasive indicator of the degree of prevailing central parasympathetic "vagal tone" (79).
The slope of the relationship between systolic pressure and heart beat interval after the intravenous injection of a vasoconstrictor drug (called "baroreflex sensitivity" according to the "Oxford"-method) is also a function of the baseline heart beat interval (10, 12, 16, 51, 67,161).
Reduced "vagal tone" in heart failure
The tachycardia in patients suffering from heart failure was alreay known to E. Starling (154), but, because of the early recognition of sympathetic overactivity, traditionally was

4 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
assigned to an enhanced cardiac sympathetic tone. Indirect evidence for a reduced resting vagal discharge to the heart was provided by the observation that patients with a diseased myocardium showed a depressed respiratory arrhythmia (145). Calculating an arrhythmiaindex this author also reported that respiratory arrhythmia was dependent on age as well as on the resting heart rate. Using microneurography to record muscle sympathetic nerve discharge in healthy subjects and in patients with heart failure, Porter and collaborators noted a strong central respiratory modulation of sympathetic outflow, but very few signs of changes in vagal outflow, i.e., no respiratory arrhythmia (131). Short baseline R-R intervals and small standard deviations of the R-R interval indicating a decreased level of vagal cardiac nerve activity were also noted in heart failure (2,131,144,151,153). In some of the patients studied by Porter and co-workers the standard deviations of the R-R interval were almost as small as in heart transplant patients (denervated donor, denervated recipient) (3, 144). Smith and collaborators reported that the correction of heart failure by transplantation (denervated donor, innervated recipient) restored the parasympathetic control toward normal (151). More direct evidence for a reduced "vagal tone" in heart failure was provided by Eckberg and co-workers. Patients with coronary heart disease and idiopathic cardiomyopathy experienced the same degree of bradycardia (-9 to -10 beats/min) as control subjects when given propranolol intravenously, but less tachycardia after intravenous atropine sulphate (+34 beat/min versus + IS beats/min). The authors therefore suggested that in patients with heart disease the baseline vagal tone from the central nevous system was diminished (35). Similar data after intravenous application of atropine (10 f.lg/kg) were reported by Porter and co-workers, who observed that heart rate increased to the same level (89-92 beats/min) in both groups of subjects, but started from a lower baseline level (65 beats/min) in the healthy subjects as compared to patients suffering of heart failure (77 beats/min) (131).
Increased sympathetic nerve activity in congestive heart failure
Before presenting evidence in favor of an increased sympathetic nerve discharge to several target organs in heart failure, a few remarks should be made with regard to the origin of resting sympathetic nerve activity.
It is clear now that neurones in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are tonically active and generate a large component of the resting sympathetic activity in anaesthetized animals (for references see 22). A question which still remains unanswered is how this tonic activity in the RVLM neurones is generated. Three different mechanisms have been proposed (for references see 22): 1) One suggestion is that the RVLM sympathetic cells are chemosensitive and are tonically excited even at normal levels of blood pH, p02' and pC02. In support of this theory, the blood flow and capillary density within the RVLM have been shown to be significantly greater than in surrounding areas. 2) Another suggestion is that pacemaker cells in the RVLM are largely responsible for generating resting activity in sympathetic neurones. 3) A third theory suggests than an ensemble of neurones (referred to as "network oscillator") in the brain stem generates a basal level of activity which is then transmitted to the RVLM sympathoexcitatory neurones.

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 5
In many clinical studies plasma noradrenaline has been used as an index for an increased sympatho-adrenal activity in heart failure which should be commented on before discussing the increased sympathetic nerve discharge to different organs.
Plasma levels of noradrenaline are elevated and correlate with the severity ofthe disease in congestive heart failure (18,158). In normal men estimations of total and organ-specific noradrenaline spillover have shown that 25 % of total spillovers have their origin in the kidneys (22 %) and the heart (3 %). The hepatomesenteric circulation (9 %), skeletal muscle (20 %), and skin (5 %) together contribute approximately 34 % of total spillover (43). Studies on the kinetics of plasma noradrenaline in heart failure have shown that cardiac (+540%) and renal (+206 %) noradrenaline spillover are increased (64). It was estimated that the elevated plasma levels were caused by an increased spillover and a reduced clearance, probably due to a reduced muscle and visceral blood flow (64). Increased spillover and reduced clearance contributed equally to the high plasma levels (23). However, a more recent study by Meredith and co-workers suggests that the increased spillover results primarily from an increased sympathetic nerve firing, not from faulty neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline (110). At least in some patients increased levels of adrenaline were also reported (64).
Cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (noradrenaline spillover)
Although there are no direct recordings of cardiac sympathetic nerve discharge in animals with heart failure, there can be little doubt from the analysis of noradrenaline spillover that sympathetic nerve discharge to the heart is enhanced. The reported increases in cardiac noradrenaline spillover of patients in comparison to healthy subjects ranges between + 145 % (99) to +800 % (110), while other authors reported values between these extremes (64,80,81).
Sympathetic nerve acitivity to skeletal muscle
Microneurography of sympathetic action potentials in skin and muscle nerves has contributed considerably to our understanding of the function of the sympathetic nervous system (160, 169). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity provides vasoconstrictor impulses to the resistance vessels of skeletal muscle and is strongly time-locked to the heart beat. In normotensive and hypertensive subjects and in patients with congestive heart failure, the frequency of sympathetic bursts correlated positively with forearm venous plasma noradrenaline concentration (102, 168). The strong pulse-synchronous muscle nerve activity suggests that it is dominanted by the inhibitory influences of arterial baroreceptor afferents. In this context we should like to add a few remarks on the physiology of the inhibition of sympathetic efferents by baroreceptor input, since it is an essential background for the interpretation of several clinical studies suggesting a defect in baroreflex sympathetic inhibition in heart failure.
The central latency of the baroreceptor inhibition of sympathetic neurones as determined in animals ranges from 150-200 ms (24). Electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve in anaesthetized animals produces a reduction in sympathetic activity with a maximum within the first seconds (138, 149). After this early strong inhibition, sympathetic activity returns within 60 seconds to a steady-state level of less pronounced inhibition. Both, the dynamic and the static response increases with increasing stimulus frequencies up to 3040 imp/s and remains constant at higher frequencies. The maximum in the static response

6 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
is reached at frequencies of 20-30 imp/so Interrupted impulse volleys are more effective in sympathetic inhibition (static) than the same number of impulses per time during continuous stimulation (138). The maximum static inhibition can be obtained with a high impulse frequency within a stimulus train of 220 to 500 ms duration and a repitition rate of 1 Hz. This resembles a pattern similar to the one during the pulsatile discharge of the baroreceptors under normal conditions and explains the strongly phasic discharge pattern in baroreceptor controlled sympathetic activity. Applying carotid sinus nerve stimulation this pattern of sympathetic inhibition was also reported in humans by Wallin and co-workers. Conforming observations in animals (24) these authors also found that carotid sinus nerve stimulation had no reproducible effect on skin nerve activity (165).
Muscle nerve activity in man displays large inter-individual variations. A correlation between the blood pressure level and the "tonic level" of muscle sympathetic nerve activity has been demonstrated in essential hypertension, but it should be noted that the relationship is weak (166, 167, 169). Despite the caveats with regard to tonic activity, the microneurographic recordings provide rather good evidence that sympathetic nerve activity to skeletal muscle is higher in patients when compared with normal subjects (48, 57, 102, 131).
Sympathetic nelVe discharge to skin
Sympathetic activity to the skin normally is irregular with no relation to the pressure pulse. Functionally it is composed of vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, and sudomotor activity and is very low in relaxed subjects in a thermoneutral environment. Skin nerve activity as compared with muscle sympathetic nerve activity has a more pronounced respiratory rhythmicity, is barely affected by baroreceptors, and is predominantly engaged in thermoregulatory responses (4, 73, 82, 83, 169). Recent simultaneous recordings of sympathetic skin and muscle nerve activity in 6 resting patients with severe heart failure revealed that in contrast to muscle sympathetic activity skin nerve discharge was not increased (112).
Renal sympathetic nelVe activity
There is good evidence from nerve recordings or renal noradrenaline spillover in animals with congestive heart failure that renal sympathetic nerve activity is increased (28, 29,46, 64,96, 143).
In conscious dogs a moderate reflex activation of the renal sympathetic nerves (+ 62 %) increases the lower limit of renal blood flow- and glomerular filtration rate autoregulation as well as the threshold for pressure-dependent renin release by an aI-adrenergic mechanism (Fig. 5); an augmented angiotensin II formation does not playa major role in mediating this resetting (128). At a constant renal perfusion pressure sympathetic activation causes a direct i31-andrenergic stimulation of renin release. Thus, at least transiently sodium and water retention may be initiated without necessarily inducing an initial major reduction of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (7, 88,90,91, 137, 148). If the degree of renal sympathetic activation in early congestive heart failure, indeed, is only moderate as shown in animals studies (+ 50 %) (46), it would be consistent with the hypothesis that a normal baroreceptor function could initiate these changes in early congestive heart failure (87).

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 7
Honnonal abnonnalities in congestive heart failure
Activation of the renin-angiotensin-system
More than 40 years ago Merrill and co-workers reported an increased renal venous renin activity in patients with congestive heart failure (111). It is known now that the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system plays an essential role in the sodium and water retention and the restoration of cardiac output and arterial blood pressure in congestive heart failure (34, 177). The mechanisms controlling renin release in heart failure have not been well defined in clinical studies, and in the past it seemed particularly difficult to explain the sodium retention in early heart failure when blood pressure, blood volume, and renal blood flow are apparently unchanged. Using inferior vena cava constriction to induce heart failure in dogs, Witty and collaborators (181) proposed that the renal "baroreceptor" mechanism was responsible for the early increase in plasma renin activity. Further, below we will describe the role of the pressure-dependent renin release in blood pressure control and explain how the efferent renal nerves and the renal "baroreceptor" - mechanism may interact in the early renin activation of heart failure.
Increased plasma levels of ANP
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a circulating hormone released by distension of the left and right atrium. Thus, ANP is released by maneuvers, which change intrathoracic blood volume, such as volume loading, head-out water immersion, acute salt load, chronic salt load, change in posture, and inferior vena cava constriction. Any increase of volume in intrathoracic compartment of the low pressure system, which determines the filling of the heart (preload), can be counteracted by the following effects of ANP: 1) an increase of venous compliance, 2) an increase of sodium excretion unrelated to changes in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate, 3) a volume redistribution within the low pressure system away from the heart (130), and 4) an antagonistic action towards the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (for references see 85). However, the latter effect becomes evident only when the renin-angiotensin system is activated. Furthermore, ANP seems to modulate the actions of vasoconstrictor agents rather than having a direct and wholly independent effect on resistance vessels (40, 85). While changes in dietary sodium intake induce a 2-3 fold increase in plasma ANP, very high levels of ANP have been observed in heart failure (8-10 fold). The most prominent function of ANP in congestive heart failure is probably its antagonistic action towards the volume retaining factors (renal sympathetic nerves, angiotensin II, aldosterone, vasopressin; for references see 40, 85). This allows fluid balance to be achieved at an elevated level (compensation). More recent studies provide evidence that ANP secretion does not chronically adapt to stimulation by increased atrial pressure (150), so in congestive heart failure a reduced responsiveness of the kidney to ANP may be a more important factor inducing angoing sodium retention with a shift of the cardiovascular system from a state of compensation to one of decompensation (for references see 180).

8 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
Increased plasma levels of AVP
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) serves osmotic and hemodynamic regulation, and its release is affected by plasma osmolality, blood volume, and blood pressure (140). Small decreases in blood pressure of the order of 5-10 % usually have little effect on plasma vasopressin, whereas decreases in blood pressure of 20-30 % result in hormone levels several times those required to produce maximum antidiuresis. The AVP response to changes in blood volume appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the response to blood pressure. Little or no rise in plasma AVP can be detected until blood volume falls by 6-8 %. Beyond that point, plasma AVP begins to rise at a rapidly increasing rate in relation to the degree of hypovolemia and usually reaches levels 20-30 times normal when blood volume is reduced by 20-30 %.
In patients suffering from heart failure the plasma levels seem to be increased in proportion to the degree of their cardiac disability (185). Since AVP appears to only playa major role in blood pressure control under conditions of cardiovascular stress, including dehydration or hemorrhage (65), it seems possible that its activation during heart failure is directed towards the same goal. Seemingly normal AVP levels found in many heart failure patients are inappropriate for their plasma osmolalities and probably contribute to abnormal sodium and water retention (for references see 37). AVP also has important central actions on sympathetic nerve discharge and renin release.
Endothelial factors, defective nitric oxide-function
An increase in the circulating level of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor released by the endothelium, was also observed in experimental heart failure (107) as well as in patients (19, 155). An apparent decrease in the local release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, or nitric oxide (NO) has been reported in experimental heart failure (76, 124) and in patients (97). In normal rats (142) and rabbits (63) changes in peripheral sympathetic nerve activity have been recorded after systemic inhibition of NO synthesis. A more recent study by Zanziger and co-workers in the normal anaesthetized cat suggests that endogenous NO reduces basal sympathetic tone in the RVLM and attenuates excitatory somato-sympathetic reflex responses (186). The same group of authors provided evidence that sympathetic baroreflex function is preserved during both impaired endogenous synthesis or excess exogenous supply of NO in the brainstem (187). Recording carotid sinus nerve discharge in anaesthetized cats, these authors found that neither abluminal nor intravascular administration of the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA significantly modulated baroreceptor activity (188).
Thus, aside from the influence on basal sympathetic tone, the role of nitric oxide in cardiovascular physiology seems to be largely confined to a peripheral interaction with sympathetic vasomotor tone. The role of endothelin and NO in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure still needs to be established.

Arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor abnormalities
Carotid sinus baroreceplon
Recording single unit carotid sinus baroreceptor discharge in normal dogs and in dogs with pacing-induced congestive heart failure (250 beats/min for 4 weeks), Wang and co-workers observed that threshold pressure (119 versus 91 mmHg) was increased and sensitivity was reduced (max. slope: 0.40 versus 0.63 spikes/s/mmHg). Pressure in the isolated sinus was increased in this study by slow ramp increases (2-3 mmHg/s) from zero to threshold pressure and subsequently in 25 mmHg steps lasting 10-15 s to a maximum of 250 mmHg. By measuring carotid sinus diameter, the authors further provided evidence that the decreased sensitivity was not due to a change in compliance of the carotid sinus wall (171). A similar observation had been reported before in dogs with chronic aortocaval fistulas (high-output heart failure), in which both static and dynamic characteristics of the baroreceptor afferents could be evaluated (119). The same authors more recently investigated the total number of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers in the carotid sinus nerve in dogs with pacing induced heart failure, in which the single unit baroreceptor responses to static and pulsatile pressure changes were markedly depressed. However, there was no evidence for significant changes in the number or type of fibers, indicating that desensitization is a more likely possibility to explain the depressed function than structural changes (174).
Aortic baroreceptors
Similar observations were made for the aortic baroreceptors. Aortic afferent activity was studied in open chest anaesthetized dogs, which were either sham operated or had chronic aortocaval fistulas (120). This high-output heart failure was associated with a reduced baroreceptor sensitivity and a resetting of the operating point to a higher pressure level. The authors also measured aortic diameter and strain and found that the decrease in discharge sensitivity was unrelated to wall strain. Dibner-Dunlap and Thames recorded aortic nerve multifiber activity in anaesthetized sham operated dogs and in dogs with heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing; blood pressure was changed by phenylephrine or nitroglycerine injections. A decrease in sensitivity by 36 % and 52 % (baseline, or after vagotomy) was observed in the heart failure group with a reduction in the range over which aortic nerve activity changed, but no alterations in threshold pressure (25). Further support was supplied recently by DiBona and Sawin, who recorded single fiber aortic nerve activity in anaesthetized normal rats and in rats with congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction. Also changing pressure using vasoactive drugs, they found an increased threshold pressure and a decreased sensitivity (30).
Atrial receptors
Using two different approaches to induce heart failure in dogs, Greenberg and co-workers (pulmonary artery stenosis and tricuspid avulsion) and Zucker and co-workers (chronic infrarenal aortovacal fistulas) showed that atrial type-B receptor discharge sensitivity was clearly depressed (58, 189). In the study by Zucker and co-workers all receptors recorded

10 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
from were located in the left atrium near the pulmonary vein - left atrial junction. Zucker and colleagues also showed that the compliance of the left atria, in which these endings were located, was reduced and that there were histological abnormalities in the unencapsulated endings, which are thought to have the anatomical features of this type of sensory receptor. In rats with congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction DiBona and Sawin als recorded single-unit vagal nerve activity and found that the sensitivity as evaluated from the relationship between left ventricular enddiastolic pressure and vagal activity was depressed. Although the receptors were not localized, the study at least confirms a defect in vagal afferent activity in congestive heart failure (30).
Left ventricular mechanoreceptors
Although there are clinical (116) and experimental observations (8, for further references see 175, 190) suggesting an abnormality of ventricular reflexes in congestive heart failure , no work has been done up to date on the electrophysiological characteristics of ventricular mechanoreceptive and chemoreceptive afferents in any model of congestive heart failure .
Abnormalities in the baroreceptor control of sympathetic nerve activity
Consistent with the abnormalities at the receptor level, reports on experiments studying the relationship between carotid sinus- or systemic blood pressure and renal sympathetic nerve discharge or renal norepinephrine spillover in animals with congestive heart failure reported a decrease in sensitivity in dogs (172), rats (30, 31 , 46), and rabbits (122) . In one study in dogs no change (non-significant 5 %decrease) was observed (25). Using conscious rabbits with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy Sano and co-workers observed that the baroreflex-renal norepinephrine spillover response to hypotension in an early stage of heart failure showed a significant upward shift (resetting), while in established failure there was a significant blunting of the spillover response (decreased sensitivity) (143). In many studies (25, 30, 31, 46, 122, 143) vasoactive drugs were used to change blood pressure. Since under these circumstances changes in cardiac filling pressure cannot be exluded (49, 114), the resetting or the calculated loss of sensitivity cannot be specifically attributed to arterial or cardiopulmonary receptors. In the most controlled experiments by Wang and co-workers, who studied an isolated sinus preparation of one side with all other cardiopulmonary or baroreceptor input removed, the data show that the baroreflex sympathetic inhibition at sinus pressures above 180 mmHg was more attenuated than the reflex sympathetic activation observed below a sinus pressure of 80 mmHg; the slope of the relationship suggested a decrease in the carotid sinus-sympathetic reflex sensitivity by 24 % (172). DiBona and associates used rats with heart failure due to coronary infarction and similar to Wang and co-workers found that the failure to inhibit renal sympathetic nerve discharge was most pronounced at systemic pressures above 150 mmHg and reported decreases in gain between 41 and 49 % (30, 31). Using the same method in rats, Feng and collaborators found a decrease in sensitivity for inhibition of renal sympathetic nerve activity by 30 % between 120 and 160 mmHg (46) . Thus, the receptor abnormalities, at least with regard to the efferent renal nerves, seem to cause an overall attenuation of the reflex sensitivity.

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 11
Three of the studies mentioned above also tested the "central gain" of the baroreceptor reflex in congestive heart failure. Dibner-Dunlap and colleagues used the ratio of the percent change in renal nerve activity to the percent change in aortic nerve activity and found no evidence for a central abnormality (25). This was supported by Wang and associates recording renal sympathetic nerve discharge and electrically stimulating the carotid sinus nerve (172). In the rat with cardiac failure (coronary infarction) DiBona and Sawin, measuring simultaneously afferent vagal nerve activity and efferent renal sympathetic nerve discharge, also found no evidence for a central abnormality (30).
As to the relative inhibitory influence mediated by the arterial as compared to cardiopulmonary receptors in congestive heart failure, it was suggested that in heart failure due to rapid pacing that the cardiopulmonary input is especially impaired (25, 26). In rats with heart failure induced by coronary infarction Feng and co-workers observed no significant change in renal sympathetic nerve discharge during volume expansion (48). DiBona and Sawin (32) observed that increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity after individual or combined sinuaortic denervation or vagotomy were less in cardiac failure (coronary infarction) than in normal control rats in both order sequences. In rats with heart failure vagotomy produced lesser increases in renal sympathetic nerve discharge than sinuaortic denervation in both order sequences. The authors suggested that tonic vagal restraint is always low in cardiac failure.
Finally it should be noted that almost all studies in animals were made under the influence of anaesthesia. The combination of surgical trauma (activation of viscerosomatic afferents) in acutely prepared experimental animals with a chloralose or pentobarbital anesthesia, for example, induces a strong increase of "tonic" renal sympathetic nerve activity, while Alfathesin anesthesia has only little influence (for references see 90). The operating point (resting blood pressure) on the logistic function curve relating renal nerve activity to blood pressure in these animals is located either at the midpoint (maximum sensitivity) or even further up toward a higher resting nerve activity (25, 30, 31, 172). Thus, when applied to the physiological situation, these curves would erroneously suggest equally large degrees of sympathetic activation as well as inhibition. However, in the resting conscious animal, the operating point is non-symmetrically positioned at a low resting sympathetic nerve discharge (Fig. 6), which suggests an entirely different conclusion with regard to integrative control, because it only needs a slight increase in blood pressure to induce a maximum sympathetic inhibition (90). Therefore, the function curves relating sympathetic nerve activity to blood pressure should be looked at very critically, when it comes to deciding whether an abnormality was caused by a change in tonic activity, in range or in sensitivity or whether it was due to a resetting. In a study in man, which used multiunit recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve discharge (49), patients with congestive heart failure showed a higher resting activity at a comparable mean blood pressure level (89 versus 90 mmHg) than the healthy control group (61 versus 32 bursts/min). While the sympathetic inhibition caused by a phenylephrine induced pressure rise (+ 10 mmHg) was identical in both groups, sympathetic activation after nitro-glycerine induced hypotension (-15 mmHg) was attenuated in the heart failure group. Thus, the impaired baroreflex control in this study might well be explained by a resetting of the function curve relating nerve activity to blood pressure toward a higher pressure level.
Effect of glycoside therapy on baroreceptor afferents or their reflexes
With regard to the mechanism responsible for the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor abnormalities, the effects of cardiac glycosides should also be shortly mentioned. It has

12 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
been known for many years that cardiac glycosides posses neuroexcitatory effects (52), most likely by inhibiting Na+-K+-ATPase. Studies in normal animals had suggested that the administration of digitalis or digitalis-like drugs in relatively high doses can sensitize both arterial and cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors (133,156). Wang and co-workers demonstrated that the reduced discharge ofcarotid sinus baroreceptor afferents in dogs with pacing induced congestive heart failure was increased and normalized again when the sinus was perfused with 0.01 /lg/ml ouabain; this effect was not observed in the normal animals (171, 192). Administration of a low dose of digitalis to the isolated carotid sinus in dogs with congestive heart failure also normalized the reduced duration of postexcitatory depression, which is described for other mechanoreceptors and is thought to be due to an increase in Na+-K+-ATPase (172, 192). The same group of authors have reported that aldosterone which augments Na+-K+-ATPase in transporting epithelium, in a low concentration (200500 pg/ml) decreased discharge of single unit baroreceptor afferents in the isolated carotid sinus preparation of normal dogs. The effect was not associated with a change in the carotid sinus pressure-diameter relationship. The inhibitory action could not be reversed by ouabain, but was completely eliminated after removal of the endothelium or the aldosterone receptor blocker spironolactone. The authors suggested that although it remains unclear if aldosterone participates in the depression of baroreceptor discharge in heart failure, sustained hyperaldosteronemia may contribute to the depression of baroreceptor function through an endothelial cell mechanism (172, 192). The cause for the obvious increase in the Na+-K+-ATPase in baroreceptors in heart failure is not known.
There is also some indirect evidence in man supporting the effects of low doses of ouabain on the carotid sinus afferents; Ferguson and co-workers demonstrated that muscle sympathetic activity recorded by peroneal nerve microneurography could be reduced in patients with heart failure by the intravenous administration of a rapidly acting digitalis preparation, which was accompanied by an increased systolic (+ 16 %) and pulse pressure (+41 %), no change in mean pressure, an increase of cardiac output (+21 %), and a 28 % increase of forearm blood flow. No inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity was reported after administration of equal inotropic doses of dobutamine, which caused no change in systolic and diastolic pressure and increased cardiac output by 34 % which suggested to the authors that the sympathetic inhibition was not due to the improvement of cardiac function. However, this conclusion is weakened by the fact that after dobutamine there were no changes of systolic blood pressure, a variable which normally is responsible for considerable phasic baroreceptor inhibition. In normal volunteers, the digitalis preparation did not change sympathetic nerve activity, while it increased systolic (+ 12 %), pulse(+24 %), and mean pressure (+5 %; there was no change in forearm blood flow. The authors suggested that the effects in the patients result from afferent activation of low or high pressure baroreceptors (48). In a later study the same group of authors reported an enhanced reflex increase of sympathetic nerve activity due to low level LBNP (up to -15 mmHg) after the application of the same drug in healthy volunteers and suggested that digitalis selectively augments cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic activity (146). The salient point in this conclusion is that at -15 mmHg LBNP the sympathetic activity (bursts/min) was similar in the control and the digitalis group, but started from a lower level after the drug, which reduced baseline resting sympathetic nerve discharge in these healthy volunteers. Altogether it remains questionable, whether the action of digitalis in man is specifically normalizing the reduced activity of baroreceptor afferents in congestive heart failure. There are several possible sites of action for digitalis.

The baroreceptor heart rate reflex
In heart failure a reduced heart rate response, especially to an increase in blood pressure, has been observed early in patients (35) and in conscious dogs with heart failure produced by tricuspid avulsion and pulmonary stenosis (67). Eckberg and associates in 1971 already had suggested that "a diminished outflow of parasympathetic nerve impulses from the central nervous system" (see above: "reduced vagal tone in heart failure") might be the mechanism for this abnormality. In a host of studies to follow, however, the interpretation of the results obtained with the rather simle "Oxford" method (see above: "Dependence of Respiratory Arrhythmia and Baroreflex Bradycardia on "Vagal Tone") mainly produced the unproven but popular notion of a decreased "baroreflex sensitivity". Therefore, in the section to follow we want to critically analyse the "Oxford" method in order to find out, whether there is unequivocal evidence for a decrease in heart rate "reflex sensitivity".
The finding that heart rate varies inversely with acute changes in arterial pressure has been appreciated since the experiments of Etienne-Jules Marey (106). "Baroreflex sensitivity" is inferred from the slope of the relationship between systolic blood pressure and the first or second heart beat interval to follow of a blood pressure elevation (first 15 seconds usually) produced by an injection of phenylephrine. In a similar fashion the systolic blood pressure - pulse interval relationship was analysed for the response to hypotension, i.e., following an injection of nitro-glycerine. Since systolic pressure is an excellent indicator of the baroreceptor stimulus (for references see 83), there is indeed some logic to use it as an independent variable.
Especially in many human studies only small pressure perturbations of systolic pressure were induced. Consequently relatively short curve-segments were analyzed which were easily fitted by a linear regression. This holds true for experiments in normal man (12, 35), .in patients with heart failure (35), in normal animals, and in those with experimentally induced congestive heart failure (10, 16, 17, 67, 178). A "baroreflex sensitivity" was estimated either for only the bradycardia response due to hypertension (J 2,35,67) or for both, the tachycardia response due to hypotension, and the bradycardia response due to hypertension (10, 16, 17, 178). Probably because of the difficulty to obtain a satisfactory linear curve-fit when anazlyzing a larger pressure range (tachycardia and bradycardia response in one and the same relationship), the responses were regularly plotted in two separate graphs. The "baroreflex sensitivity" analyzed for the bradycardia response in normal dogs was always found to be larger than for the tachycardia response, so a "baroreflex sensitivity" was reported, which was 2-3 fold higher for the response to hypertension when compared with the response to hypotension (10, 16, 17). White, also working with dogs, reported an even larger difference (8-fold) (178). In this study for example one curve was plotted for the phenylephrine and a second one for the glyceryl trinitrate response in one and the same dog (dog # 256; Fig. 1). A close look at these data obviously shows that one common curve could have been plotted, which, however, would show a non-linear relationship with a high slope in the low heart rate range and a very flat slope in the high heart rate range (178).
So, in essence all these findings simply support the experiments by Koepchen and Thurau (93), who observed that over a large range of pressures the relationship between systolic blood pressure and heart beat interval in anaesthetized dogs is non-linear. A similar result had been already observed by Koch (92) who plotted heart beat interval as a function of mean carotid sinus pressure (Fig. I). In the careful study by Koepchen and Thurau (93) this relationship at intervals between 456 and 333 ms (132-180 beats/min) was rather flat with a slope which was only 116 of the slope above intervals of 500 ms (120 beats/min). In

14 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
its steep portion (high "baroretlex sensitivity") above 500 ms the curve was shifted along the pressure axis by the respiratory phase, i.e., during mid-end inspiration (decreased efferent vagal activity) to the right, and at end-expiration(increased efferent vagal activity) to the left (see Fig. 10 of that study). A non-linearity between heart rate and carotid sinus transmural pressure has also been reported by Thron and co-workers (159) and Wagner and co-workers (164) when they studied the heart rate retlex in normal humans subjects. The highest baroretlex slope was found with decreasing transmural pressure in a range of heart beat intervals between 632 ms (95/min) and 800 ms (n/min).
Our own data (Fig. 1) obtained in conscious dogs also show one non-linear relationship for both drug injections (phenylephrine and nitro-glycerine), demonstrating a rather tlat curve above 122 beats/min and a steep rise below this value. This is the "intrinsic" or "autonomic" rate of a dog's sinus node which was determined in 11 conscious dogs between the 2nd and 3rd hour after inducing a ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium: 5 mg/kg i.v. +5 mg/kg/min infusion). The result corresponds to the data reported by others: Rigel and co-workers (139) observed 126 ± 6 beats/min in conscious dogs (after [3-blockade), when the "excess tachycardia" observed after Atropin sulphate (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) was abolished by additional vagal nerve cooling. Versteeg and collaborators reported a resting heart rate of 123 ± 3 beats/min in 7 cardiac denervated conscious dogs (162).
Although there is probably a range of some overlap between sympathetic and vagal intluences on the sinus node around 122 beats/min, it is obvious that the steep portion of the systolic blood pressure - pulse interval relationship below 122 beats/min is dominated by vagal efferent activity, while the rather tlat portion above 122 beats/min is mainly due to an elevated sympathetic efferent activity. Studying the effects of drugs acting on the peripheral vascular bed in anaesthetized or conscious dogs and in humans Glick and Braunwald (53) observed already that when arterial pressure rises above control, the decrease in heart rate was mediated by vagal efferents, withdrawal of sympathetic activity playing no detectable role. In healthy subjects the bradycardia due to the i. v. injection of phenylephrine remained unchange.d after cardiac sympathetic blockade by thoracic epidural anaesthesia, while the tachycardia due to nitro-glycerine i.v. was significantly attenuated (55). This is also consistent with the fact that Koch's data only differ from our results (unanaesthetized dogs) in the range above 122 beats/min (Fig. I), which may be explained by the well known vagolytic properties of anaesthesia.
Altogether the studies in dogs with experimental congestive heart failure present unequivocal evidence for a defect in the vagal component of the baroreceptor heart rate retlex, i.e., the linearized slope of the systolic blood pressure - pulse interval relationship below 122 beats/min or above a systolic pressure of 110-120 mmHg (phenylephrine) is reduced by 30 % to 95 % (10, 16, 17, 67, 178). This is consistent with the observation of a reduced "vagal tone" in patients with congestive heart failure and is supported by Sopher and collaborators (153), who used a baroreceptor stimulus by brief (5 s) neck suction in heart failure patients and in healthy subjects in order to induce a retlex change in the R-R interval. The peak response in the R-R interval was smaller in patients suffering from heart failure than in the healthy subjects (+ 95 versus + 178 ms). The baseline R-R interval during normal breathing was 1006 ms in healthy subjects and 866 ms in patients with heart failure; the standard deviation of the R-R interval was significantly smaller in patients with heart failure. The authors suggested that the baroretlex malfunction in heart failure is predicted by low baseline levels of vagal cardiac outtlow.
In heart failure the linearized heart beat interval-systolic pressure relationship was also evaluated separately for the tachycardia response to nitroglycerine only (see:"The baroreceptor-heart rate retlex") and this slope was also reported to be reduced. However, the reported absolute reduction in slope was usually very slight (10, 16, 17, 178) and much less

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 15
convincing than the slope reduction reported for the bradycardia due to a phenylephrine injection. This is easily explained by the fact that the slope after nitroglycerine in the normal dogs was determined for intervals between 536 and 730 ms (resting heart rate: 11282 beats/min), while the slope in dogs with heart failure was determined in the range below 454 ms (resting heart rate: above 132 beats/min) (Fig. 1). In a study by Dibner-Dunlap and Thames (25), who used cardiac pacing to induce heart failure in morphin- a-chloraloseanaesthetized dogs (which preserves cardiac ''vagal tone"), it was observed that the baroreflex change of R-R interval was only attenuated when assessed by blood pressure elevation, but not by reduction. Consequently these authors concluded that there was an abnormal parasympathetic but a preserved cardiac sympathetic control of heart rate. Altogether the studies which evaluated both the tachycardia due to hypotension (nitroglycerine) and the bradycardia due to hypertension (phenylephrine) provide no unequivocal evidence for a defect in the sympathetic component of the baroreceptor heart rate reflex.
In Fig. 2 we have used the data of a number of publications and plotted the slope of the systolic blood pressure - pulse interval relationship ("baroreflex sensitivity") as a function of baseline heart rate. The graph shows that in the healthy animal as well as in congestive heart failure "baroreflex sensitivity" is reduced whenever heart rate increases, particularly at a heart rate between 50 and 120 beats/min, which is dominated by the vagal efferents to the sinus node. Of note, the data by Bristow and collaborators, who reported a decrease in the "baroreflex slope" in man with increasing loads of exercise (heart rate reached 150 beats/min) would also fit into this graph (12).

With regard to the mechanism of the reduced baroreflex bradycardia two further studies need to be shortly mentioned here: Higgins and co-workers showed in dogs that the impaired baroreflex bradycardia in heart failure was not associated with an efferent or an end-organ defect, since the sinuatrial node in these dogs reacted normally to direct electrical vagal stimulation (68). Ellenbogen and co-workers (42) demonstrated normal slowing of the native sinus node during pharmacologically induced increases of arterial pressure in heart transplant recipients (donor denervated, recipient innervated) who had advanced heart failure before transplantation.
In summary there is unequivocal experimental evidence that congestive heart failure is associated with an impairment of the vagally mediated baroreflex bradycardia, while the evidence for a similar defect in the baroreflex sympathetic tachycardia is not convincing at all. The low resting discharge rate of vagal cardiomotor neurones at a normal systolic blood pressure level or above seems to be the dominating factor causing this abnormality. In contrast to the often repeated and unfortunately still very popular notion of a reduced "baroreflex sensitivity", these studies by no means prove that the activating afferent baroreceptor input to vagal and sympathetic cardiomotor neurones is impaired in a sense which would grant this generalized conclusion. To our knowledge the relationship between afferent baroreceptor activity and vagal or sympathetic cardiomotor efferent discharge has not been compared yet between normals and animals with congestive heart failure . It is interesting to note in this context that chemically activated cardiac reflexes (bradycardia due to intracoronary injections of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.4 )lg/kg Veratridine) in conscious dogs with pacing induced heart failure are enhanced rather than attenuated (17); in sinuaortic denervated dogs with the same form of heart failure this was also observed after intracoronary injections of prostacyclin (PGI2) (8). This is consistent again with a low resting vagal activity in heart failure .
Abnormalities in the baroreceptor control
of vasomotor responses
Only a few authors have studied the baroreflex control of peripheral resistance in animals with congestive heart failure . In an often cited early study by Higgins and collaborators (67) in conscious dogs with heart failure (tricuspid avulsion and progressive pulmonary stenosis), it was observed that the increase in blood pressure in response to bilateral carotid occlusion as well as the increase in mesenteric and renal vascular resistance was smaller than in normal dogs. It was concluded that the regional circulatory adjustments to baroreceptor unloading were attenuated by congestive heart failure. For the following reasons this conclusion is not tenable: the smaller pressure response in the dogs with heart failure (+ 26 versus + 52 mmHg) was paralleled by a smaller increase in heart rate also (88 to 119 versus 125 to 138 beats/min), while mesenteric and renal blood flow were not changed. Thus it cannot be excluded that the reduced vagal restraint in the heart failure dogs probably also reduced the increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Consequently the calculated increase in renal and mesenteric vascular resistance was larger in the normal

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 17
dogs, which showed a larger pressure rise, and this probably was mediated by autoregulation ofblood flow. This is consistent with a more recent investigation in conscious dogs with pacing induced heart failure, in which the authors analyzed the open-loop relationships between carotid sinus pressure and blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance (123). It was shown that heart failure depressed baroreflex control of blood pressure through a concurrent reduction in the reflex control of heart rate and cardiac output, whereas the reflex control of vascular resistance was not consistently affected. A normal reaction in hindlimb vascular resistance to a phenylephrine-induced increase or a nitroglycerine-induced fall in blood pressure in anaesthetized dogs with pacing-induced congestive heart failure was also shown by Wilson and co-workers (179). Thus, there is no good evidence for an attenuated vasomotor response due to baroreceptor unloading in heart failure.
Studies in man have been concerned with the effects of orthostasis, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) or blood loss on forearm, splanchnic, and renal blood flow in congestive heart failure.
Before discussing these interventions in patients with congestive heart failure, a peculiarity in normal man as compared to dog should be mentioned: for the cardiopulmonary reflexes, which in man may be rather selectively inactivated by graded LBNP (up to -20 mmHg: no or little effect on aortic pulse pressure, mean pressure, dP/dt, and heart rate), not only the splanchnic vascular bed and renal sympathetic nerves but, contrary to animals, also the muscle (forearm) vascular bed seems to be a major target organ (1, 74; for further references see 141). For the kidney the effects of an enhanced sympathetic nerve discharge (unloading of cardiopulmonary receptors) on renin release and sodium reabsorption have to be quantitatively dissociated from vasomotor effects. In animals and probably also in man it needs a comparatively stronger activation of the renal nerves, i.e., by the simultaneous unloading of the arterial baroreceptors, in order to induce renal vasomotor effects. Larger changes in LBNP (-20 to -45 mmHg), which also affect carotid sinus and aortic baroreceptors in man, induce reflex vasomotor changes of a similar magnitude as orthostasis induced by 90° head up tilt. Thus, in normal man a low level ofLBNP (-20 mmHg) induces decreases in splanchnic blood flow by 10 to 15 %, a slight increase in plasma renin activity (PRA), an increase of muscle sympathetic nerve discharge (for references see 141) and a reduction in forearm blood flow in the range of -20 to -30 % (47, 69). A similar reduction in forearm blood flow (-21 %) with only a -7 % fall in renal blood flow (positron emission tomography) was reported in normal subjects after a blood loss of 450 ml, which did not change heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (113). Reductions in renal and splanchnic blood flow (around-l0 %) in normal man are usually not observed until more negative values of LBNP are attained, which also affect sinoaortic baroreceptor afferents (-20 to -40 mmHg) (69). In normal man the largest changes in renal (-11 % to -30 %) and hepatic plasma flow (-14 % to - 39 %) were reported during orthostasis (103,141).
In patients with congestive heart failure there is evidence for a reduced baseline blood flow to several regions: blood flow to the forearm is reduced by 25 % - 56 % (47, 56, 113, 115), to the calf by 44 % (184), to the liver by 36 % (103), and to the kidney by 41 to 44 % (103, 113) in spite of little changes (a few mmHg) in mean arterial blood pressure. In patients with congestive heart failure the renal blood flow response due to low level LBNP and due to blood loss (-450 ml) is either normal (18) or slightly enhanced (-12.5 % versus -7 %) (113). The response in splanchnic blood flow to low level LBNP is also normal in patients with congestive heart failure (20). Orthostasis or high level LBNP also induced similar renal and mesenteric or hepatic blood flow responses in patients as compared with the healthy control group (20, 103). Although due to the methods in human studies the evidence is rather indirect with regard to the differentiation between the cardiopulmonary

18 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
or the arterial baroreflex, it can be concluded that in man also there is no evidence for a defect in the baro- or cardiopulmonary reflex renal or splanchnic vasomotor response in congestive heart failure.
With regard to the reaction of forearm blood flow to head-up tilt, it is known that patients with congestive heart failure respond with a paradox vasodilatation instead of showing a vasoconstriction (II). This has been confirmed by a number of studies using blood loss, orthostasis or low and high level of LBNP. No change or a slight increase (+5 %) of forearm blood flow was reported (20, 47, 56, 113, 115). A paradox vasodilatation during orthostasis was also observed in man in calf subcutaneous blood flow representing blood flow to muscle (182 183, 184). This group of authors recently reported that the abnormal reflex dilatation in calf subcutaneous flow is normalized to a vasoconstriction after cardiac transplantation (parts of the posterior atrial wall of the recipient remains intact) (184).
The reason behind this abnormal response of muscle blood flow in the extremities in congestive heart failure in man is unclear, but one of the more recent hypothesis shall be mentioned: a part of the vasoconstriction observed in subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle during orthostasis depends on a local "veno-arteriolar reflex" (66) which may be blocked by local anaesthesia, an a-antagonist, or by external counterpressure to reduce venous transmural pressure (for references see 141). In patients with congestive heart failure this "local reflex" seems to be still intact (182, 184). However, when the baroreceptor and this "local reflex" are activated simultaneously in patients, the local mechanism was unable to prevent the paradoxical vasodilatation, which was suggested to be a central nervous system mediated j3-adrenergic vasodilator reflex, since it was abolished by proximal nerve block and 10calj3-receptor blockade (77).
Interaction between the arterialand cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflexes and hormonal control in congestive heart failure
Altogether congestive heart failure is associated with an abnormality in the receptor transduction process of the carotid sinus- and aortic baroreceptors probably unrelated to possible changes in the mechanical properties of the vessel wall. The afferent activity from the low pressure system of the circulation is even more depressed, probably, because in addition the mechanical compliance of the receptor-carrying structures are affected (see "Arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor abnormalities") which may be responsible for the associated histological defects at the receptor endings (atria). This obviously is due to the chronic volume overload. In part these changes may explain the decreased sensitivity between receptor stimulation and reflex sympathetic inhibition. The repeatedly observed failure to further increase sympathetic nerve activity with unloading of the receptors suggests that other factors than receptor defects in addition disturb the tonic regulation of sympathetic nerve discharge. This is also supported by the fact that there is an early defect in the tonic vagal discharge to the heart (see "Evidence for a reduced vagal tone in congestive heart failure"). Up to now there has been little evidence for a decrease in the central gain of the arterial- or cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex . In contrast to the result-

ing abnonnality in the rapidly acting neural control of cardiac output with reduced receptor activation, the baroreflex control of vasomotor tone in the kidney, and the mesenteric circulation seems largely unaffected. An exception seems to be the unexplained peculiar behavior of skeletal muscle vascular tone in man (see "Abnonnalities in the baroreceptor control of vasomotor responses"). The largely intact reflex increase in renal and mesenteric vascular resistance points to a possible involvement of tonically acting honnonal vasomotor influences in congestive heart failure. So altogether it remains questionable, whether there is any causal relationship between these abnormalities in the cardiovascular reflexes and the neuro-honnonal changes observed in congestive heart failure. An interesting experiment with regard to a possible causal relationship between abnonnalities in the cardiovascular reflexes and the neur-hormonal changes should be mentioned (9). The authors looked for the changes in plasma norepinephrine in chronically sinuaortic denervated dogs in which heart failure was induced by rapid pacing. They found that without sinuaortic receptors there was still a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine (Fig. 3). Unfortunately this does not exclude that a possible defect in the remaining cardiopulmonary receptors was responsible for the increase in plasma noradrenaline in heart failure.
Next we will summarize some previous and more recent evidence from animal experiments with some supporting observations in man, which suggest that the kidney via angiotensin II and its action in the central nervous system may determine the tonic level of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve discharge and cause a resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes.

20 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
Central effects of angiotensin II
It is generally accepted thatAng II-induced chronic hypertension is not mediated via a direct action of Ang II on vascular smooth muscle, rather than it appears that this type of hypertension requires time (hours to days) to develop and involves a central mechanism (134, 136). There is also an abundance of evidence suggesting that Ang II acts in the central nervous system to decrease vagal motor activity to the heart and to increase the level of activation of the sympathetic nervous system (6,14,15,72,75,100,104,121,132,135).
Several authors have reported that an intravenous infusion of Ang II in anaesthetized animals reduces the slope of the relationship between mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (15, 60, 101). Other studies using conscious dogs or rabbits have failed to observe an alteration in slope, but have suggested a resetting toward a higher blood pressure (13, 109, 135). In part this difference may be related to the dose of Ang II and different species (6). In spite of the latter inconsistencies there is general agreement that Ang II resets the heart rate reflex towards higher pressures, which was prevented in rabbits by lesioning the area postrema. This suggests that the resetting of cardiac baroreflex by Ang II involved an action at the are postrema (108).
In contrast to the acute resetting of the baroreceptor heart rate reflex, the resetting of the baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity by Ang II has been shown to be a chronic effect. In reviewing the recent literature Bishop and co-workers (6) stated: "Acute administration of Ang II has a direct vasoconstrictor action to increase arterial pressure, which initiates a baroreflex response to inhibit sympathetic nerve activity. At that point in time, ganglionic blockade has little effect on the pressor response. Subsequently, as the arterial baroreflex resets toward higher pressures, sympathetic nerve activity increases back towards the control level. Now ganglionic blockade causes a greater fall in arterial pressure, suggesting a neurogenic mechanism." In support of the central origin of this mechanism it has been found that Ang II-induced hypertension in the rat and in the rabbit was prevented by ablation of the area postrema (for references see 6). Whether the tonic sympathetic nerve discharge of a conscious normotensive animal at rest may be influenced by the intravenous application of a converting enzyme inhibitor is not yet clear. While Noshiro and co-workers reported no change in the renal norepinephrine spillover in the conscious rabbit after enalapril (121), Zucker and calloborators after captopril observed a 26 % decrease in resting renal sympathetic nerve discharge in the conscious dog although mean arterial pressure decreased by 7 mmHg (191 ). In conclusion there is evidence that by a central action Ang II reduces tonic vagal discharge to the heart, acutely resets the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex towards a higher pressure level, and with some latency (-1-1.5 hours) causes the same resetting of the baroreceptor-sympathetic nerve activity reflex (6).
Pressure-dependent renin release as a blood pressure stabilizing system
Regarding the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure in principle only three mechanisms of renin release need to be considered:
Pressure-dependent renin release ("renal baroreceptor") is a mechanism located in the renal vasculature itself and, therefore, is also tightly coupled to renal autoregulation.
The renal sympathetic nerves may influence renin release via two different mechanism.
Their activity can either directly influence the innervated juxtaglomerular cells via a 13 1-
adrenergic pathway or they can modulate pressure-dependent renin release by an aI-adren-
ergic vasomotor mechanism. The 13 I-adrenergic pathway can, of course, also be activated
by circulating epinephrine. The neural ai-adrenergic resetting occurs in both, pressure-

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 21
dependent renin release and in autoregulation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The resetting in autoregulation documents itself in a shift of the lower limits towards a higher blood pressure level (for references see 88, 89). This hemodynamic sympathetic resetting is obviously little affected by a possible secondary formation of angiotensin II (128). Altogether these observations support the coupling between autoregulation and pressure-dependent renin release. It seems likely that the ai-adrenergic vasoconstriction of the larger preglomerular resistance vessels is resetting pressure-dependent renin release and autoregulation by affecting the myogenic response of the preglomerular vessels located more downstream towards the glomerulum (39, 61, 87, 88, 90, 91, 128).
A low sodium diet or the administration ofa converting enzyme inhibitor has been shown to increase only the steep slope of the curve describing pressure-dependent renin release (44,45).
Autoregulation of renal blood flow and pressure-dependent renin release as observed in a resting conscious dog is depicted in Fig. 4. This stimulus-response curve reveals a characteristic pattern: a flat section or plateau in the high pressure range and a very steep section in the low pressure range. When this stimUlus-response curve is approximated by two straight lines, a threshold pressure (Pth) may be easily defined. The average threshold pressure in these 8 conscious dogs was 91 mmHg and the increase in renin release occurs without major alterations of renal blood flow (Fig. 4). Previous experiments conducted by other authors in anaesthetized dogs and our own data obtained in conscious dogs provide unequivocal evidence that the maximum of pressure-dependent renin release coincides very accurately with the lower limit of renal blood flow autoregulation (60-70 mmHg). Below

Threshold pressure (P'h) of pressure dependent renin release was approximated by two linear regression lines. Note that below P'h renin release was doubled for a fall of blood pressure by 2.6 mmHg [Data redrawn from (38)]

this pressure range a further increase of renin release is not observed (41,50). The very high sensitivity of this mechanism is indicated by the fact that below threshold it needs a pressure
drop of 2-3 mmHg only to double renin release (Fig. 4). The direct 131-adrenergic modular
effect on renin release is much less effective. It may slightly increase the slope of the curve below threshold (89) and elevates the suprathreshold plateau level only moderately when renal perfusion pressure is kept constant (59). Up to now we have determined the threshold pressure in 135 experiments conducted in 35 individual foxhounds and have observed that it was rather stable over time in the individual dog but varied between the dogs from 82 to 106 mmHg (average: 92.2 ± 1 mmHg). For averaging purposes we have selected 7 conscious dogs with individual threshold pressures between 96 and 99 mmHg and fitted the plot by a four parameter logistic dose-response curve (Fig. 5). The normal operating point on this curve, i.e., the resting blood pressure was 110 mmHg and, thus, only 12 mmHg above threshold. In a previous study in 14 conscious dogs the difference between long-term mean arterial blood pressure and threshold pressure on average was 12.5 mmHg (38). Since the lower limit of autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (84 mmHg) is significantly higher when compared to renal blood flow autoregulation (67 mmHg) (86), threshold pressure for pressure-dependent renin release is very close to the pressure level below which glomerular filtration rate begins to fall. The ai-adrenergic resetting of threshold pressure by a moderate activation of the renal sympathetic nerves, which did not change renal blood flow significantly, is also depicted in Fig. 5 (39, 61, 84, 87, 88, 90, 128).
Comparing the stimulus-response curve for pressure-dependent renin release (Fig. 5) with the arterial- and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor characteristic relating sympathetic nerve discharge to mean arterial blood pressure (Fig. 6), it becomes evident that in a normal

conscious animal at rest the location of both operating points suggests that a normal resting blood pressure is associated with a low tonic sympathetic nerve discharge (Fig. 6) and a minimum renin release (Fig. 5), constituting two systems, which obviously protect the body only against a fall in blood pressure. At the same time the highest capillary pressure (45-50 mmHg) in the cardiovascular system, i.e., glomerular capillary pressure, is protected from decreasing below a level, which would compromise renal function. Furthermore it is easily conceived that due to the ai-adrenergic threshold shift the effect of even a slight fall of arterial blood pressure on renin release will be potentiated by the concomitant baroreftex increase in sympathetic nerve discharge (Fig. 5).
An important role of pressure-dependent renin release in the medium-term (1-4 hours) blood pressure control has been proposed in a previous study from our laboratory (38). A close correlation between mean arterial blood pressure and threshold pressure was found. Hence, the prevailing blood pressure may depend on the variables which describe pressuredependent renin release, i.e., slope and threshold pressure. A causal relationship between mean arterial blood pressure and this renin release has been proposed, involving the following mechanism: the prevailing mean arterial blood pressure is usually above threshold pressure. However, for about 15 % of the time mean arterial pressure falls below this threshold due to the endogenous variability of blood pressure. These episodes oflow mean arterial blood pressure induce renin release, which in tum increase blood pressure (38).
In a later study we have provided direct evidence for the function of this feedback mechanism under physiological closed-loop conditions. A feedback device was developed (117) which allowed us to maintain a constant pressure difference between systemic and renal artery pressure. Both kidneys were, thus, subjected to a pressure reduction without decreasing systemic mean arterial blood pressure. In this way our method constituted a closed-loop

24 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
preparation in which any subsequent increase in systemic blood pressure also induced the same increase in renal perfusion pressure. Hence, it was possible to quantify directly the exact amount of compensation by the kidney, i.e., the closed-loop gain of this control system in conscious dogs. Using converting-enzyme inhibition, we could quantify the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to this compensation (129).
The major results of this study are depicted in Fig. 7. In A it is demonstrated that in a time control of 6 dogs there was no clear trend in blood pressure. In Band C the effects of

servo-control of a 20 mmHg pressure difference between systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion pressure in 6 dogs are depicted. During the last 30 minutes of servo-controlling the pressure-difference, a new steady state was obtained in all six dogs. Plasma renin activity increased immediately and decreased again during the rising phase of blood pressure. The closed-loop gain was 0.63 i.e., 63 % of the 20 mmHg error signal was compensated for. In D the same experiment was conducted in six dogs during converting enzyme inhibition; from this protocol a closed-loop gain of 0.15 was calculated. It can be concluded from these experiments that the kidneys play an important role in the mediumterm blood pressure control, most probably via the renin-angiotensin system. In these experiments two until now unexplained observations are interesting to note: 1) although plasma renin activity increased immediately as renal perfusion pressure was reduced below threshold, it took roughly I hour after blood pressure started to rise. 2) Although renal perfusion pressure was compensated for by 63 %, plasma renin activity did not return to its initial value during the steady state.
We should like to put forward the following hypothesis to explain these observations: 1) the pressor effect of the angiotensin II formed immediately after the reduction of renal perfusion pressure is initially compensated for by a reflex sympathetic inhibition due to the normal function of the arterial and cardiopulmonary reflexes. Subsequently the slow central action of angiotensin II at the area postrema after approximately 1 hour (see above: "central effects ofAng II") starts to reset the arterial and cardiopulmonary reflexes towards a higher pressure level, readjusting a normal sympathetic nerve discharge to a higher blood pressure level (see Fig. 6). 2) Depending on the exact location of the operating point (Fig. 6), the amount of this readjustment of sympathetic nerve discharge may not be complete, so there might be a remaining nervous resetting of pressure-dependent renin release with a slightly elevated plasma renin level during the new steady state. This hypothesis is consistent with the known central actions of angiotensin II but of course siill needs experimental verification.
There can be no doubt that plasma renin activity rises early in congestive heart failure (for references see 118). According to the experimental data described in the last section, this early increase in plasma renin activity has to be considered a normal physiological response. Even a slight decrease in stroke volume will be noted by the high dynamic sensitivity of the arterial baroreceptors via the changes in aortic dP/dt, systolic pressure, and pulse pressure (83) resulting in a moderate increase in renal sympathetic nerve discharge. Thus, even without any change in aortic mean blood pressure renin release will be activated due to the increase of threshold pressure (Fig. 5). Consequently early renal denervation in the thoracic caval constriction model of congestive heart failure can decrease plasma renin activity by 50 % (181). This stimulatory influence of the renal nerves will be potentiated when accompanied by a fall in mean arterial blood pressure (Fig. 5). The selective chronic reduction of renal perfusion per se to 75-80 % of control, which in conscious dogs has no effect on glomerular filtration rate, is sufficient to initiate sodium and water retention and increase total body sodium within 24 hours. This sodium and volume retention by the way will go on unlimited for days, when the normally occurring downregulation of Ang II and Aldosterone, which brings back the animals into sodium balance, is prevented by infusing these hormones (7, 137, 148). The increase in extracellular fluid volume, of course, via the Frank-Starling mechanism may improve cardiac function (compensation). As long as the low pressure system receptors are functioning their potent inhibitory action on the renal sympathetic nerves will bring back threshold pressure and, thus, renin release to normal. The downregulation ofAng II and Aldosterone, which was described above, may also contribute to compensation. Thus, even severe cardiac dysfunction with an extensive elevation of total body sodium and water may be associated with a completely normal

26 H. R. Kirchheim et al.
plasma renin activity. The importance of blood pressure as a major stimulus for the activation of the renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure was demonstrated by Dzau and co-worker; in three groups of patients with similar reductions in cardiac output and comparable elevations in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure plasma renin activity was inversely correlated with mean arterial blood pressure. A normal plasma renin activity was only found in one of the groups, in which mean arterial blood pressure had reached a normal level, even though evidence for severe cardiac dysfunction still persisted (33).
Actions of angiotensin II in congestive heart failure
As already mentioned there is a reduced "vagal tone" in congestive heart failure, and there is convicing evidence that in normal animals angiotentin II via an action at the area postrema causes withdrawal of "vagal tone". Thus, the reduced "vagel tone" observed in congestive heart failure may very well at least in part be caused by a central action of angiotensin II. There is circumstantial evidence from clinical studies to support this suggestion; studying the reflex bradycardia in patients with the neck-suction technique Vogt and co-workers reported an enhanced response 24 hours after the application of converting enzyme inhibitor (163). Osterziel and co-workers, recognizing that the amount of reflex bradycardia ("Baroreflex sensitivity") due to neck-suction was an indicator of "vagal tone", observed that the reflex bradycardia in patients with congestive heart failure was inversely correlated with plasma renin activity (126). Furthermore they noted that converting enzyme inhibition increased "vagal tone" significantly in congestive heart failure (125, 127). A decrease in the high frequency component of heart rate variability, which was taken to indicate an augmentation of "vagal tone", was also found after therapy with a converting enzyme inhibitor in patients of congestive heart failure (5).
There is some indirect and some direct evidence in the most recent literature to support the hypothesis that in congestive heart failure there is an abnormality of arterial- and cardiopulmonary reflexes, which is caused by a central action of angiotensin II.
In conscious rabbits with cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin Noshiro and associates observed that the blunted mean arterial pressure-renal norepinephrine spillover relationship as well as the blunted relationship between mean arterial pressure and total norepinephrine spillover was returned close to normal after intravenous converting enzyme inhibition. The authors suggested that the renin-angiotensin system contributes significantly to the attenuated baroreflex response in heart failure (122). Using vasomotor drugs to decrease or increase blood pressure while recording renal sympathetic nerve discharge in conscious normal rats as well as in rats with congestive heart failure (ligation of the left coronary artery), DiBona and associates studied the relationship between blood pressure and renal nerve activity (31). The authors further examined the effects of intravenously or intracerebroventricular angiotensin II AT I-receptor blockade (losartan) on these function curves. Rats suffering from congestive heart failure as compared to the normal animals showed a reduced range of sympathetic control and a decrease in maximum gain but no resetting of the function curve. While the intravenous or intracerebroventricular application of losartan did not affect the function curve in the normal rats, it restored the reduced gain in congestive heart failure to reach 80 % of that observed in the control rats. Although it should be considered that renal sympathetic nerve discharge for methodological reasons had to be plotted in % of control, a comparison of the function curves in congestive heart failure before and after losartan in Fig. 3 of the study even suggests some resetting. However, the most important finding in the study was that losartan administration to conscious

Physiology and pathophysiology of baroreceptor function 27
rats with heart failure decreased renal sympathetic nerve discharge at an unchanged arterial blood pressure (31).
There is also support from a most recent observation in man; converting enzyme inhibition decreased systolic pressure in patients with heart failure and in control subjects. However, sympathetic nerve activity to skeletal muscle (rnicroneurography) decreased in patients and increased in control subjects. The baroreftex responses (phenylephrine, sodium nitroprusside, lower body negative pressure, and head down tilt) were enhanced by converting enzyme inhibition in patients but not in nonnal control subjects (27).
Conclusions
Altogether there is growing evidence that at least with regard to the loss of vagal control of heart rate and the enhanced sympathetic nerve discharge, the renin-angiotensin-system seems to play an essential role in congestive heart failure by setting the tonic level of sympathetic nerve discharge. Due to their high dynamic sensitivity the arterial baroreceptors can detect even slight changes in arterial pulse contour. The resulting disinhibition of the renal sympathetic nerves will in concert with the pressure-dependent mechanism activate the renin-angiotensin system. This activation may be switched off as soon as the resulting sodium and water retention has found a new steady-state in total body sodium and water. By signalling the state of filling of the low pressure system and by their inhibitory action on the renal nerves, the cardiopulmonary afferents are probably participating in the setting of this steady state, but other factors downregulating Ang II and Aldesterone are probably also involved. In this way even the failing heart is able to stabilize blood pressure at a level which inhibits renin release and prevents severe decreases in glomerular filtration. However, when in spite of the volume expansion the failing heart is unable to provide a minimal perfusion pressure for the brain and the kidneys, renin activation and volume retention seems to go on unlimited finally leading to decompensation. The angiotensin-dependent increase in tonic sympathetic discharge may be especially important in the latter situation, constituting a last line of defence. It needs more integrative studies in experimental animals and man to provide evidence for this hypothesis and several other speculations in this review.

Abstract
This review focuses gn the role of the myocardial force-frequency relation (FFR) in human ventricular performance and how changes in the FFR can reduce cardiac output and, ultimately, can contribute to altering the stability of the in-vivo cardiovascular system in a way that contributes to the progression of heart failure. Changes in the amplitude, shape, and position of the myocardial FFR occurring in various forms of heart failure are characterized in terms of maximal isometric twitch tension, slope of the ascending limb (myocardial reserve), and position of the peak of the FFR on the frequency axis (optimum stimulation frequency). All three of these parameters decline according to severity of myocardial disease in the following order: non-failing atrial septal defect, non-failing coronary artery disease, non-failing coronary artery disease with diabetes mellitus, failing mitral regurgitation, failing viral myocarditis, failing idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Evidence is presented supporting a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-pump based mechanism for this progressive depression of the FFR. Intracellular calcium cycling and concentration and Capump content all diminish in proportion to degree of depression of the FFR. Additional evidence from myocyte culture studies suggests a cause of diminished Ca-pump content is sustained, elevated levels of plasma norepinephrine. Ahypothesis is presented to explain the mechanism of myocardial failure and its progression in terms of changes in the cardiovascular feedback control system that are triggered by reduced moycardial reserve. Sustained elevation of plasma norepinephrine levels depresses expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-pump protein causing depression of the FFR and this causes a compensatory further increase in norepinephrine levels and a further depression of Ca-pump protein.

Introduction
This review focuses on the role of the myocardial force-frequency relation in human ventricular performance and how changes in it can reduce cardiac output and, ultimately,

38 N. R. Alpert et al.
can contribute to altering the stability of the in-vivo cardiovas-cular system in a way that contributes to progression of heart failure.

The contribution of frequency treppe to cardiac output
The inherent ability of ventriular myocardium to increase its strength of contraction (independent of neurohormonal intervention) in response to an increase in contraction frequency is known as frequency treppe. This myocardial property causes contractile force to rise as contraction frequency is increased from 60 to about 180 beats per minute (bpm) and to then decline with further increase in frequency (the force-frequency relation "FFR", see Fig. I). The importance of this myocardial property in vivo is demonstrated by the following cardiovascular response to exercise. In normal subjects producing maximal work output on an upright exercise bicycle, cardiac output is increased 3-fold above it~ resting level. About 70 % of this increase results directly from increased number of ejections per minute at the higher exercise heart rate. The remaining 30 % results from an increase in stroke volume that is brought about by a 50 % decrease in left ventricular endsystolic volume (10, 23). Although the Frank-Starling relation of the myocardium causes this decrease in ventricular volume to reduce contractile strength, the presence of a normal frequency treppe (i.e ., a positively sloped myocardial FFR) causes an increase in contractile strength and this

pathic dilated cardiomyopathy failing (OeM, n = 6) (15) myocardial strips at 37 °C.

Force-frequency relation in heart failure 39
compensates for the Frank-Starling effect. This suggests, as much as 40 % of the increase in cardiac output that occurs with exercise may depend on an intact FFR in normal
myocardium (10). In this light the frequency treppe of the myocardium can be considered
to be an important, built-in "stroke volume reserve" capable of increasing ventricular ejection independent of the Frank-Starling relation and independent of the systemic neurohumoral control system or its receptors in the myocyte membranes (24).
Myocardial biopsy and dissection of strip preparations
Subepicardial tissue was obtained from the anterior segment of the left ventricular wall of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, mitral valve surgery, or cardiac transplant. Control myocardium was obtained from coronary artery bypass patients who had normal left ventricular wall motion and normal left ventricular function (i.e., ejection fraction greater than 0.60). A subset of these patients had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Failing myocardium was obtained from patients undergoing mitral valve surgery (NYHA Class II-III failure, mean LV ejection fraction = 0.64 ± O.OS) and from hearts explanted from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients (NYHA Class IV failure, mean LV ejection fraction = 0.13 ± 0.0 I).
Surgical biopsies were obtained shortly after cardioplegic arrest (16). Patients gave informed, written consent before participating in the study which was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the University ofVermont. There were no complications resulting from the biopsy procedure in any patient. The excised tissue was immediately submerged in room temperature, pre-oxygenated BDM-protective solution. The BDMprotective solution for dissection consisted of Krebs-Ringer solution plus 30 mmol/l 2,3butanedione monoxime (14). After a 60 min recovery from surgical trauma the biopsy was dissected into thin strips approximately 0.2 to 0.4 mm in diameter (16). All measurements were made in Krebs-Ringer solution after washing out the protective solution. Forskolin was dissolved in 9S % ethanol and introduced into the 90 ml muscle baths in 2 uL aliquot to give O.S uM Forskolin and not higher than 20 uM ethanol.
Apparatus and measurements
Isometric twitch tension was measured at the peak of the tension-length relation (Lmax) in each muscle strip preparation using the same apparatus, methods, and protocols as described previously (1S). The steady-state force-frequency relation of each strip was obtained at 37°C with S min of stimulation at each frequency starting at 0 .2 Hz (12 min-I) and increasing in 0.2 Hz increments. Peak twitch tension of the steady-state myograms was measured by digital readout and averaged at each frequency across all strips in each group. The length at Lmax (3.S to 4 mm) and the blotted weight (0.2 to 0.6 mg) of the active portion of each muscle strip was measured and the quotient was used to calculate its cross-sectional area.

The FFR in non-failing human myocardium
Although the heart rate dependence of myocardial contractility has been well documented for most animal species (11), it has only been since the advent of open heart surgery and cardiac transplantation that such information has become available for human myocardium. Our dissection method produces viable myocardial strips that are thin enough to be adequately oxygenated in an aqueous muscle bath at physiological temperature and contraction frequencies (14, 16). The validity of assessing myocardial function from surgically isolated strips of left ventricular human myocardium is supported by our finding of good agreement between the in vitro frequency treppe obtained from strips prepared from non-failing hearts and ventricular function curves obtained by others from non-failing hearts in vivo (13). The average force-frequency relation obtained in vitro from non-failing myocardium at 37 °C is shown in Fig 1.
The FFR in failing human myocardium
Fig. I shows the average FFR curves for failing left ventricular myocardium obtained in vitro at 37 °C. Expression of the peak isometric twitch amplitude in tension units (force per unit cross-section of strip preparation) allows averaging of curves from all patients with the same diagnosis. There are clear depressions of both the maximal tension and the frequency at the peak of the FFR (optimum stimulation frequency) in the failing preparations. This depression in itself is expected to severely limit the maximal systolic performance of these ventricles. In addition to the depression at any given heart rate, it is also important to note the additional loss resulting from the accompanying blunting of the rising phase of the FFR in heart failure. This decrease in slope of the ascending limb of the FFR ("blunting of the treppe response") at frequencies between resting and optimum heart rates may play an important role in progression of heart failure as described below.
As an index of relative strength of the treppe response we define myocardial reserve as the percent increase in in vitro contractile strength occurring when contraction frequency is increased from 60 to 120 bpm (see Fig. 2). A decrease in slope of the myocardial FFR represents a loss of stroke volume reserve in the ventricle. We consider this myopathic because decreased myocardial reserve would not adequately support the increased ventricular function needed during exercise. Fig. 3 shows average values of myocardial reserve measured in both non-failing myocardium and various types and degrees of heart failure.
Note that even though all three right hand histograms in Fig. 3 are from groups of patients with normal LV wall motion and normal ejection fraction, there is a clear decline in myocardial reserve between patients with atrial septal defect (ASD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and coronary artery disease with diabetes mellitus (CAD + DM). Of particular note is the finding of considerable depression in myocardial reserve (about 50 %) in the diabetic CAD's compared with the non-diabetic coronary artery disease group (CAD). This suggests that in the diabetic CADs, systemic compensatory effects in vivo may mask a depressed myocardial contractility, restoring normal resting LV function but leaving the diabetic heart less capable of surviving future coronary obstructions or other increased demands for myocardial reserve.

To construct these curves tension independet heat was measured by thermopile myothermometry (8) and was converted to an equivalent quantity of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake using 17 kllmole Ca2+pumped as the enthalpy of the SR Ca-ATPase and subtracting 13 % to allow for Na+ extrusion .

cardiomyopathy (VM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) groups were in NYHA Class IV, end-stage failure at the time of cardiac transplantation. Note the extreme depression in the DCM group in which the average myocardial reserve has actually reversed to about - 7 %, a negative treppe, indicating weakening of the myocardium with tachycardia.

STI MULATION FREQUENCY (min -1)

Fig.5 Influence of stimulation frequency on intracellular Ca2+transients and isometric twitch tension in a muscle strip from a non-failing heart and from a heart with end-stage failing dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Changes in the Ca2+ transients, as reflected by the aequorin light emission (triangles), are given in mV (right ordinate); changes in the isometric twitch tension (circles) are given in mN/mm2 (left ordinate). From Fig. 2 ofPieske et al. (22) with permission.

Force-frequency relation in heart failure 43
The histograms in Fig. 3 have been positioned along the horizontal axis according to the contraction frequency at which each group's FFR peaks (see Optimum Frequency axis in Fig. 3). The presence of a direct correlation between the optimum frequency and the myocardial reserve suggests both are governed by the same (or a number of tightly coupled) intracellular mechanisms within the myocytes. Our myothermal measurements of tension independent heat, an index calcium cycled per twitch in DCM and non-failing CAD myocardium, suggest the cellular mechanism underlying depression of the FFR in failing myocardium involves alterations in the calcium handling system. Fig. 4 shows both quantity of calcium cycled per beat and the rate of its removal from the cytoplasm to be diminished by about 70 % in DCM failure (8).
More recent, direct measurements of intracellular calcium transients (Fig. 5) using the aequorin method indicate the depression in quantity of calcium cycled per twitch is accompanied by similar depressions in intracellular calcium concentration in DCM myocardium compared with normal myocardium (22). In addition to depressed calcium delivery during a twitch, the data in Fig. 5 show the negative twitch tension treppe DCM is underlaid by a corresponding negative treppe in the calcium transients as seen when stimulation frequency is increased. In non-failing myocardium (Fig. 5) the peak calcium signal increased by 58 % between 60 and 120 bpm while peak twitch tension rose by 80 %. In the DCM-failing myocardium the peak calcium signal fell by 11 % while peak twitch tension fell by 15 % over the same frequency range. In both groups the change in twitch tension per change in calcium signal was 1.37 giving evidence that altered calcium cycling is the main mechanism of force-frequency treppe and for its depression in DCM failure.
The majority of calcium ions required to activate a systolic contraction are supplied by the sarcoplasmic reticulum in adult myocardium. The amount released depends on the beatto-beat storage of calcium and this depends, in turn, on the calcium uptake velocity of calcium pump. The frequency treppe is likely caused by a speeding up of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump due to increased phosphorylation of its control proteins by calcium dependent calmodulin kinase (18, 25). Changes in the action potential and in phosphorylation of surface membrane calcium channels may also contribute to the treppe mechanism.

Fig.8 Correlation between myocardial reserve and calcium pump content in NF and end-stage, DCM-failing myocardium. Myocardial reserve is calculated as the change in peak twitch tension between 120 bpm and 30 bpm ("Change in Twitch Tension"). Calcium pump content is measured as sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase normalized per total protein. Adapted from Fig. 5 of Hasenfuss et al. (9).

Force-frequency relation in heart failure 45
depress its myocardial reserve similar to that of the failing myocardium. These expectations are borne out as shown in Fig. 6 and 7. In MR-failing myocardium addition of forskolin, believed to increase calcium pump function by increasing cycling-AMP activated phosphorylation of phospholamban, there is a significant reversal of the depressed FFR including increase in the myocardial reserve and optimum stimulation frequency to near normal values (Fig. 6 and (21)). Conversely, depression of calcium pump function by addition of the drug KN-62, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+ activated, calmodulin-kinase mediated activation of the Thr!7 site in phospholamban, depresses the myocardial reserve and optimal stimulation frequency of non-failing myocardium to mimic that of MR-failing myocardium (Fig. 7).
These experimental demonstrations of calcium pump dependence of the FFR are supported by the finding (Fig. 8) of a direct correlation between the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump and the myocardial reserve (or optimal frequency) of the FFR in samples from both DCM-failing and non-failing donor hearts (9).
Evidence supporting the role of the decreased calcium pump protein (SERCA2) as a strong contributor to decreased calcium pump ATPase and to depression of the FFR in human myocardium is seen in Fig. 9 (12). Calcium pump protein levels are depressed by 40 % on a total protein basis and by 25 % with respect to phospholamban content. This suggests in DCM-failing myocardium, in-vivo calcium pump function would be depressed both by reduction of pump content and also by having relatively more inhibition (at any given level of phosphorylation) due to an increased amount of phospholamban protein compared with calcium pump protein.
As seen in Fig. 10 there is an increase in relative content of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger protein in DCM-failing myocardium. This increase may compensate to some extent for

possible increases in diastolic calcium levels resulting from the loss of calcium pumping capacity when calcium pump content is reduced.
Since these data strongly suggest that the reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump protein content in failing myocardium is an important contributor to reduction of myocardial reserve it is important to investigate possible mechanisms that may contribute to reduction of calcium pump content. A likely candidate is suggested by the consistent finding of elevated plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels in heart failure. In mitral or aortic valve disease or in idiopathic cardiomyopathy, plasma NE levels at rest are about twice normal. Also, with exercise, NE levels increase three to four times higher than in patients without

Force-frequency relation in heart failure 47
heart failure (3). Plasma NE concentration correlates strongly with left ventricular dysfunction (27) and with mortality (4) in congestive heart failure patients. Since neuroendocrine activation was observed to occur before clinical heart failure ensues (6), a causal relation between elevated plasma NE levels and progression of heart failure is suggested.
This suggestion is supported experimentally by recent findings (see Fig. 11) in tissue culture preparations showing that presence ofNE in the culture medium for 2-3 days causes a 40 % depression in levels of mRNA for calcium pump protein, SERCA2, and for phospholamban in rat myocytes (1, 2, 5). This coupling between sustained elevation ofNE levels and reduced SERCA2 synthesis may be an important contributor to reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump content in the early stages of heart failure in vivo and it may also be a mechanism of progression of heart failure as described next.
Positive feedback hypothesis of progression of heart failure
Since the heart is anatomically and functionally a "component" in a number of feedback control systems in the body (e.g., hemodynamic, hormonal, neuronal), it seems worthwhile to explore the possible role of marked alterations in the dynamic function of diseased myocardium in altering the function of these feedback loops. The transition from a compensated cardiovascular system to a progressively decompensated one may result from conversion of a feedback control system that is stable because of negative feedback (i.e., the system responds to a perturbation by minimizing the effect of the perturbation) to a feedback control system that is unstable because the feedback has become positive (i.e., the system responds to a perturbation by enhancing the effect of the perturbation).
We propose that depression and eventual inversion (i.e., negative treppe) of the myocardial FFR is a mechanism of converting from negative to positive feedback control in the diseased cardiovascular system. The details of the basis for this hypothesis are shown in Fig. 12.
The inner circle in Fig. 12 represents the cardiovascular system functioning under normal conditions. With a transient increase in demand (left top: DEMAND, Transient) for cardiac output (CO), plasma norepinephrine rises (vertical arrow beside norepinephrine). This increases heart rate (see arrow between 70 and 120 bpm on HR axis of the force-frequency plot in Fig. 12). The normal frequency treppe of the myocardium (top FFR curve) causes contractility to rise from 17 to 28 units, therefore stroke volume (SV) increases. The product of increased SV and increased HR increases CO just sufficient to meet the transient demand requiring no further increase in plasma NE. Note that if the lowest FFR were present in this heart (e.g., as in the MR hearts in Fig. 6), the same increase in plasma norepinephrine would cause only about 20 % as much increase in myocardial contractility. In this case the product of increased HR times increased SV would not equal the increased demand for CO, and a further increase in plasma norepinephrine would occur in order to meet the increased demand. The question of the mechanism of progression of heart failure may be the same as the question: how did the lower force-frequency relations get blunted?
On a short term basis elevation of plasma norepinephrine is not detrimental in itself. However, if the demand for increased CO is sustained, a degenerative condition can be established as follows. Refer now to the outer circle in the Fig. 12 representing the case of

HEART RATE (bpm)

Fig. 12 Proposed role of FFR depression in the progression of heart failure . Circular pathways depict the respo nse of the in vivo cardiovascular system to a transient (inner circle) or a sustained plus transient increase in de mand for cardiac output (outer circle). Alterations in the myocardial reserve and optimal stimulation frequency of the myocardium are proposed to result from a s ustained elevation of plasma norepinephrine (hatched region at uppe r right) which leads to further elevation of plasma norepinephrine level s (see text for details). The following abbreviations are used: CO. cardiac output; [Norepinephrinejpi,,,n,' plasma norepinephrine concentration ; HR , heart rate; SV, stroke volume ; vertical arrows indicate amount of increase in associated parameters.

a sustained demand for increased CO. The new factor that comes into play is a norepinephrine-induced decrease in Ca-pump protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum as shown at the lower right in Fig. 12. Hypothesis: sustained (e.g., 2 to 14 days) elevation of in-vivo plasma norepinephrine above a critical level (about I-211M) causes the force-frequency relation to be blunted and left-shifted. This hypothesis suggests the following scenario for development of a depressed force-frequency relation and for progression of myocardial failure : Initially some acute systemic event (e.g., myocarditis or chordal rupture) or a sustained external challenge requires plasma norepinephrine levels to remain elevated in order to maintain adequate cardiac output. If the elevated levels persist above the critical concentration (hatched region in Fig. 12, right), this compensatory response eventually depresses the myocyte Ca-pump mRNA and consequently the Ca-pump content. This blunts the frequency treppe of the myocardium. With the latter alteration the cardiovascular feedback control system, which is still a stable, negative feedback control system (i .e., system reponse compensates for perturbations), now brings about a larger than normal increases in plasma norepinephrine in response to normal activity-related, moment-tomoment changes in demand for increased cardiac output. Hence with each transient increase in activity, the average plasma norepinephrine concentration is elevated even more than is required to compensate for the original systemic event. This additional increase causes further depression of Ca-pump protein concentration and further blunting and shifting of the force-frequency relation . Note that this process constitutes a positive feedback process working at the level of the molecular composition of components in the cardiovascular control system (i.e., the response of the altered system to perturbations causes increased

Force-frequency relation in heart failure 49
alteration in the molecular composition of the system). Transient periods of increased physical activity now become even more effective in degrading myocyte contractility. This eventually results in a rapid, vicious-cycle phase (decompensation) that starts when the continued blunting and left-shifting of the force-frequency curve results in a negative-sloped region at or near the patient's resting heart rate. At this point we have positive feedback
around the signal pathway of the control system (i.e., i norepinephrine - i HR - ~ SV - ~ CO - i norepinephrine) as well as positive feedback around the molecular composition pathway (i.e., i norepinephrine - ~ Ca-pump mRNA - ~ Ca-pump protein - ~ CO - i norepinephrine). With positive feedback in both pathways the control sys-
tem is now wildly unstable and can quickly self-destruct.
Discussion and summary
The positive treppe response of the myocyte following an increase in contraction frequency constitutes an important component (the chronotropic component) of myocardial reserve. This and the Frank-Starling relation (the inotropic component) are the major mechanisms that provide sufficient cardiac reserve to increase cardiac output three- to four-fold above resting levels in response to systemic demands of exercise or other challenges. Depression or blunting of the myocardial treppe response due to myocyte remodeling limits this chronotropic component of myocardial reserve and increases use of the Frank-Starling relation and elevated sympathetic drive in order to meet increased systemic demands. The latter two compensatory actions, although effective and adequate in the acute situation, carry potentially damaging side effects when they persist for protracted periods. Increasing contractile strength by ventricular dilatation carries the risk of excessive myocardial oxygen demand because of the increased ventricular wall stress at the larger diameters. In addition, there is risk of possible remodeling of the wall architecture to accommodate a persistently larger ventricular diameter. Sustained sympathetic over-drive carries the risk of toxic effects of excess catecholamine levels.
Previously it has been postulated that heart failure develops when the compensatory hemodynamic and neurohumoral mechanisms are overwhelmed or exhausted (19) and that the inability of our current therapeutic measures to arrest progression of heart failure results from failure to treat the abnormalities in the neurohormonal system when they begin exerting adverse effects (20). Our positive feedback hypothesis suggests a detailed subcellular mechanism by which the normally compensatory effects of increased plasma and myocardial norepinephrine levels become adverse effects that cause loss of myocardial reserve. This mechanism suggests progression of heart failure involves conversion of the cardiovascular feedback control system from a stable one to an unstable one in which the instabilities contribute to an accelerated destabilization of the control system.
We have described the way in which changes in the slope of the myocardial forcefrequency relation and the frequency at which the curve peaks interact with the systemic neurohormonal control system to govern the increments in plasma norepinephrine that occur in response to a given demand for increased cardiac output. The lower the slope of the force-frequency relation or myocardial reserve, the higher the increment in plasma norepinephrine needs to be to satisfy a given demand for increased cardiac output. We

50 N. R. Alpert et al.
propose that the transition to the state where norepinephrine has adverse rather than compensatory effects occurs because a sufficiently large and sustained increase in myocardial norepinephrine levels results in altered phenotypic expression of excitation-contraction coupling proteins. This alteration in expression includes reduction in calcium pump protein levels which, in tum, results in a blunting of the slope of the myocardial force-frequency relation. This blunting in itself results in still larger increments in plasma norepinephrine levels for a given increment in cardiac output and further blunting of the force-frequency relation. With severe blunting the frequency treppe becomes negative causing positive feedback which then changes the characteristics of both the systemic control system that acutely regulates cardiac output and the one regulating longer-term remodeling of the intracellular components that modulate myocardial contractility. We propose that the resulting instability in both of these systems may be a major contributor to progression of heart failure in its early stages as well as in the later stages when other factors such as desensitization of atrial and aterial baroreceptors, excessive renin release, sodium retention, vasoconstriction, and increased intravascular volume also contribute to cardiovascular deterioration.
There is growing evidence that ~-blocker therapy is effective in reversing cardiomegaly and in improving myocardial function and quality oflife in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (7, 28). These beneficial effects have been attributed to a bradycardia-related increased filling time, reduced myocardial oxygen demand, and recovery of ~-receptor function. However not all patients respond to this therapy. In view of the detrimental effects of a negative treppe as described above, it is possible that an important part of the beneficial effects of ~-blocker therapy may also result from interaction of its bradycardiac effect per se with the FFR. If the bradycardia is sufficient to move the operating range of heart rates to low enough values with respect to peak of the existing force-frequency relation, the negative-sloped region and its detrimental effects may be avoided or less frequently traversed throughout daily activity.
There is considerable between-patient variation in the optimum frequency of the FFR in NYHA Class IV, DCM (10-132 bpm, average 72 ± 17 bpm (16)). In a patient whose resting HR is 80 bpm and whose myocardial force-frequency relation begins its descending limb at this frequency, exertion moves the operating range to the negative-sloped region. The bradycardiac action of ~-blockade will reduce the number of these negative-slope bouts per day. However, if in another patient the negative-sloped region begins at 120-130 bpm, there will be fewer excursions into the negative-sloped region per day and consequently a smaller chance for the bradycardiac effect to avoid these excursions. Thus, between-patient variation in the position of the descending limb of the FFR may be a factor contributing to the between-patient variation in efficacy of ~-blocker therapy. If avoidance of negativeslope operation is the basis for a significant part of the beneficial effect of ~-blocker therapy, the efficacy of this intervention should be predictable by examining the patient's in-vivo (or in-vitro) force-frequency relation. According to this hypothesis the beneficial effect of ~-blocker therapy should be greater, the closer the resting HR is to the negativesloped region of the patient's FFR.

Post-rest contraction amplitude in myocytes from failing human ventricle

Abstract
It has been reported that the balance between the two main Ca2+ removal systems in the cardiac cells, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Na+/Ca2+exchanger, is altered in failing human heart. We have studied post-rest contraction behaviour as a non-invasive probe of the amount of Ca2+ stored in the SR in myocytes from failing and non-failing human ventricle. The first beat following a rest interval, as a percentage of the preceding steady state (B IISS), was larger and more variable in cells from failing heart, indicating some accumulation of Ca2+ in the SR during rest. This could be mimicked by treatment of myocytes with digoxigenin, a compound which increases intracellular Na+, suggesting that alterations in the Na+ balance of the cell might contribute to the effect. Isoprenaline, which stimulates Ca2+ uptake by the SR while the myocyte is beating, prevented SR Ca2+ accumulation during rest in susceptible myocytes. We hypothesize that loss of SR function in the failing heart is partially compensated for by increased Ca2+extrusion via the Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the contracting myocyte, leading to increased intracellular Na+ during activity. This Na+ is lost at rest, predisposing the cells to accumulate Ca2+in the SR. Experiments to test this hypothesis are proposed.

Introduction
The frequency response of single myocytes isolated from human ventricle parallels that of intact myocardium, with a strong positive staircase in non-failing tissue but not in failing (8). We have shown that inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake, using thapsigargin, prevents the positive staircase in non-failing cells and abolishes the difference between myocytes from failing and non-failing hearts at physiological rates of beating (6). In this study we move towards the extremes of low frequency stimulation and examine the rested state beats of human ventricular myocytes. The first beat following a rest interval is thought to be mainly dependent on the Ca2+remaining in the SR, and the decay or potentiation of this contraction relative to steady state has been used as a measure of the remain-

ing SR Ca2+load. Parallel experiments using interventions such as caffeine pulses or rapid cooling, which are known to release SR Ca2+completely, have confirmed that post-rest contraction is directly related to the amount ofCa2+stored (20). Biochemical evidence suggests that the SR Ca2+-ATPase may be compromised in the failing heart, although agreement has not been reached on this point (I, 11 , 13-15, 17). Post-rest experiments therefore represent a potential non-invasive method for investigating SR function in human myocytes.
We have previously shown that there are marked differences in post-rest behaviour between myocytes from failing and non-failing hearts (6). In the present study we have performed experiments using two interventions which have been at least partially successful in normalising the responses of muscle strips from failing human heart to high frequency stimulation. Forskolin (16), or isoprenaline in low (but not high) doses (3,18) restored a positive component to the frequency staircase in muscle strips, despite the fact that ~­ adrenoceptor responses are desensitised in heart failure (9) . The effects of isoprenaline and forskolin may be due to a normalisation of the intracellular cyclic AMP levels, which are decreased in failing compared to non-failing human ventricle in the absence of catecholamines (4, 5, 21). Treatment with agents that raise intracellular Na+ has also been successful in reestablishing a positive staircase in muscle from failing human heart (3, 18). We have examined the effects of submaximal isoprenaline concentrations, and of digoxigenin, on the post-rest characteristics of myocytes from failing and non-failing human ventricle. Digoxigenin was chosen over digoxin because of the discovery that several of the cardiac glycosides have direct actions on the cardiac SR Ca2+ release channel (12): digoxigenin does not have these effects. We show that both isoprenaline and digoxigenin modify rest-dependent behaviour, but in opposing directions.
Methods
The patient group used in the present study are as previously described (6), with the addition of one patient with heart failure and two subjects with non-failing hearts. Myocytes were isolated from failing and non-failing left ventricular myocardium according to our standard protocol for large and biopsy-sized samples (8). Contraction amplitude was measured using a video motion detector, as before (8, 10). Myocytes contracting at the basal frequency of 0.2 Hz (32 °C) were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min or more. When the contraction amplitude was stable, rest intervals of 10 s, 30 s or 3 min were interposed; contraction was allowed to recover for 1-5 min between rests. Cells were then exposed to increasing concentrations of isoprenaline (from 0.0 1 nM) or digoxigenin (from 1 J..LM) until amplitude at least doubled from control values, and the rest protocol repeated. In selected cases, the inotropic agent was washed out, and a third rest protocol performed in a concentration of Ca2+ which matched the inotropic effect of the agent. When used, thapsigargin (1 f.1M) was applied to contracting cells for 20 min before rest protocols were performed.
Statistics
When data were obtained from more than one myocyte from each preparation the results
were pooled, so that values are mean ± sem where n =patients (except for Fig. 3 where

Post-rest contraction amplitude in myocytes from failing human ventricle 55
results from individual myocytes are shown). Results were compared by paired or unpaired t-test, with correction for unequal variances where appropriate. Data were tested for normality, and where this was not confirmed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used instead of the two-sample t-test. Analysis of variance and linear regression were performed on pooled data using the MINITAB program (Pennsylvania).
ResuHs
Post-rest contraction in myocytes from failing and non-failing ventricle
The size of the first post-rest contraction, relative to the previous steady-state is shown in Fig. 1 for myocytes from 27 failing and 20 non-failing ventricles; these data are updated from Davia et al. (6). There was no significant change in the steady state contraction over the course of the rest protocols, and amplitude returned to this level within 1 min of resumption of stimulation. There was pronounced post-rest decay in myocytes from non-failing ventricle, of a similar order to that we have observed in guinea-pig or rabbit myocardium (7). Post-rest decay was less pronounced in cells from failing heart, with post-rest contraction amplitude significantly higher than non-failing at IDs (P < 0.0 1),30 s

It should be noted that there was a residual post-rest decay in the presence of thapsigargin, indicating that there is a non-SR dependent rest-sensitive mechanism in human ventricle which does not change with heart failure.

relation between post-rest decay and previous exposure of the patient to Ca2+ antagonists was noted (6). Figure 3 shows the size of the first post-rest beat relative to steady state contraction (B l/SS) from individual myocytes following a 3 min rest interval. The arrow represents the decay in the presence of thapsigargin (non-SR-dependent condition) for comparison. Analysis of variance revealed that the between-patient variation was signifi-
cantly (P = 0.001) greater than the within-patient (between cell): this indicates that
myocytes from a given patient behaved in a similar way. Following thapsigargin treatment, variability was significantly reduced in both the non-failing and failing groups (variance ratio before:after thapsigargin P < 0.001 for both groups).
Isoprenaline on post-rest contraction
Concentrations of isoprenaline close to the ECso value (10) were used; these ranged between 10-8 M and 10-7 M for failing and 3 x 10-11 M and 3 x 10-8 M for non-failing hearts. Stimulation by isoprenaline had little effect on post-rest decay in non-failing myocytes (Fig. 4)
or in failing myocytes with pre-existing post-rest decay (n =2, data not shown). However,
post-rest potentiation in myocytes from failing heart was converted to decay in the presence of isoprenaline. B l/SS (3 min), following isoprenaline pretreatment, was no longer significantly different between myocytes from non-failing (49.7 ± 6.5 %, n = 4) and failing
(6S.0 ± IO.S, n = 5) hearts. Addition of equal inotropic concentrations of Ca2+ did not
produce the same effect; in one experiment basal contraction amplitude in I mM Ca2+ (change in cell length with each beat) was less than 0.5 11m, and this was raised to 7.2 11m by either 3 x 10-8 M isoprenaline, or by 6 mM Ca2+. In 6 mM Ca2+, B l/SS was lIS %, while in isoprenaline this was reduced to 54.2 %.

Digoxigenin on post-rest contraction
The inotropic effects of digoxigenin started at 1 11M, and the average increase in contrac-
tion was 65.8 ± 10.9 %. The effect of digoxigenin was to minimise post-rest decay; a sample trace is shown in Fig. 5, and summarised data in Fig. 6. The effect was seen in cells from either failing or non-failing hearts which had originally shown post-rest decay. Once again, simply increasing Ca2+ did not produce the same effect as digoxigenin. In one experiment, B l/SS was initially 21.4 % after 3 min rest under basal conditions and exposure to 10-5 M digoxigenin increased B l/SS to 100 %. After washout of digoxigenin, B l/SS was 22.2 %, which indicates the stability of the measurement. Raising Ca2+ to 12 mM, a concentration which resulted in a decrease in diastolic length (a sign of Ca2+ overload) had little effect, with B l/SS remaining at 29 %.

Post-rest contraction amplitude in myocytes from failing human ventricle 59
Discussion
We have shown that myocytes from the failing heart are more variable in their post-rest behaviour, and more likely to exhibit post-rest potentiation of contraction than those from non-failing. This is due to accumulation of Ca2+in the SR during rest: emptying of the SR stores by prolonged treatment with thapsigargin abolishes post-rest potentiation and significantly reduces variability between cells. The presence of thapsigargin reveals another rest-sensitive mechanism that is presumably non-SR dependent. Therefore, to decide whether Ca2+has accumulated in the SR during rest under a given condition we compared the size of the first post-rest beat to that after thapsigargin.
The patient-to-patient differences were shown statistically to be greater than the cell-tocell differences in a given preparation, but we have not yet identified any factors associated with the patient that would predispose to the appearance of post-rest potentiation. Neither patient age, nor etiology of disease, drug treatment or type of preparation (large sample v. biopsy) was significantly associated with large post-rest beats in the subsequently isolated myocyte (6). In the present study we describe preliminary experiments in which we have attempted to manipulate post-rest behaviour with digoxigenin or isoprenaline.
Digoxigenin was used in concentrations producing increases of contraction amplitude of around 50 %. Since this aglycone has no direct effect on SR Ca2+ release (12), the inotropic effect is mainly due to an increase in intracellular Na+. At these concentrations, digoxigenin increased the size of the first post-rest beat in myocytes which had previously shown post-rest decay. Interestingly, the effect was much more marked in cells from failing or non-failing human heart than in those from guinea-pig, where digoxigenin concentrations with similar inotropic effects raised the post-rest contraction slightly after 30 s rest, but not after 3 min (Davia and Harding, unpublished observations). After digoxigenin, human myocytes behave more like those of rat, where post-rest potentiation is common (2). Rat myocardium has a naturally high intracellular Na+ concentration, and it has been shown that Ca2+ is actively taken up by the rat myocyte at rest (19). It has been hypothesised that the Na+/Ca2+exchange runs in the direction ofNa+ extrusion and Ca2+uptake at rest, because of this high intracellular Na+. We suggest that during contraction in the failing myocyte the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is the main mechanism for Ca2+ removal, since SERCA levels are reduced (11, 14). Na+ accumulates during contraction, and in the subsequent rest period either exchanges for Ca2+or prevents effective Ca2+extrusion.
Isoprenaline had the converse effect to digoxigenin, producing little change in post-rest behaviour in myocytes from non-failing heart, but reversing post-rest potentiation in those from failing heart. We hypothesize that the increase in intracellular cyclic AMP stimulates SERCA2a function through phosphorylation of phospholamban, thus, restoring some of the Ca2+ uptake function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduces the dependence on Na+/Ca2+ exchange for Ca2+removal, preventing the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and reducing the probability of Ca2+accumulation by the cell at rest. Stimulation of SERCA2a by cyclic AMP may also underlie the restoration of the positive staircase with increasing frequency by isoprenaline or forskolin (3,16). Reductions in both SERCA2a protein levels and basal intracellular cyclic AMP have been reported for failing heart, and it is not yet known which makes the most contributions to the loss of SR Ca2+-uptake function.
Increasing extracellular Ca2+to match the inotropic effects of isoprenaline or digoxigenin did not alter the post-rest beat appreciably. This was unexpected; it might be predicted that high pre-rest intracellular Ca2+ combined with high extracellular Ca2+ during rest would delay full extrusion and predispose to SR Ca2+accumulation. We have also noted in guinea-

60 K. Davia and S. E. Harding
pig myocardium that increasing extracellular Ca2+ does not convert post-rest decay to potentiation (unpublished observations).
These preliminary findings must now be investigated further, for example, by manipulation of intracellular Na+ levels using low Na+ or Na+/Ca2+ free media during rest and contraction in these myocytes. Measurement of intracellular Na+ activities, their cyclic AMP-dependence, and their relation to post-rest and frequency-dependent changes in contraction will also be required to determine functional effects of the biochemical changes seen in failing human heart.

Abstract
The data presented indicate that altered systolic and diastolic function in failing human hearts may result from altered expression of calcium cycling proteins. Decreased systolic force production and inversion of the force-frequency relation seem to be related to reduced protein levels of SR Ca2+ ATPase and/or to increased protein levels of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger resulting in an increased ratio of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to SR Ca2+ ATPase. Impaired diastolic function may result from reduced SR Ca2+ ATPase and is most pronounced in failing hearts with lack of upregulation of the Na+-Ca2+exchanger. Thus, failing hearts with reduced SR Ca2+ATPase protein levels and unchanged Na+-Ca2+exchanger protein levels exhibit severe impairment of both systolic and diastolic function.

Introduction
Increased heart rate during exercise enhances cardiac output through an increased number of beats per minute as well as by its action on myocardial performance. The latter, termed force-frequency relation, strength-interval relation, or Treppe (staircase) phenomenon has first been observed by Bowditch in the isolated frog heart (3) . Recent studies demonstrated that the force-frequency relation is also present in isolated myocardium from nonfailing human hearts. However, in failing human myocardium, the force-frequency relation is flattened or inversed (7, 11, 27). The altered force-frequency behavior in failing human myocardium has also been observed in clinical studies showing depressed frequency potentiation of hemodynamic parameters of myocardial performance (6, 13). A positive force-frequency relation was also observed in conscious dogs with and without autonomic blockade (9). This finding, however, is in contrast to other animal studies in which the forcefrequency relation was flat during control conditions and not significantly altered in failure models (5, 15). Interestingly, frequency-potentiation of force can be significantly enhanced by adrenergic stimulation (17). For in vitro experiments in isolated myocardium, the term

force-frequency relation generally is used to describe the relation between stimulation rate and developed force of the myocardium which represents the amplitude between diastolic force and peak systolic force. Accordingly. alterations of the force-frequency relation in failing human myocardium may result from altered systolic or altered diastolic function or from a combination of both (Fig. 1). In this manuscript we discuss recent findings of subcellular and molecular alterations which may underly the altered force-frequency relation of the failing human heart.

transients have been evaluated using the photoprotein aequorin (30). As is shown in Fig. 2, the frequency-dependent increase in isometric force observed in nonfailing human myocardium is associated with a parallel increase in aequorin light signal indicating frequency-dependent increase in intracellular calcium transients. In contrast, inversion of the force-frequency relation is associated with a frequency-dependent decline of the calcium transients, possibly indicating decreased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum at higher stimulation rates in the failing human heart. This in turn may result from altered calcium-induced calcium release despite normal calcium load of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) or from alterations in the SR calcium content.
To investigate these possibilities, post-rest potentiation and rapid cooling contractures have been measured in nonfailing and failing human myocardium (31 , 32); Fig. 3 shows post- rest contractile behavior of nonfailing and failing human myocardium. When

stimulation is stopped for a defined period of time, calcium is eliminated from the cytosol predominantly by calcium uptake into the SR and by calcium elimination across the sarcolemma by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Force development upon restimulation, thus, depends on the relative activity of these two transport mechanisms. As is obvious from the upper part of Fig. 3, post-rest potentiation of isometric force occurs in the nonfailing human myocardium indicating dominance of SR calcium uptake over transsarcolemmal calcium elimination. In contrast in a muscle strip from a failing human heart (lower 2 tracings) postrest potentiation of force is attenuated after a rest period of lOs and even converted to rest

decay after a period of 120 s. This indicates increased transsarcolemmal calcium elimination relative to SR calcium uptake during the rest interval in the failing compared to the nonfailing myocardium. Disturbed sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling as a dominant cause for the altered force-frequency relation was also suggested from rapid cooling contracture experiments. This technique is based on the fact that rapid cooling (within 1 s) of a muscle strip results in instantaneous release of all calcium stored in the SR with subsequent activation of contractile proteins and development of a contracture. The amplitude. of the contracture is an index of the calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. There is a pronounced increase in cooling contractures with increasing stimulation rates of twitches preceeding the rapid cooling procedure in nonfailing myocardium (middle panel of Fig. 4). The frequency-dependent increase in cooling contractures is blunted in the failing human heart (lower panel of Fig. 4).
The alterations of post-rest potentiations and rapid cooling contractures observed in the failing human myocardium strongly suggest that sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium loading is disturbed in the failing human heart and that this is the dominant defect underlying blunting or inversion of the force-frequency relation. This does of course not exclude that alterations in calcium-induced calcium release at the level of the sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel or the SR calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) are also involved.

Following steady state stimulation at 0.25 Hz temperature of the organ bath is rapidly decreased from 37°C to 1°C (upper panel) which results in complete SR calcium release and development of a contracture. Rewarming results in a rapid increase in force due to changes in calcium sensitivity (rewarming spike) followed by complete relaxation of the muscle. Thereafter, stimulation rate was increased to 3.0 Hz and the rapid cooling procedure was repeated during steady state force development. Cross-sectional areas of muscle strips were 0.28 mm2 (nonfailing) and 0.24 mm2 (failing).

Regarding L-type calcium channels, measurements in isolated myocytes indicated that calcium current densities, measured during basal conditions, were similar in myocytes from failing hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy and from nonfailing hearts (2, 22). However, measurements by Piot et al. recently suggested that function of L-type calcium channels may be altered in human heart failure (33). They observed that increasing stimulation frequencies augment calcium currents in myocytes from nonfailing hearts, whereas high frequency upregulation of calcium currents was lost or attenuated in myocytes from hearts with reduced left ventricular function. These findings may indicate that blunting of frequency-dependent upregulation of L-type calcium current and, thus, altered calciuminduced calcium release may contribute to the altered force-frequency relation in the failing human heart.
Regarding function of ryanodine receptors and interaction between L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors, a recent finding by Gomez et al. in failing rat hearts should be discussed (10). They observed that the relationship between calcium current density and the probability of evoking a calcium spark, i.e., opening of one or a few ryanodine receptors, is reduced in myocytes from failing hearts, indicating that calcium influx through L-type calcium channels is less effective in inducing SR calcium release in this rat model. The authors suggested that this may be the consequence of altered spatial orientation ofL-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors. Of note, one major difference between this study in failing rat hearts and findings in failing human hearts is that SR calcium accumulation and load were unaltered in the rat myocardium.
Altered function ofryanodine receptor was also suggested by D' Agnolo et al. (4). They found that caffeine threshold of the ryanodine receptor was increased, indicating impaired gating mechanism of the calcium release channel in dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, Nimer et al. reported differences in response to ryanodine between failing and nonfailing human myocardium which may also reflect altered function of the ryanodine receptor (29). In contrast, Holmberg and Williams who studied activity of single ryanodine receptors under voltage-clamp conditions reported normal basal properties of the ryanodine receptor from failing human hearts (16). Thus, no conclusive data on possible alterations in function of ryanodine receptors or coupling between L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors are available. Such changes could contribute to the altered function of the failing human heart.
Molecular alterations
Under physiological conditions calcium release from the SR is the dominant regulatory mechanism for systolic activation of contractile proteins and force development. Assuming unaltered function ofL-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors and unaltered interaction between both, calcium release from the SR is determined by SR calcium load. The latter depends on SR calcium uptake by SR Ca2+ATPase which is in competition with sarcolemmal calcium elimination by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Thus, regarding systolic function, the Na+-Ca2+exchanger opposes the action of SR Ca2+ATPase. Although the Na +Ca2+ exchanger can work in both directions and can directly activate contractile proteins, the latter seems to occur only with unphysiological high experimental intracellular calcium concentrations (1). Regarding diastolic function of the myocardium, SR Ca2+ATPase and Na+-Ca2+exchanger work in concert.

SR function and force-frequency relation 69
In the failing human heart SR calcium uptake was shown to be reduced and Na+-Ca2+ exchange to be increased (14, 19,34,36). Reduced SR calcium uptake may result from decreased SR calcium ATPase protein levels and from decreased activity of the pump (24, 35-37), and increased Na+-Ca2+exchange may result from increased protein levels (8, 37, and for review see Ref. 12). Decreased SR Ca2+ ATPase and increased Na+-Ca2+exchanger favor decreased SR calcium load and, thus, decreased calcium available for release and systolic activation of contractile proteins in the failing human heart. In contrast, with respect to diastolic function, reduced SR Ca2+ATPase protein levels and activity may be partly compensated by increased Na+-Ca2+exchanger protein levels. However, it should be mentioned that a previous study did not find an impairment of SR calcium uptake in failing human myocardium (25).
Relationship between altered force-frequency relation and SR Ca2+ ATPase protein levels
In order to test the hypothesis that altered force-frequency relation may be related to altered protein levels of SR Ca2+ ATPase, we plotted the relation between the frequency-dependent change in contractile force and protein levels of SR Ca2+ ATPase both measured in myocardium from the same hearts. As is shown in Fig. 5, there is a close positive correla-

tion between both parameters. Important to note, a significant correlation also exists when the regression analysis is performed from the data of failing human hearts exclusively. This may indicate that protein levels of SR Ca2+ATPase and thereby activity of the pump system are a major determinant of frequency-dependent potentiation of contractile force. In this study, protein levels of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger as a potential covariant were not investigated.
Relationship between frequency-dependence of systolic and diastolic force and protein levels of SR Ca2+ATPase and Na+-Ca2+exchanger
The relevance of SR Ca2+ATPase and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein levels on systolic and diastolic function was evaluated in a study which was primarily designed to test the hypothesis that in end-stage failing human hearts with blunted force-frequency relation and decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium accumulation diastolic function would depend on protein levels of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Indeed, as is shown in Fig. 6, there is a significant inverse correlation between the rise of diastolic force following an increase in the stimulation rate from 30 to 180 min-1 and protein levels of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. In a further analysis, hearts were divided into two groups depending on frequency-dependent behavior of diastolic function (Fig. 7). In those hearts exhibiting a frequency-dependent rise of diastolic force (group II), alteration of the force-frequency relation was more severe than in those hearts with normal diastolic function (group I) (Fig. 7). Na+-Ca2+exchanger levels were significantly higher in group I hearts as compared to group II and to nonfailing hearts

(Fig. 8). Moreover, SR Ca2+ ATPase protein levels in group II were significantly lower compared to nonfailing hearts (Fig. 8). Because Na+-Ca2+ exchange opposes SR Ca2+ ATPase regarding SR calcium accumulation, we also calculated the ratio of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to SR Ca2+ ATPase. This ratio was significantly increased in both groups of failing hearts by a factor of about 3 relative to nonfailing hearts. In other words, by discriminating the hearts depending on their diastolic function, two subgroups of failing hearts are obtained: 1) hearts with normal diastolic function and moderately altered force-frequency relation (group I), and 2) hearts with impaired diastolic function and severely altered force-frequency relation (group II). In group II, SR Ca2+ATPase was significantly decreased relative to nonfailing hearts and Na+-Ca2+exchanger was significantly lower than in group I hearts. This indicates reduced capacity of the SR to accumulate calcium for subsequent systolic release and severely reduced overall capacity to remove calcium from the cytosol to preserve diastolic function. In group I, SR Ca2+ATPase is not significantly altered and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is increased compared to nonfailing myocardium. This may indicate that overall capacity for calcium removal from the cytosol is not impaired but rather increased. Important to note, although SR Ca2+ATPase is not significantly reduced in group I compared to nonfailing hearts, blunting of the force-frequency could be explained by a

significant increase in the ratio of Na+-Ca2+exchanger to SR Ca2+ATPase. This may indicate a relative shift of calcium transport by SR Ca2+ATPase towards the Na+-Ca2+exchanger which may result in calcium loss across the sarcolemma and decreased SR calcium content. Of course, alterations in protein levels do not necessarily mean that overall function of these proteins is altered in the failing heart.
Besides alterations in protein expression of SR Ca2+ATPase and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, levels of protein phosphorylation as well as intracellular sodium levels are critically important for transport activity into the SR or across the sarcolemma. Phosphorylation of phospholamban, the regulatory protein of SR Ca2+ ATPase, by protein kinase A and calcium/calmodulin - dependent protein kinase results in increased calcium sensitivity and activity of the pump (1S, 3S). Because the f3-adrenoceptor-adenylyl cyclase system is downregulated in the failing human heart which may result in decreased protein kinase A activity, reduced phosphorylation of phospholamban may contribute to decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport and altered force-frequency relation. Accordingly, Mulieri et al. (2S) showed that stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin reverses the inverse force-frequency relation in failing human myocardium. Regarding the intracellular sodium concentration it is important to note that the electrochemical sodium gradient determines activity of the Na+-Ca2+exchanger which extrudes one calcium ion for three sodium ions. Differences in intracellular sodium concentration seem to be a major factor for species differences in force-frequency behavior. In this regard, high intracellular sodium in rat myocardium which exhibits an inverse force-frequency relation may favor calcium influx

or decrease calcium efflux by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger resulting in high SR calcium load already at low stimulation frequencies (21). This may prevent significant increase in calcium load with higher stimulation rates as it occurs in rabbit myocardium which has a lower cytosolic sodium concentration and a positive force-frequency relation (26). Because intracellular sodium concentration was shown to be higher in failing compared to nonfailing human myocardium, this mechanism may additionally contribute to the altered forcefrequency relation (20).
Energetic considerations
Because SR Ca2+ATPase is sensitive to impaired energy supply, one may argue that altered systolic and diastolic function result from decreased SR calcium accumulation as a consequence of altered energetics. In order to study this possibility, frequency-dependent alterations of myocardial force and oxygen consumption were measured simultaneously (23). Figure 9 shows a graph relating myocardial oxygen consumption to force-time integral (calculated from developed and diastolic force). Both variables derive from the same muscle strip of an end-stage failing heart exhibiting a pronounced rise in diastolic force with increasing stimulation rate. As is obvious, there is a close linear correlation between both parameters over the whole frequency range investigated. If the rise in diastolic force would be the consequence of impaired energy supply to the calcium pump and the contractile machinery, this relation would no longer be linear. Therefore, the continuous increase in oxygen consumption in proportion with the increase in force-time integral strongly suggests

Force-frequency relations in nonfailing and failing animal myocardium
B. Crozatier Unite INSERM U400, FacuIte de Mectecine, Creteil, France
Abstract
This paper reviews the recent data concerning the force-frequency relations in experimental animals with heart failure. After a brief overview of the nature of these relations, which are induced by 2 opposite phenomena, the potentiation of force of contraction by heart rate and the restitution process, the paper reviews first the force-frequency relations in isolated failing myocardium. This is followed by a review of recent data obtained in the in situ failing heart. The cellular mechanisms of the force-frequency relations are then discussed.
Introduction
In most mammalian species, changes in stimulation frequency induce an increase in contractile force . This phenomenon (the treppe effect or positive staircase) was described more than a century ago by Bowdich. However, this relation is not always positive. In some species, particularly in rats, it is negative and, in humans where it is usually positive, it has been shown to be negative in heart failure (15,17,25,27,29).
Force-frequency relations can be interpreted in terms of 2 opposite phenomena: frequency potentiation and restitution, which coexist in the same preparation. In this review, we will first quickly consider the basic mechanisms responsible for the force-frequency relations and their cellular basis. We will then review the results of experiments performed in animals with heart failure.
Nature of the force-frequency relations
Frequency potentiation is the increase in force of contraction induced by an increased heart rate. This is the basis for the positive staircase (1, 2, 7, 9, 18,20), which has been attributed to increased transsarcolemmal Ca entry and loading of intracellular stores due to an

78 B. Crozatier
increased number of depolarizations per unit of time (11). The rate-dependent regulation of dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ current (lea) has been recently evaluated in isolated atrial cardiac myocytes using whole cell patch-clamp technique (30). lea was potentiated in a graded manner when the rate of stimulation was increased with an increase in peak amplitude and a slowing in current decay. Ca2+ influx was markedly increased within seconds. Isoproterenol potentiated this increase in lea' Other phenomena including reduced Ca2+ extrusion by the Na+/ Ca2+ exchanger and lag of the Na+ pump function may also contribute to frequency potentiation.
In opposition with force potentiation, when the interval between beats is too short, the force of the following contraction may be decreased due to an incomplete restitution process. Restitution is the time necessary for Ca2+to reach the releasable site by translocation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum after its uptake from the contractile apparatus (19, 38, Fig. 1). There is also evidence however that delayed recovery of the Ca2+release channel also plays a role in the restitution process (32).
A method to analyze the restitution process is to introduce a test stimulus after varying time-intervals in isolated prerations previously paced at regular rates (28). With increased delays, the force of contraction increases until it reaches a plateau, describing a restitution curve. When the rate of regular stimulation is higher, the curve is shifted upwards, due to the potention induced by the increased pacing rate. Similar results have been found in the isolated heart with the measurement of dP/dtmax at fixed end-diastolic volume (6).
The addition of these two opposite phenomena (restitution and potentiation) may, thus, induce a positive staircase when the restitution process is close to its optimum or, conversely, a negative staircase when restitution is incomplete. The staircase is also negative in species such as rats in which the calcium avalaible for contraction originates principally from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The mechanical restitution process has been studied in conscious dogs using the simple beat elastance analysis by Freeman and Colston (13).

Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the cellular basis of the force-frequency relations. An increase in the rate of stimulation increases the calcium entry through the dihydropyridine (DHP) sensitive Ca2+ channels. This increases the calcium available for contraction and loads the calcium stores. This is the basis of the potentiation process. After a contraction (I). the calcium originating from the foot region (tenninal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the T tubules) is again taken up by the Ca2+ ATPase located in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The time necessary for calcium to reach the sites of release (3) is responsible, at least in part, for the restitution process.

Force-frequency relations in nonfailing and failing animal myocardium 79
Frequency potentiation and restitution are also the determinants of postextrasystolic potentiation, since the force of the postextrasystolic beat is related to the prematurity of the extrasystolic beat and the duration of the subsequent pause (5). The decrease of the potentiation of force has been shown in isolated hearts to be exponential, the time constant of this exponential being attributed to calcium recirculation (39).
Force-frequency relations in isolated failing myocardium
In contrast with human myocardium in which a number of studies analyzed the forcefrequency relations of failing hearts (15, 17, 25, 27, 29), few studies were performed in experimental animals. Although studies performed in human myocardium can lead to important conclusions concerning the mechanisms of decompensation of the heart, they do not abolish the importance of experimental studies. The origin of calcium available for contraction is different among species (12): it mostly originates from transsarcolemmic movements in frogs, from the sarcoplasmic retitulum in rats and has both origins in most mammalian species such as rabbits, dogs or humans. The force-frequency relations are different among these species and their modifications induced by heart failure may suggest specific abnormalities induced by this syndrome.
The force-frequency relations were recently studied in the myocardium obtained from 2 species: cardiomyopathic syrian hamsters and dogs with pacing induced heart failure (21). In syrian hamsters, the force-frequency relation was biphasic in both normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters with an initial negative phase which was markedly attenuated in normal hamsters by increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration. This phase was followed by a positive staircase in both strains of hamsters but the slope was significantly lower in myopathic syrian hamsters. In both strains, the addition of phenylephrine induced an uniphasic positive staircase. In contrast with the decrease of the positive staircase in syrian cardiomyopathic hamsters, in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure the tension-frequency relations were similar to those of control dogs and was not modulated by phenylephrine.
Besides the positive staircase and, thus, force potentiation by the increase of heart rate, the restitution phenomenon appears to playa major role in the abnormalities of the forcefrequency relations in heart failure. In the study of Li and Rouleau (21 ), the initial negative staircase observed in syrian hamsters was attributed to a limitation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling since the negative staircase disappeared under ryanodine. We analyzed further the restitution phenomenon (10) in a model of heart failure produced in rabbits by the association of a pressure plus double overload. This leads to a marked (close to 100 %) left ventricular hypertrophy and a cardiac decompensation within one month (14). In this model, we previously described abnormalities of the beta-adrenergic system (4). We also analyzed in detail the force-frequency relations (10) in isolated hearts. The force-frequency relation was positive in normal hearts and was negative in failing hearts. Although the differences were statistically significant, they were small but major abnormalities were found when postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP) and poststimulation potentiation (PSP) were analyzed. PSP was clearly positive in normal hearts with an increased peak LV dP/dt in the beat following the regular pacing beats when heart rate was increased progressively from 100 to 200 beats/min. In contrast, contractility increased only slightly for heart rate

80 B. Crozatier
increases up to 150 beats/min and decreased thereafter. This was associated with an increase in end-diastolic pressure, suggesting that there was a calcium overload of the cell. Such diastolic abnormalities have been demonstrated by Gwathmey et al. (16) in isolated preparations obtained from patients in end-stage heart failure.
The role of sarcoplasmic reticulum in the force-frequency relations was clearly shown in our study in rabbits (10) since both PESP and PSP were completely abolished by pretreatment by ryanodine in both normal and failing hearts. Our data strongly suggested that, since for the utilized doses, ryanodine blocks sarcoplasmic calcium release (23) and since abnormalities of the force-frequency disappeared in failing hearts under ryanodine, forcefrequency relation abnormalities were due to abnormalities in sarcoplasmic reticulum. This could be due either by an abnormal calcium uptake which has been already shown in hypertrophy and heart failure (see (22) for review) and/or to an abnormal calcium circulation and/or release.
The relation between alterations in intracellular calcium handling and the forcefrequency relation has been analyzed by Hasenfuss' group in human cardiac muscle strips obtained from patients with end-stage heart failure (29). The inverse force-frequency relation has been attributed to a decreased calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (29). This group also showed a decreased protein level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase which decreased more than those of phospholamban while protein levels of ryanodine receptors, calsequestrine, and calreticulin were not different from the control (24). In contrast, the gene expression of the Na/Ca exchanger was increased (35).
The effect of cardiac overload and failure on ryanodine receptors is different in different species. A recent study by Rannou et al. (34) showed a decreased ryanodine receptor density in guinea-pig and in ferrets during the development of cardiac hypertrophy but not in rats while the density was decreased in all 3 species in heart failure. Similarly, a decrease in myocardial ryanodine receptors was found in dogs early in the development of heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing (37). Thus, besides a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, abnormalities in calcium release exist in some models and species and may modify the force-frequency relation.
In our model of cardiac failure in rabbits, we recently studied sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, which was significantly but only slightly decreased (by 20 %) with an absence of change in ryanodine receptor density (3). It is unlikely that the small decrease in calcium uptake capacity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for the abnormal force-frequency relations in this model. In our study (3), we also showed an abnormality of the ultrastructure of the heart with abnormally dilated T tubules. They appeared as a dilatation of normally present tubules rather than a proliferation of new T tubules along the hypertrophied contractile apparatus. A harmonious hypertrophy would have probably lead to a normal aspect of T tubules along hypertrophied myofibrils. Since T tubules correspond to the zone where sarcolemmal plasma membrane is closely related to sarcoplasmic reticulum, inducing the calcium induced-calcium release, it is possible to speculate that although sarcoplasmic reticulum itself was not directly observed in this study, an inadequate calcium release may occur in the failing heart even though the amount of ryanodine channel and membrane calcium channel is not modified. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by cellular calcium imaging studies.
Another study in rat failing myocardium (26) recently showed an abnormal force-frequency relationship in which a decreased rate of calcium accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was not the primary cause. In this study, a pulsus alternans was produced in Langendorff perfused hearts obtained from a strain of rats with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (SHHFIMcc-faT) during an increased ventricular pacing rate. This alternation was abolished by I mM caffeine, showing the role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in its

development but 50-500 nM thapsigargin, which blocks calcium uptake, did not induce alternans in normal myocardium. The intimate mechanism which induces mechanical alternans (an alternation of strong and weak beats) is not known but this study shows that although the sarcoplasmic reticulum is involved in its development, other mechanisms than abnormal calcium reuptake are its primary cuase. Similarly with our study (3), the authors concluded that the appearance of abnormal force-frequency relations may be due to a slow rate of calcium transport from the uptake sites (the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum) to the release sites (the junctional and corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum) or that the ryanodine channels require a finite time to recover from inactivation.
Force-frequency relations in the hypertrophied and failing in situ heart
We recently evaluated the force-frequency relations in the conscious state in the model of heart failure in dogs (36). In contrast to the study of Li and Rouleau in which the forcefrequency relations were not impared in isolated muscles obtained from dogs with the same pacing-induced heart failure (21), we found a smaller increase in left ventricular dP/dt max during regular pacing in failing dogs than in control dogs and a decreased poststimulation potentiation. The diffence between our in vivo study (36) and the in vitro study (21) in the same model of heart failure and in the same species may be due to a number of factors: temperature (29°C in the bath), calcium concentration, rate of stimulation (1-60 beats/min in vitro, 120 to 240 beats/min in our study), etc. Our results can, however, be compared to those published some years ago by Pouleur et al. (31) who found, in the in situ heart, a decrease in poststimulation potentiation in dogs with cardiac volume overload. The results of the force-frequency relations were however different by other aspects since Pouleur et al. (31) found an increased stimulation potentiation but the models were different since, in this study (31), the phase during which the animals were studied was the initial phase of cardiac overload and no sign of heart failure was present.
Mechanical restitution has been studied by Prabhu and Freeman (3) by the analysis of postextrasystolic contraction in close-chest dogs with heart failure induced by rapid pacing which was prolongated. The authors (3) attributed this prolongation to an abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium kinetics.
In a recent study by Eising et al. (8), the force-frequency relations were further studied in a model of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy in a different species, the pig. Before heart failure, the force-frequency relation was flat but, importantly, it showed a significant positive slope during dobutamine infusion showing thus an amplification in the in situ heart of the force-frequency relation by beta-receptor stimulation. This can be compared with the study of Piot et al. (30) in isolated human cardiomyocytes where the increase in lea induced by an increase in pacing rate was potentiated by isoproterenol. In contrast, in failing in situ hearts, beta-adrenergic stimulation did not amplify the force-frequency relation (8). Besides abnormalities of the force-frequency relations which have been described in vitro, this phenomenon may play an important role in the impaired response to excercise in patients with heart failure.

Conclusions
This brief review was focused on the recent results concerning the force-frequency relation in failing and nonfailing animal myocardium.
Although results were different depending upon the model, the species, and the experimental conditions, this review shows the physiological importance of these relationships. Obviously, they playa major role in the adaptation to exercise. Their analysis is, thus, most useful for the evaluation of the clinical status of patients with heart failure. Another important aspect of these relations is that they may help to suspect subcellular abnormalities by the study of potentiation and restitution which can be confirmed by direct cellular and biochemical studies.

Abstract
Early studies in enzymatically isolated animal cardiomyocytes indicated that voltage-gated "L-type" Ca2+ currents (leaL) can be upregulated following an increase of the frequency of activation. Recently, we evidenced a similar regulation of leaL in human cardiomyocytes from both left and right ventricles and atria over a physiopathological range of stimulations (between 0.5 and 5 Hz). This regulation, enhanced by the l3-adrenergic stimulation, may be involved in the frequency-dependent potentiation of cardiac contractile force in the human healthy myocardium. We show here that the frequency-dependent regulation of leaL is controled by the level of phosphorylation, as well as dephosphorylation, of the Ca2+ channels. It was enhanced following activation of the protein kinase A activated by intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Therefore, we anticipate that all agents stimulating cAMP production will favor this process, which was demonstrated here by activating 5HT-4 receptors using serotonin. Alternatively, it was also enhanced by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid
which prevents Ca2+ channels dephosphorylation. Alteration or abnormal modulation by 13-
adrenergic receptor stimulation of the frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL may partly explain the altered force-frequency relation described in heart failure.
Key words Human cardiomyocytes - Ca2+ channels - frequency-induced upregulation force-frequency relation - l3-adrenergic stimulation
Introduction
Heart rate has long been known as a determinant of cardiac performance. In many animal species, it has been shown that increasing the cardiac frequency induces a positive inotropic effect, known as the force-frequency relation or Bowditch "staircase" (4). Recent experiments showing amplification of the force-frequency relation by l3-adrenergic receptor stimulation and by exercise in vivo have reemphasized the importance of this potent inotropic mechanism in the physiology of the normal heart (46). Various subcellular mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the force-frequency relation. Curiously, a role of L-type Ca2+ channels, which constitute a major target of the l3-adrenergic receptor stimulation, has been ignored or minimized. The aim of this paper is to show that the activity of

86 S. Lemaire et al.
L- (but not T-) type Ca2+channels is regulated by their frequency of activation and that they may, thereby, be involved in the regulation of the force frequency-relation.
Force-frequency relationship
The frequency-dependent potentiation of cardiac contractile force was first described by Bowditch in 1871 (4). Since then, numerous studies have shown that the positive forcefrequency relation is present in vitro in most animal species (12, 22, 49), including humans (6). Moreover, increased contractility (positive inotropic effect) in response to rapid atrial pacing has been demonstrated in vivo in healthy patients with normal left ventricular function (16). Although the molecular events underlying the force-frequency effect on inotropic state are not perfectly understood, multiple mechanisms have been proposed. There is evidence to suggest that under basal conditions this phenomenon is related to increased Ca2+ availability for the myofilaments (29). Pieske et aI., using the bioluminescent protein aequorin to measure intracellular Ca2+ cycling, also showed recently that the forcefrequency relation of human nonfailing myocardium results from frequency-dependent increases in the intracellular Ca2+ transients (39). An increased amount of Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum at higher rates of stimulation was suggested to result from both enhanced transsarcolemmal Ca2+influx through the L-type Ca2+channels per unit of time and reduced time available for diastolic Ca2+efflux through the Na+/Ca2+exchanger leading to greater filling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (2) .
Frequency-dependent potentiation of cardiac contractile force appears to be a major physiological mechanism for the regulation of myocardial performance in the normal heart in vivo. In physiological conditions, increased reflex norepinephrine release and circulating catecholamines during exercise induceboth positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, so that heart rate changes are always coupled with contractility changes. To study the effects of heart rate alone during exercise in conscious dogs, Miura et al. controlled the atrial rate by atrial pacing after pharmacologically slowing the spontaneous sinus rate (28). They showed a pronounced negative inotropic influence after slowing the heart rate, supporting the conclusion that heart rate per se influences myocardial contractility during exercise. Using the same experimental canine model, Kambayashi et al. demonstrated that ~-adren­ ergic stimulation with graded perfusion of dobutamine under resting conditions causes a dose-dependent increase of the force-frequency potentiation (19). In addition to the direct myocardial effect of ~-adrenergic receptor stimulation and the basal force-frequency relation at rest, these results suggest that the amplification of the force-frequency effect during ~-adrenergic stimulation is an important indirect mechanism regulating myocardial contractility in vivo (46). Both phosphorylation of L-type Ca2+ channels by cAMPdependent protein kinase A, which enhances transarcolemmal Ca2+entry, and phosphorylation of phospholamban, which increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading via regulation of Ca2+ pump ATPase, may theoretically be involved in the amplification by ~-adrenergic stimulation of the force-frequency effect on myocardial contraction.
Recent experiments in isolated myocardium from patients with heart failure demonstrated that the high frequency-induced potentiation of cardiac contractile force was significantly impaired or absent, depending on stages of heart failure (30, 38,47). Similar findings were demonstrated by increasing pacing rates during atrial or ventricular stimulation in human hearts with low left ventricular function (10, 16). Pieske et al. observed that

Frequency-dependent facilitation of Ca channels in human cardiomyocytes 87
the decline in contractility at higher rates of stimulation was associated with a decrease in the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration in failing human myocardium (39). These data indicate that the altered force-frequency relation in failing human myocardium may result from decreased intracellular Ca2+ transients at higher stimulation frequencies. A reduced amount of Ca2+ entering the cell through L-type Ca2+ channel, a reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake capacity or a defect of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels may contribute to explain these findings. In contrast, changes in Ca2+ sensitivity or changes in the behavior of the contractile proteins appear to be unlikely. Moreover, it was shown recently that l3-adrenergic amplification of the force-frequency effect on myocardial contractility was impaired in pigs with cardiac failure (8). Since a number of steps in the l3-adrenergic stimulation pathway have been described as abnormal in human failing heart, loss of l3-adrenergic control of the force-frequency relation may have a major functional significance in patients with heart failure (46).
Transmembrane Ca2+ channels in cardiac cells
Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are the main route for Ca2+ entry into cardiac myocytes and, thereby, have a major role in the development and control of both heart contractility and pacemaking activity (15, 25, 55). These proteins can transduce an electrical signal (membrane depolarization) into a chemical signal (transarcolemmal Ca2+ influx) during the transient action potential. Cardiac cells express only two types of transmembrane Ca2+ currents (ICa): the L-type ICa (ICaL; L for "long lasting"), which corresponds to the "slow inward current" originally observed in multicellular preparations 30 years ago (25, 42, 45), and the T-type ICa (lCaT; T for "transient") discovered a decade ago using patch-clamp experiments (1, 25). The L- and T-type Ca2+ channels have clearly distinct electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. Overall, they are distinguished commonly by their activation threshold and their sensitivity to sustained depolarization. ICaL is activated by strong depolarizations (> -40 mV). ICaTis low-voltage-activated (> -60 mV). IcaL is fully available at the resting membrane potentials of -50 mV whereas ICaT requires more negative voltages
« -50 mV). IcaL is the target of different exogenous synthetic ligands, termed "Ca2+
channels modulators", such as dihydropyridines (DHPs), phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines. In contrast, there is a deficit of specific ligands for ICaT though the new IcaTselective compound Ro 40-5967 (mibefradil) opens interesting perspectives.
The structural characterization ofL-type Ca2+ channels has been performed in two steps: purification of the Ca2+ channel provided the subunit composition of this multimeric protein and molecular cloning identified several genes encoding the different subunits. Specific ligands such as DHPs and the discovery of a rich source of high affinity DHP-receptors in skeletal muscle T-tubules (11) has allowed demonstration that skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels are formed of several associated subunits: the pore-forming subunit cd which bears pharmacological binding sites for Ca2+ channel modulators, the a2 subunit associated via a disulfide bridge to the 0 subunit, acytoplasmic 13 subunit, and a -y subunit. It is believed that cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels are also formed by the association of an a I subunit with a2-o and 13 subunits related to that from skeletal muscle (Fig. IA). Molecular cloning and structure-function studies in heterologous expression systems have provided insights in the molecular basis of a I subunit of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel. It is encoded by the Class Cgene and exhibits alternative splicing variants that are able to carry

Fig. 1 Structure and major regulations of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel. (A) The cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel is composed of three subunits: the transmembrane ex I and ex2--y subunits and the cytoplasmic l3-subunit. (B ) Regulation of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel. Membrane depolarization during the action potential is the primary effector (I). Frequency of activation (i.e., time-dependent gating properties during the diastolic interval between action potentials) is also an important determinant of Ca2+ channel activity (2). Intracellular cAMP, augmented or, alternatively, decreased by various hormones and transmitter systems, modulates protein kinase A and, thereby, Ca2+ channel activity (3).
specific pharmacological profiles (51). Taken together, these results indicate that a first degree of diversity in L-type Ca2+ channels is provided by O'J subunit(s). A second degree of diversity may be brought about by the variety of combinations with different ~ subunits (four genes identified). Of major interest, the ~ subunits are to be considered as endogenous modulators of Ca2+ channel activity (0'1 subunit) influencing their electrical as well as their pharmacological properties. In contrast, one must realize that the gene(s) encoding the T-type Ca2+ channels has (have) not yet been identified, owed to the lack of specific ligands which has impaired their structural and functional characterization.

Frequency-dependent facilitation of Ca channels in human cardiomyocytes 89
ICaL is the trigger of the cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The influx of Ca2+ through L-type Ca2+ channels is responsible for the action potential plateau and induces a release of Ca2+ ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum, a process named "Ca2+ induced-Ca2+ release" which evokes the contraction (2). The function of the T-type Ca2+ channel is largely unknown but because of its low threshold of activation or its high expression in sino-atrial node cells, a role in pacemaking activity has been suggested (14). ICaT is not detected electrophysiologically in adult rat ventricular and human atrial cells (24, 34, 43, 44).
Regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels activity
Ca2+ channels are closed at the normal membrane resting potentials. During the fast upstroke of the action potential, they are gated into open state by membrane depolarization (Fig. 1B). Although voltage is the primary effector, modulation of Ca2+ channels activity by a variety of neurotransmitters, hormones, drugs, and intracellular second messengers is also fundamental (15, 25, 55). Best known is the regulation of ICaL by l3-adrenergic receptors stimulation via a protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation pathway. Activation of 131 as well as 132 adrenergic receptors stimulates the production of intracellular second messenger cAMP via Gs protein and adenylate-cyclase cascade (Fig. 1B). Liberation of catalytic subunits of protein kinase A by cAMP increases both the availability and the opening probability of Ca2+ channels via the phosphorylation of either the Ca2+ channel protein itself or another closely associated protein (25, 32, 55). The large increase in leaL peak amplitude explains in part the positive inotropic effect observed on cardiac myocytes in the presence of l3-adrenergic agonists.
Frequency-dependent regulation of leal
In addition to membrane depolarization and Ca2+ channel phosphorylation, modulation of leaL by frequency of Ca2+ channel activation is also probably of major importance for heart physiology (Fig. lB). Early studies suggested that an increase in the rate of cell stimulation can up-regulate Ca2+ channel activity in cardiac cells. Noble and Shimoni (33) were the first to report this regulation in frog atrial fibers which was confirmed later at the single cell level (48). Despite differences in terms of kinetics and underlying mechanisms, similar effects were described in enzymatically dissociated mammalian heart cells (9, 23, 37,43,44,54, 56). Although these effects were not always consistent among studies (20), it is now clear that an increase in the rate of cell stimulation induces two opposite effects depending on the experimental recording conditions used. Decrease of leaL occurs when cells are stimulated from depolarized membrane holding potentials, reflecting a reduction of Ca2+ channel availability for opening because of incomplete voltage-dependent reactivation (9, 18,26,37,44). Indeed, full recovery from inactivation requires more negative membrane potentials. Alternatively, an increase in the rate of stimulation can produce a potentiation OfIeaLonly when cells are stimulated from negative holding potentials (9, 23, 27, 33, 37,

(B) Different waveforms of IC'L evoked at -10 mY from HP -80 mY using various frequencies of stimulation, i.e., various durations of the diastolic interval between stimulations: 0.1,0.2,0.5,0.8, and I seconds interpulses (as quoted) in a human atrial myocyte. Note the graded slowing of IC" decay with shortening intervals. Methods: Human cardiomyocytes were obtained and enzymatically (0.5 mg/ml protease, type 14, Sigma; 0.6 mg/ml collagenase, type I, clostridium histolyticum and 0.2 mg/ml elastase, Boehringer Mannheim) isolated as described before (34-36, 41). Neonatal rat ventricular cells were prepared from I day old animals using a similar enzymatic procedure. In both cases, Ica were recorded and measured as described previously (41, 43, 44, 52, 53). Bath solution contained (mmolll): TEACI (140), CaCI2 (2), MgCI2 (\.I), 4-AP (4), HEPES (25); adjusted to pH 7.4 with TEAOH. Recording pipettes contained (in mmolll): CsCI (130), EGTA (10), HEPES (25), (Mg) ATP (3), (Mg) GTP (0.4); adjusted to pH = 7.4 with CsOH. The waveforms ofIe, were measured at room temperature 2 to 10 hours after cell dispersion using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique (amplifier Biologic model RK-300, Grenoble, France) as described before (44). Use-dependent facilitation of lea was examined using trains of stimulation at various rates (41).

Frequency-dependent facilitation of Ca channels in human cardiomyocytes 91
43,44,48,53,54). In mammalian cardiomyocytes, the high frequency-induced potentiation of leaL consists of both a moderate increase of peak current amplitude and a marked slowing of the inactivation kinetics. The increase of peak leaL is only a consequence of the slowing of current decay which has been proposed to reflect a time-, voltage-, and Ca2+dependent overshoot in the reactivation of leaL (37, 44, 54). It should be noted that another type of voltage-dependent facilitation, which is independent of the rate of stimulation, has been described (40, 52). It is also worth noting that, in cardiac cells, T-type Ca2+ channels are not subject to modulation by the rate of activation as illustrated in Fig. 2A.
We have revently shown that leaL can also be up-regulated by the rate of activation in human cardioymocytes (41). This regulation was observed in myocytes from both right and left atria and ventricles. Therefore, frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL seems to be a general feature of human cardiomyocytes, i.e., irrespective of their topological origin. As illustrated in the right atrial human cardiomyocyte (Fig. 2B), leaL peak amplitude is augmented and its decay is slowed when the rate of activation of Ca2+ channels is increased from 0.1 Hz to I Hz. This change of leaL waveform, which contributes to increased Ca2+ influx during depolarization, occurs at all voltages activating an inward leaL (41). Interestingly, leaL is potentiated in a graded manner with increasing rates of stimulation (between 0.5 Hz and 5 Hz), i.e., with decreasing diastolic interval between two stimulations (Fig. 2B). As in animal cardiomyocytes, a negative membrane resting potential is required. There is no frequency-dependent potentiation when leaLis evoked from resting membrane potentials positive to -50 mY (41). Rather, no effect or a decrease in effect is observed with voltagedependent inactivation of Ca2+ channels. Interestingly and in contrast with results obtained from hundreds of rat ventricular cells in our laboratory, this regulation was not found in all human cardiomyocytes. In particular, we determined that it was altered in cardiomyocytes of patients with end-stage heart failure (ejection fraction < 40 %) and in those of patients treated with Ca2+ channel antagonists orland l3-adrenergic blockers (41). Therefore, the ability of L-type Ca2+ channels to be regulated by the frequency of activation may be a feature of the healthy heart.
Regulation by cAMP·dependent phosphorylation of Ca2+ channels
We have shown that l3-adrenergic receptor stimulation enhances the high frequency-induced upregulation of leaL in human cardiomyocytes (41). As illustrated in Fig. 3A, and in addition to its well-known potentiating effect on peak current, isoproterenol induced the frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL which was absent in control conditions. Therefore, a
higher rate of activation, which is expected from the positive chronotropic effect of the 13-
adrenergic stimulation, is likely to amplify the direct effect of the l3-adrenergic stimulation on L-type Ca2+ channels activity contributing to further increase of Ca2+ entry during the depolarization. This effect is related to changes in the gating properties rather than an increase in the number of activable Ca2+ channels (43 , 44).
Enhancement of the frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL by l3-adrenergic stimulation involves cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the L-type Ca2+ channels in rat ventricular cells (53). Fig. 3B shows that the permeable analogue dibutyryl cAMP, by

Methods: Cells were prepared and stimulated as described in Fig. 2. Drugs (Sigma) were prepared as concentrated stock solutions which were diluted at the desired working concentrations in the test solution. Control and test solutions were applied to the exterior of each cell tested using a multiple capillary perfusion system placed in the vicinity of the cell (4 1,52). Each capillary is fed by a reservoir 50 em above the bath. Rapid (at most seconds) and complete solution changes can be made by switching from the opening from one capillary to the next.
directly activating the intracellular protein kinase A, can also promote the high frequencyinduced upregulation of ICaL in human cardiomyocytes, mimicking [3-adrenergic receptors stimulation. Therefore, one would expect such a modulation for all factors stimulating intracellular cAMP production. To further test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of serotonin which stimulates 5-HT4 receptors in human atrial myocytes and, thereby, increases ICaL by activating cAMP cascade (35). Fig. 3C shows that stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors by serotonin first increases peak ICaL' but also can result in the promotion of the high frequency-induced upregulation of ICaL'
These data suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of L-type Ca2+ channels is a key event modulating the forcefrequency regulation of ICaL in human cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that preventing dephosphorylation of L-type Ca2+ channels is also an alternative to enhance the frequency-dependent facilitation of ICaL' Indeed, the phosphorylated state of Ca2+ channels, and thereby current amplitude, is the product of a dynamic equilibrium between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes. To assess this hypothesis, we exposed the cardiac cells to the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid

Frequency-dependent facilitation of Ca channels in human cardiomyocytes 93
known to increase leaL in absence of (3-adrenergic receptors stimulation (17, 21). Fig. 3D shows that okadaic acid increases leaL peak amplitude and can promote the frequencydependent facilitation of leaL' Therefore, frequency-dependent regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels can be modulated by both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

Physiological significance of the frequencydependent facilitation of leal
In addition to other intracellular mechanisms, the high frequency-induced upregulation of L-type Ca2+ channels has been suggested to be involved in the frequency-dependent potentiation of cardiac contractile force in the human healthy myocardium by Piot et al. (41). Indeed, this sophisticated and short term regulatory system which ensures a fine graded augmentation of transmembrane Ca2+ entry at higher rates of stimulation, allows a sudden adjustment of intracellular Ca2+ loading and, as a natural consequence, of myocardial contractility. Of major interest, it occurs over a range of frequencies corresponding to heart rates frequently encountered in human physiopathology. This process, which is highly sensitive to (3-adrenergic receptors stimulation via a cAMP pathway, may be also a major mechanism involved in the amplification by [3-adrenergic stimulation of the force-frequency effect on myocardial contraction (Fig. 4). Moreover, it would confer a key role to L-type Ca2+ channels in the notion of myocardic reserve. Persons, such as athletes, provided with a low heart beating rate (e.g., 40/50 beats per min) would be expected to have more reserve in terms of increased transmembrane Ca2+ entry during severe exercise (e.g., 180 beats per

min) than those who have an already high heart beating rate (e.g., 80-100 beat per min) at rest. Thus, we anticipate that this regulation of transmembrane Ca2+ influx may be crucial in the adaptation of the nonfailing human heart to stress and exervise (Fig. 4).
Of major interest, many neurotransmitters and hormones receptors are also positively or negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, modulating protein kinase A-dependent regulation and, thereby, modulating frequency-dependent facilitation of Ca2+ channel activity (Fig. 4). A variety of drugs acting at different levels of the ~-adrenergic cascade, such as ~­ adrenergic agonists or antagonists and phosphodiesterases inhibitors, are used clinically to modulate cardiac inotropism via cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of L-type Ca2+ channels. According to this mechanism, heart rate needs to be considered in order to better understand inotropic effect of these drugs.
Frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL in failing heart
In addition to abnormal intracellular [Ca2+]j handling (3, 13, 22), both high frequencyinduced upregulation and ~-adrenergic stimulation of l eaL have been described as abnormal in failing human myocardium (36, 41). An alteration of transarcolemmal Ca2+ signaling via L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may partly explain the altered force-frequency relation described in heart failure (10, 16, 30,38,39, 47). Moreover, an abnormal modulation of the frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL by ~-adrenergic receptor stimulation may partly explain the loss of ~-adrenergic control of the force-frequency relation in these patients (46). Indeed, stimulation by isoprenaline preserves the positive force-frequency in the nonfailing myocardium but fails to restore it in the failing human heart (50). It is possible that this observation reflects simply a down regulation of ~-adrenergic receptors in the failing hearts (5, 31), which leads to lower intracellular cAMP. However, it is also possible that Ca2+ channels themselves are altered in terms of structure (nature or stoichiometry of associated subunits) or of regulation by second messengers and phosphorylating-dephosphorylating agents.
The frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL was also altered in patients pretreated with Ca2+ antagonists and/or ~-blockers (i .e., classes IV and II of Vaughan-Williams) (41). Very interestingly, it can be partly restored in presence of isoproterenol both in nonfailing and failing patients but not in failing hearts that were not pretreated (41). These observations suggest two ideas: (i) that the regulation is altered by the disease itsel f in those patients that are not protected from Ca2+ overload at high rates of stimulation, and (ii) that agents that minimize Ca2+ overload preserve cell integrity and, thereby, prevent complete alteration of the regulation of Ca2+ channel activity by high rates of stimulation.
Concluding remarks and perspectives
The activity of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels is expected to depend markedly on the heart rate which finely controls the duration and amount of Ca2+ influx and, thereby, the ampli-

tude of the contraction. The frequency-dependent facilitation of leaL may explain, at least in part, both the frequency-dependent potentiation ofcardiac contractile force and its amplification by (3-adrenergic receptors stimulation in the human healthy myocardium. Such a rapid regulation might also be a major adaptive mechanism of the healthy human heart to exercise or stress. Alteration of this mechanism and its implication in failing hearts needs to be confirmed.
At the molecular level, it will be important to explore the mechanisms involved in the frequency-dependent facilitation of Ca2+ channels and the reason for its potential alteration in heart failure. Existence of multiple n 1C isoforms and differential regulation by distinct (3-subunits are expected to generate Ca2+ influx with various waveforms and regulatory profiles by voltage and phosphorylation. For example, the strong predepolarization-dependent
facilitation of leaL expressed from the class C channel is abolished when coexpressed in
Xenopus laevis oocytes with the (32 subunit (instead of the (31, (33 or (34 subunits) (7). There is also a real possibility of close interaction between Ca2+ channels and other systems which may control its activity (e.g., Ca2+ coming from the sarcoplasmic reticulum may exerts local influence on the gating of leaL) It will also be important to understand how Ca2+ channel activity is altered in heart failure and the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of agents targeting Ca2+ channels.

Electrophysiological aspects of changes in heart rate

Abstract
Cardiac action potentials undergo characteristic changes in response to increasing pacing frequency, i.e., the resting potential becomes less negative (depolarization), the amplitude decreases, and the action potential duration (APD) shortens. The electrophysiological properties of the major cardiac inward and outward currents are discussed with respect to their possible contribution to rate-dependent changes in AP shape. Short diastolic intervals may not allow sufficient time for channel recovery. Incomplete recovery from inactivation will reduce both inward (INa' leO> and outward (Ito) currents and hence lead to APD shortening or prolongation, respectively. Incomplete deactivation during diastole will increase current and, in the case of the delayed rectifier IKs' produces rate-dependent APD shortening. Heterogeneity in current density of myocytes from various regions within the ventricular wall complicates the direct translation of rate-dependent changes in APD into changes of the QT interval of the ECG.
With increasing rates of stimulation, K+ accumulates within the tubular system. Membrane depolarization may be attributed to this frequency-dependent increase in [K+]o' whereas APD shortening is not mimicked by high [K+]o' Nevertheless, the various cardiac K+ channels differ in their sensitivity to extracellular [K+]o' Some of the frequency-dependent effects of drugs with class III action may be related to an influence of [K+]o on drug potency to block K+ channels.
Key words Heart rate - action potentials - membrane currents - K+ currents K+ accumulation - antiarrhythmic drugs with class III action
Introduction
The relationship between the QT interval of the electrocardiogram and heart rate was discovered by Bazett in 1920 (5). In later years, the microelectrode technique was adapted for application in isolated heart muscle (I 0) and provided a direct approach for investigating the relationship between intracellular action potentials (AP) and stimulation frequency in isolated heart muscle (30).
